Secondary metabolite (SM) production inAspergillus nigerJSC-093350089, isolated from the International Space Station (ISS), is reported, along with a comparison to the experimentally established strain ATCC 1015. The analysis revealed enhanced production levels of naphtho-γ-pyrones and therapeutically relevant SMs, including bicoumanigrin A, aurasperones A and B, and the antioxidant pyranonigrin A. Genetic variants that may be responsible for increased SM production levels in JSC-093350089 were identified. These findings include INDELs within the predicted promoter region offlbA, which encodes a developmental regulator that modulates pyranonigrin A production via regulation of Fum21. The pyranonigrin A biosynthetic gene cluster was confirmed inA. niger, which revealed the involvement of a previously undescribed gene,pyrE, in its biosynthesis. UVC sensitivity assays enabled characterization of pyranonigrin A as a UV resistance agent in the ISS isolate. Filamentous fungi are ubiquitous in spacecraft environments due to anthropogenic contamination and an inability to completely sterilize the craft and cargo (Pierson, 2001;Novikova et al., 2006;Van Houdt et al., 2012). Microbial infections are a major health risk for astronauts, and are exacerbated by the combined stresses of microgravity, sleep disruption, alterations in food intake, confined living space, and high levels of radiation that can compromise the immune system (Pierson, 2001;Sonnenfeld et al., 2003). Additionally, several studies have indicated that spacecraft environments increase microbial virulence and antimicrobial resistance (Tixador et al., 1985;Wilson et al., 2007,2008). As we make strides toward human interplanetary exploration, investigations into the characteristics of filamentous fungi that reside in spacecraft environments are critical for crew health. Additionally, such studies present diverse industrial and therapeutic opportunities, as fungi produce a plethora of bioactive secondary metabolites (SMs) in response to external stressors. These small molecules often kill or inhibit growth of other organisms, enabling fungi to successfully compete within the complex ecosystem they reside in. While some SMs are toxic to humans, others have diverse industrial and therapeutic applications, including antibiotic, anticancer, antioxidant, immunosuppressant, and cholesterol-lowering activities (Newman and Cragg, 2012). The remarkable structural and functional diversity of fungal SMs arise from the combinatorial and modular nature of their biosynthesis, in which the SM core backbone is biosynthesized by a core synthase enzyme, such as a polyketide synthase (PKS), a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), or a hybrid PKS-NRPS, and further diversified by a number of tailoring enzymes that are clustered together within the genome (Fischbach and Walsh, 2006). In order to understand the characteristics of microbes residing in the International Space Station (ISS), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has implemented a robust microbial monitoring system (Pierson et al., 2013). The filamentous fungusAspergillus nigerhas been reported to be a predominant ISS isolate (Checinska et al., 2015), and is frequently detected in other built environments (Haleem Khan and Mohan Karuppayil, 2012;Varga et al., 2014).A. nigeris a melanized fungal species commonly used in the biotech industry as a production host for citric acid and enzymes (Schuster et al., 2002). Melanized fungi are commonly isolated from highly irradiated environments (Singaravelan et al., 2008;Selbmann et al., 2015), and it has been reported that the electronic properties of melanin change following exposure to ionizing radiation (Dadachova et al., 2007). Additionally, several studies have reported the association of melanin production with fungal virulence (Kwon-Chung et al., 1982;Wang et al., 1995;Nosanchuk et al., 1998). Together, these findings demonstrate the need for studies that assess the characteristics of melanized fungi inhabiting spacecraft environments. Naphtho-γ-pyrones are the predominant class of SMs produced byA. niger, and they possess a diverse array of reported biological properties, including anti-HIV, anti-hyperuricemia, anti-tubercular, antimicrobial, antitumor, and antioxidant activities (Choque et al., 2015). Advances in genome sequencing ofA. nigerhave revealed its capacity to produce many other SMs in addition to the naphtho-γ-pyrones, as its genome harbors 46 PKSs, 35 NRPSs, and 9 NRPS-PKS hybrid genes (Romsdahl and Wang, 2019). Many of these SM biosynthesis genes are silent or expressed at very low levels in standard laboratory conditions, which has resulted in a lack of studies on SMs that may have useful industrial and therapeutic properties. Given that fungi produce SMs in response to environmental stress, investigations into SM production ofA. nigerstrains isolated from space environments may reveal enhanced production levels of bioactive molecules and provide insight into the mechanisms underlying such adaptations. Here, we report the SM production of JSC-093350089, a previously described strain ofA. nigerisolated from surfaces of the International Space Station (ISS) (Romsdahl et al., 2018). Our analysis revealed that the ISS isolate produces high levels of the antioxidant pyranonigrin A (Miyake et al., 2007), along with other bioactive SMs, such as kotanin, pestalamide B, and naphtho-γ-pyrones, when compared to the experimentally established strain ATCC 1015. To investigate differences between the strains that may explain the increased production of some SMs in JSC-093350089, we conducted a comparative genetic analysis of biosynthesis clusters and regulators of differentially produced SMs. Finally, the UV resistance potential of pyranonigrin A was assessed. Secondary Metabolite Extraction and Analysis JSC-093350089 and ATCC 1015 were cultivated at 28°C on GMM agar plates, starting with 1 × 107spores per Petri dish (D= 10 cm). After 5 days, agar was chopped into small pieces and extracted with 25 ml methanol (MeOH), followed by 25 ml 1:1 MeOH-dichloromethane, each with 1 h of sonication and filtration. The extract was evaporatedin vacuoand re-dissolved in 2 ml of 20% dimethyl sulfoxide in MeOH and a portion (10 μl) was examined by high performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array detection-mass spectroscopy (HPLC-DAD-MS) analysis. HPLC-MS was carried out using a ThermoFinnigan LCQ Advantage ion trap mass spectrometer with a reverse-phase C18 column (3 μm; 2.1 by 100 mm; Alltech Prevail) at a flow rate of 125 μl/min. The solvent gradient for HPLC-DAD-MS was 95% MeCN/H2O (solvent B) in 5% MeCN/H2O (solvent A) both containing 0.05% formic acid, as follows: 0% solvent B from 0 to 5 min, 0 to 100% solvent B from 5 min to 35 min, 100 to 0% solvent B from 40 to 45 min, and re-equilibration with solvent B from 45 to 50 min. Strains and Molecular Manipulations Paired-end Illumina sequence reads, obtained from a previous study (Romsdahl et al., 2018), were trimmed using Trimmomatic v 0.36 (Bolger et al., 2014) and quality was checked using FastQC v 0.11.7 (Andrews, 2010). TheA. nigerATCC 1015 genome and annotation files were downloaded from the FungiDB web portal (Stajich et al., 2012). Trimmed reads were mapped to the ATCC 1015 reference genome using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) software package v 0.7.17 (Li and Durbin, 2009). Mapped read files were further processed using SAMtools v 1.9 (Li et al., 2009) and PCR artifacts were removed using Picard tools MarkDuplicates1. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertions/deletions (INDELs) were identified using GATK v 3.8.7 (McKenna et al., 2010). Sequence reads containing putative INDELs were realigned using GATK’s IndelRealigner and variants within each sample were called using GATK’s Haplotype Caller. GATK’s VariantFiltration was used to filter the resulting Variant Call Format (VCF) file using stringent cutoffs for quality and coverage {SNPs: QD < 2.0, MQ < 40.0, QUAL < 100, FS > 60.0, MQRankSum < −12.5, SOR > 4.0, ReadPosRankSum < −8.0; INDELs: QD < 2.0, FS > 200.0, MQRankSum < −12.5, SOR > 4, InbreedingCoeff < −0.8, ReadPosRankSum < −20.0}, so that only high-quality variants remained. PromPredict was used to predict if any upstream intergenic variants within 1000 bps of the coding sequence (CDS) occurred within the promoter region (Rangannan and Bansal, 2010;Yella et al., 2018). UVC radiation resistance was assessed using JSC-093350089 WT and CW12015. Both strains were cultivated at 28°C on GMM agar plates by seeding 1 × 107spores per Petri dish (D= 10 cm). Spores were collected after 5 days of growth and counted. An equal amount of spores were resuspended in 5 ml of GMM agar and poured onto Petri dishes consisting of 20 ml GMM agar. Mycelia-containing plates were exposed to varying doses of UVC radiation in triplicate using a CL-1000 Ultraviolet Crosslinker (UVP, Inc.).

Analysis of the Potential Gene Clusters Responsible for Production of Pyranonigrin Ain silico Development of an Efficient Gene Targeting System in JSC-093350089 and Identification of the PKS-NRPS Hybrid Responsible for Pyranonigrin A Biosynthesis Identification of Pyranonigrin A Biosynthesis Gene Cluster Putative function of genes within the pyranonigrin A biosynthetic gene cluster and their homologs inPenicillium thymicola. These findings are in contrast to the recent study conducted inP. thymicola, which did not includepyrEin the proposed pyranonigrin A biosynthetic gene cluster (Tang et al., 2018). In this study, heterologous expression of the suspectedpyrcluster and adjacent genes, which includedpyrE, led to production of pyranonigrin A. However,pyrE(orf2) was excluded from the proposed pathway because it was found to not be expressed with the rest of the cluster in pyranonigrin A-producing conditions. Our data indicates thatpyrEis involved in pyranonigrin A biosynthesis, which as an oxidoreductase may be responsible for the final dehydrogenation or hydroxylation step, which were previously proposed to both be carried out bypyrB. This does not exclude the potential involvement ofpyrDin pyranonigrin A biosynthesis, which was found byTang et al. (2018)to be co-regulated withpyrA-pyrCand was suggested to be involved in tetramic acid formation. Genetic Variant Analysis of Clusters Producing SMs That Exhibit Increased Production Levels in JSC-093350089 Genetic variants occurring in selected SM biosynthetic cluster regions in JSC-093350089 relative to ATCC 1015. *Indicates core SM synthase gene (e.g., PKS, PKS-NRPS). Within the kotanin biosynthetic gene cluster, several mutations were observed which may have influenced regulation and/or activity ofktnD, whose specific role in kotanin biosynthesis remains uncharacterized (Gil Girol et al., 2012). One synonymous and two missense SNPs were observed withinktnD, and 3 deletions were observed in thektnDupstream intergenic region 339, 458, and 555 bps away from the 5′ untranslated region (UTR). Notably, the second of these deletions, which featured a loss of 13 bps, was predicted to be within the promoter region (genomic coordinates 23456–23311) using PromPredict, which predicts promoter regions based on DNA duplex stability and has been verified across a broad range of eukaryotic genomes (Rangannan and Bansal, 2010;Yella et al., 2018). Other variations occurring within thektncluster included 3 SNPs within the intron region ofktnA. Many variants were observed within the pestalamide biosynthetic gene cluster, including two missense SNPs withinepaA, whose gene product was proposed to perform the initial reaction in pestalamide biosynthesis (Wang et al., 2018). INDELs were observed within the 3′ UTR ofepaB, and in both the 5′ and 3′ UTR of orf1. Additionally, intergenic INDELs were observed upstream ofepaC, orf1, and orf3, and downstream ofepaA, epaC, and orf2. One synonymous SNP was observed within PKS-encodingalbA, along with a 2 bp insertion in the downstream intergenic region. Genetic Variant Analysis of SM Cluster Regulators Genetic variants occurring in selected SM regulators in JSC-093350089 relative to ATCC 1015. Assessment of the UV Resistance Potential of Pyranonigrin A Percent survival following exposure to varying doses of UVC radiation for JSC-093350089 WT and JSC-093350089pyrA-(CW12005). *P≤ 0.05; **P≤ 0.01. Although the persistence ofA. nigerin spacecraft (Pierson et al., 2013;Checinska et al., 2015) has been well-documented, few studies have investigated how spacecraft conditions alter its SM production. Metabolomic characterization combined with genetic analysis ofA. nigerstrains that have inhabited spacecraft can provide valuable information about SM-based adaptation mechanisms of fungi capable of surviving in such environments. Additionally, despite a substantial effort to map fungal SMs to their biosynthesis genes, most clusters remain unlinked to their final product, which, in many cases, is due to the low production levels of many metabolites. There is therefore significant potential in analyzing SM production in fungal species isolated from various extreme environments, as such conditions may naturally optimize production yields of useful SMs, thereby reducing the cost of laborious laboratory-based optimization. Metabolomic analysis of theA. nigerlaboratory strain and ISS isolate revealed significant differences in SM production levels. This finding is not surprising given the unique stresses associated with spaceflight and the fact that SM production is an evolutionary-derived trait to confer selective advantage in distinct ecological niches (Brakhage, 2013). While a recent study found that growth in ISS conditions is capable of altering SM production inAspergillus nidulans(Romsdahl et al., 2019), the metabolomic changes encountered in JSC-093350089, which are conserved on Earth, are likely the result of a substantial changes at the genomic or epigenomic level, which may have been selected for by pressures associated with ISS conditions, such as microgravity, enhanced radiation, and low nutrient availability. Interestingly, the spaceflight environment appeared to select for a strain that produces enhanced levels of therapeutically relevant SMs, including the antioxidant pyranonigrin A (Miyake et al., 2007), the human cancer cytotoxic agent bicoumanigrin A (Hiort et al., 2004), the antimicrobial aurasperone A (Shaaban et al., 2012), and the antifungal and antioxidant aurasperone B (Choque et al., 2015). Perhaps the most significant observation was enhanced production of pyranonigrin A in JSC-093350089 relative to ATCC 1015, which only produces the SM at basal levels. On the ISS, radiation capable of penetrating the spacecraft generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) within biological systems (Gabani and Singh, 2013). Oxidative stress occurs when ROS overwhelm an organism’s antioxidant defense mechanisms, resulting in the generation of oxidative damage among DNA, proteins, lipids, and other vital cell components (Lehnert and Iyer, 2002;Gabani and Singh, 2013). Antioxidants have enormous therapeutic potential, as they neutralize the harmful effects of ROS, which can cause or exacerbate a range of human diseases, including cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative diseases (Firuzi et al., 2011). Examination of metabolic reserves of fungi isolated from enhanced radiation environments therefore provides a means of identifying fungal strains that produce optimized levels of specific therapeutics, as illustrated by this study. Further, investigation into the underlying genetics that may be responsible for increased production of bioactive compounds provides a useful starting point for future production yield optimization efforts. Second only to pyranonigrin A, kotanin exhibited a 10-fold increase in production levels in JSC-093350089. Within its biosynthetic gene cluster, mutations were observed withinktnDthat could have altered both its regulation and activity, including a 13 bp deletion within the promoter region and 2 missense mutations. It is unclear whether altered regulation ofktnDcould explain the increase in kotanin production levels, as the specific role of KtnD, a monooxygenase, in the biosynthesis of kotanin has not been determined, and KtnS was proposed to be the rate-limiting step in the pathway (Gil Girol et al., 2012). Within the pestalamide biosynthetic cluster, several mutations were observed which may explain its twofold increase in production in the ISS strain. Two missense mutations were observed within the gene encoding EpaA, the NR-PKS proposed to perform the initial reaction in pestalamide biosynthesis. Notably, INDELs were observed within the 5′ UTR and 3′ UTR of orf1. UTRs often contain regulatory elements that play key roles in appropriate expression of a gene, and therefore the observed variation may be responsible for altered regulatory patterns of orf1, which encodes for an oxidoreductase. The gene product of orf1, also known as AzaJ, is also involved in the biosynthesis of the azanigerones, which are produced by the same cluster as the pestalamides (Zabala et al., 2012). In azanigerone biosynthesis, AzaJ is proposed to catalyze the oxidation of an aldehyde to a carboxylic acid, partially facilitating the transformation of azanigerone C to azanigerone A. In pestalamide biosynthesis, AzaJ was proposed to be involved in the generation of the intermediate carbonarone A from the polyketide precursor, which involves oxidation and transamination (Wang et al., 2018). Further studies need to be performed to determine if this step in the pathway is rate-limiting, and if altered expression ofazaJcould be responsible for the increase in pestalamide production levels. Another potentially significant mutation that we observed was an insertion in the 3′ UTR ofepaB, which encodes an acyl:CoA ligase that may catalyze the formation of 2-methylsuccinyl-CoA, as it plays a similar role in the azanigerone pathway. 2-methylsuccinyl-CoA is then used as a substrate by EpaC followed by cyclization to form pestalamide. Further experiments should be performed to confirm whether the observed 3′ UTR variant alters expression levels ofepaB, which then leads to altered pestalamide production levels. Next, we investigated genetic variants associated with genes encoding known regulators of pestalamide, including the pathway-specific transcription factor AzaR and the epigenetic regulator GcnE (Zabala et al., 2012;Wang et al., 2018). However, this analysis did not reveal any substantial findings; while both genes possess upstream intergenic variants in JSC-093350089, they were predicted to outside the promoter region. It is reasonable to presume that enhanced production of molecules that confer oxidative stress resistance is a key adaptive characteristic of fungi inhabiting high-radiation environments, as this has been observed among other species (Baqai et al., 2009;Robinson et al., 2011). This may explain the enhanced production levels of pyranonigrin A in the ISS isolate, and is supported by the UV resistance study, which suggests that pyranonigrin A plays a role in conferring radiation resistance inA. niger. Additionally, we observed a cumulative increase in the production of naphtho-γ-pyrones, which are produced by AlbA, the same PKS responsible for 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene-melanin (DHN-melanin) biosynthesis. This stays in agreement with the observed enrichment of AlbA in the proteome of JSC-093350089 relative to ATCC 1015 (Romsdahl et al., 2018). Such observations suggest that the ISS isolate produces enhanced levels of DHN-melanin, and is consistent with previous reports that fungi inhabiting high-radiation environments produce enhanced levels of melanin (Singaravelan et al., 2008). In microbial systems, melanin functions as a UV-protectant, an antioxidant, a thermoregulator, and as a toxin-sequestering agent (Cordero and Casadevall, 2017). It is therefore reasonable to presume that increased melanin production may be an adaptive feature that is selected for by spaceflight environments. We were unable to identify any mutations associated withalbAthat may explain its upregulation and the associated increase in naphtho-γ-pyrone production. Additionally, we could not investigate variants occurring in naphtho-γ-pyrone tailoring enzymes, as those genes are not clustered withalbAand have not yet been characterized. Further, as discussed before with regard to the pestalamides, while production levels of naphtho-γ-pyrones were reported to increase following deletion of the epigenetic regulatorgcnE, we did not identify any mutations associated withgcnEthat may explain increased production levels of naphtho-γ-pyrones. In summary, this investigation revealed the distinct metabolomic fingerprint of a melanized fungal species capable of withstanding ISS conditions, which featured enhanced production of a molecule with antioxidant and UV-protective properties. Genetic analysis revealed variants that may be responsible for the observed increase in SM production levels. These findings illustrate the therapeutic and economic potential associated with investigating metabolite production in microbes isolated from extreme environments and provide a framework for future efforts to genetically optimize production yields of the bioactive SMs described in this study.
