The reactive oxygen species wave propagates through vascular bundles during the systemic response of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants to excess light stress. Systemic signaling and systemic acquired acclimation (SAA) are essential for plant survival during episodes of environmental stress. Recent studies highlighted a key role for reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling in mediating systemic responses and SAA during light stress in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana).These studies further identified the RESPIRATORY BURST OXIDASE HOMOLOG D (RBOHD) protein as a key player in mediating rapid systemic ROS responses. Here, we report that tissue-specific expression of RBOHD in phloem or xylem parenchyma cells of therbohDmutant restores systemic ROS signaling, systemic stress-response transcript expression, and SAA to a local treatment of light stress. We further demonstrate thatRBOHDandRBOHFare both required for local and systemic ROS signaling at the vascular bundles of Arabidopsis. Taken together, our findings highlight a key role for RBOHD-driven ROS production at the vascular bundles of Arabidopsis in mediating light stress–induced systemic signaling and SAA. In addition, they suggest that the integration of ROS, calcium, electric, and hydraulic signals, during systemic signaling, occurs at the vascular bundles. Plants and other multicellular organisms are able to transmit different chemical and physical signals over long distances, sometimes traversing their entire length. These signals coordinate the response of the entire organism to different stresses, pathogens, and/or other stimuli and are thought to play a key role in the acclimation, defense, and adaptation of different organisms to their environment (Choi et al., 2017;Takahashi et al., 2018;Kollist et al., 2019;Wang et al., 2019;Fichman and Mittler, 2020). In plants, a plethora of chemical and physical signals are transmitted from a single leaf or root tip subjected to stress (i.e., a local tissue) to the entire plant (i.e., systemic tissues). These signals, collectively termed systemic signals, include different chemicals and volatiles, such as salicylic acid, abscisic acid (ABA), and methyl jasmonate, as well as small peptides, and physical signals such as electric signals and hydraulic waves (Galvez-Valdivieso et al., 2009;Szechyńska-Hebda et al., 2010;Devireddy et al., 2018;Nguyen et al., 2018;Toyota et al., 2018;Takahashi et al., 2018;Wang et al., 2019). In recent years, a role for two interlinked signal transduction molecules, that is, Ca2+and reactive oxygen species (ROS), was identified in the systemic response of plants to different abiotic stimuli such as excess light stress or wounding. These two signals were further shown to propagate from cell to cell over long distances in plants and were termed the Ca2+and ROS waves (Miller et al., 2009;Choi et al., 2014;Toyota et al., 2018;Zandalinas and Mittler, 2018;Fichman et al., 2019;Fichman and Mittler, 2020). The ROS wave is essential for coordinating systemic metabolic responses that generate different metabolic signatures in different parts of the plant (Choudhury et al., 2018); for coordinating systemic transcriptomic responses that activate transcriptional networks essential for plant acclimation (Zandalinas et al., 2019); and for coordinating systemic physiological responses, such as changes in stomatal aperture (Devireddy et al., 2018,2020). In addition, the ROS wave is required for successful plant acclimation to light and heat stresses (Suzuki et al., 2013;Devireddy et al., 2018;Zandalinas et al., 2019,2020). The initiation, propagation, and maintenance of the ROS wave in response to abiotic stress is dependent on the plasma membrane–localized RESPIRATORY BURST OXIDASE HOMOLOG D (RBOHD; AT5G47910) protein (Miller et al., 2009;Zandalinas and Mittler, 2018;Fichman and Mittler, 2020). However, genetic evidence in the form of complementation studies, as well as cell biology studies elucidating the role of RBOHD in different plant tissues during systemic signaling, has thus far been lacking. RBOHD belongs to a family of 10 different proteins in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), able to produce superoxide radicals at the apoplast in response to a cytosolic calcium and/or phosphorylation signal (Suzuki et al., 2011;Kadota et al., 2015;Fichman and Mittler, 2020). The superoxide radicals generated at the apoplast by RBOH proteins are dismutated spontaneously, or via superoxide dismutases present in the apoplast, to generate H2O2that can enter cells via aquaporins (Mittler et al., 2011;Gilroy et al., 2016;Choi et al., 2017;Mittler, 2017;Rodrigues et al., 2017;Clemente‐Moreno et al., 2019;Fichman and Mittler, 2020;García et al., 2020). Of the 10 RBOHs in Arabidopsis, RBOHD and RBOHF (AT1G64060) are the two primarily expressed in aboveground vegetative tissues (Torres et al., 2002;Kwak et al., 2003;Morales et al., 2016). Based on their relative speed, as well as their physical and chemical properties, four different systemic signals are thought to copropagate, or at least interact with each other, during rapid systemic signaling in plants. These include the ROS, Ca2+, hydraulic, and electric waves (Mittler et al., 2011;Gilroy et al., 2016;Choi et al., 2017;Fichman and Mittler, 2020). Calcium waves and electrical signals are dependent on the function of the calcium-permeable glutamate receptor-like (GLR) GLR3.3 and GLR3.6 channels (Mousavi et al., 2013;Nguyen et al., 2018;Toyota et al., 2018;Wudick et al., 2018;Shao et al., 2020), and calcium and ROS waves were proposed to be linked through the function of RBOHD (Mittler et al., 2011;Evans et al., 2016). RBOHD was further shown to be required for the propagation of certain electric signals in response to light stress (Suzuki et al., 2013). Although it is unknown how hydraulic waves are linked to electric, ROS, and calcium waves, it was proposed that different mechanosensitive channels (Basu and Haswell, 2017) could sense hydraulic waves at systemic tissues and convert them into calcium signals (Choi et al., 2017;Kollist et al., 2019;Fichman and Mittler, 2020). Calcium signals can further influence ROS signals via the function of different calcium binding proteins and kinases/phosphatase molecular switches or by directly binding to the E and F helices (EF)-hand domains of RBOHD (Suzuki et al., 2011;Kadota et al., 2015;Fichman and Mittler, 2020). Although the Ca2+, hydraulic, and electric waves were recently shown to propagate through the vascular bundles of plants, utilizing plant tissues such as phloem, xylem parenchyma, and bundle sheath cells (Mousavi et al., 2013;Sade et al., 2014;Nguyen et al., 2018;Toyota et al., 2018;Shao et al., 2020), the cell types and tissues through which the ROS wave propagates in plants are currently unknown (Fichman and Mittler, 2020;Fichman et al., 2020).

Complementation of Light Stress–Induced SAA in therbohDMutant withRBOHDDriven by Different Tissue-Specific Promoters. Light stress–induced systemic leaf cell injury (measured as electrolyte leakage) of the wild type (Columbia-0 [Col]),rbohD, and the differentrbohDcomplemented Arabidopsis plants was determined. Systemic leaves were either untreated, nonpretreated, and unstressed (untreated, unstressed) or subjected to light stress following a pretreatment of one local leaf with light stress (pretreated, stressed). SAA is evident by a low level of electrolyte leakage in light-stressed systemic leaves (pretreated, stressed), which is similar to that of untreated and unstressed leaves (untreated, unstressed). Ten different plants each from two independent complemented lines for each construct (nos. 1 and 2) were subjected to light stress, and cell injury was measured in systemic leaves by electrolyte leakage.

A key role for bundle sheath cells in mediating excess light stress–induced systemic responses was previously reported in Arabidopsis, highlighting veins as important hubs for ABA and ROS signaling (Galvez-Valdivieso et al., 2009;Kangasjärvi et al., 2009;Fichman and Mittler, 2020). In support of this role, as well as the findings described in our current study (Figures 1to5), are our previous findings that systemic stomatal aperture closure responses occur faster the closer stomata are to leaf veins (Devireddy et al., 2020). The expression ofRBOHDin vascular bundles may therefore drive ROS signaling in these cells, affecting the stomata closest to them first, during the systemic response to light stress (Devireddy et al., 2020). This spatial relationship could further be explained by an interaction between ABA signaling and ROS production occurring at the vascular bundles (Galvez-Valdivieso et al., 2009;Kangasjärvi et al., 2009;Devireddy et al., 2018,2020). Interestingly, although bundle sheath cells were shown to play a key role in systemic ABA and ROS signaling in response to abiotic stress (Galvez-Valdivieso et al., 2009;Kangasjärvi et al., 2009), they were not found by our analysis to be essential for mediating the systemic ROS wave response (Figures 1to3). This finding could suggest that the role of bundle sheath cells in mediating systemic signaling is linked in Arabidopsis to that of phloem and/or xylem parenchyma cells and that these different cell layers could cooperate in the systemic response of plants to stress. Phloem and/or xylem parenchyma cells could therefore mediate the ROS wave, while bundle sheath cells could integrate it with ABA signaling. Taken together, our findings reveal that in addition to Ca2+, electric, and hydraulic signals (Mousavi et al., 2013;Sade et al., 2014;Toyota et al., 2018;Shao et al., 2020), ROS signals are also mediated through the plant vascular system. The potential integration of all these rapid systemic signals (Gilroy et al., 2016;Choi et al., 2017;Fichman and Mittler, 2020;Fichman et al., 2020) could therefore occur at the vascular bundles of plants, underscoring the importance of these tissues in mediating plant acclimation to different abiotic stresses and other stimuli. Vascular bundles could therefore serve as the central rapid systemic signaling super highway of plants. Plant Material, Growth Conditions, and Constructs Light Stress, ROS, Luciferase and GFP Imaging, and Data Analysis Systemic Acquired Acclimation Assays A single leaf was pretreated for 15 min with a light intensity of 1700 µmol m−2s−1. Plants were then incubated for 45 min under controlled conditions. Following the recovery period, a systemic leaf was exposed to a light intensity of 1700 µmol m−2s−1for 45 min. Systemic leaves were then analyzed for electrolyte leakage as described bySuzuki et al. (2013),Devireddy et al. (2018), andZandalinas et al. (2019,2020). Control plants were untreated (Suzuki et al., 2013;Devireddy et al., 2018;Zandalinas et al., 2019,2020).
