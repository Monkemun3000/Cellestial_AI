  "content": "Single-cell multi-ome and immune profiles of the Inspiration4 crew reveal conserved, cell-type, and sex-specific responses to spaceflight Received 2024 Jan 17; Accepted 2024 May 28; Collection date 2024. Spaceflight induces an immune response in astronauts. To better characterize this effect, we generated single-cell, multi-ome, cell-free RNA (cfRNA), biochemical, and hematology data for the SpaceX Inspiration4 (I4) mission crew. We found that 18 cytokines/chemokines related to inflammation, aging, and muscle homeostasis changed after spaceflight. In I4 single-cell multi-omics data, we identified a “spaceflight signature” of gene expression characterized by enrichment in oxidative phosphorylation, UV response, immune function, and TCF21 pathways. We confirmed the presence of this signature in independent datasets, including the NASA Twins Study, the I4 skin spatial transcriptomics, and 817 NASA GeneLab mouse transcriptomes. Finally, we observed that (1) T cells showed an up-regulation of FOXP3, (2) MHC class I genes exhibited long-term suppression, and (3) infection-related immune pathways were associated with microbiome shifts. In summary, this study reveals conserved and distinct immune disruptions occurring and details a roadmap for potential countermeasures to preserve astronaut health. Subject terms:Epigenomics, Immunogenetics Multiple omics platforms and deep single-cell profiling in the I4 astronauts reveal both conserved and distinct immune system disruptions across missions, provide a single-cell immune reference for future missions. Immune-related clinical symptoms from spaceflight are prevalent among astronauts and span many phenotypes, including inflammation, infection, and viral reactivation5,6. Indeed, clinical symptoms associated with immune dysregulation were reported with 3.4 events per flight year, representing 46% of crew members6. While these findings show that the spaceflight environment affects the human immune system, they do not reveal the underlying pathways and mechanisms therein, underscoring the need for further studies. Also, since spaceflight phenocopies many of the effects of aging and aging-related disease (e.g., bone density and muscle loss)7, a better characterization of immune system changes during the extreme physiological stressor of spaceflight can offer insights into immune dysregulation and functional deterioration on Earth. Multi-omic studies provide unique advantages for understanding biological changes, including spaceflight-associated immune system alterations. For example, the NASA Twins Study used gene expression to investigate immune changes stemming from a year-long mission, and found unprecedented levels of cytokines like IL-6 and IL-10, and gene expression changes in both B-cells and T-cells7–9. However, a major limitation of that study was the sample size, as it involved only one flight subject. It additionally used a bulk-cell analysis for most of the transcriptome (preventing observations at a single-cell resolution) and lacked a chromatin analysis using assays for transposase-accessible chromatin accessibility (ATAC) data8,9, which is critical for understanding changes in genome regulation and long-term stress response.

For each cell type, we ranked genes with non-zero LASSO coefficients first by the number of Bonferroni < 0.2 findings then by the total number of nominally associated (pvalue < 0.05) microbial features (bacteria or viruses). We report up to ten human genes per sub-panel. Source data are provided through the github link. While promising in terms of cellular recovery profiles, the I4 mission was not designed to determine the safety of spaceflight for all civilians, nor should these data alone be used to make judgments for future crew selection, number, age, sex, or fitness for spaceflight. Moreover, some functions of chromatin accessibility or gene regulation differences are inferred (e.g., chromVAR), and will need additional characterization in future studies. Nonetheless, the molecular measures from the I4 crew enabled new comparisons to prior missions (e.g., the NASA Twins Study, NASA JSC data, JAXA cfRNA) and meta-analysis of the space-flown mouse studies (817 samples across 27 datasets encompassing 10 different mouse tissues), which mostly confirmed our observations for the significantly altered pathways. Overall, a rapid gene and chromatin recovery was seen for the crew across most cell types, save for the CD14 monocytes and 16 monocytes, and these data can serve as additional baseline biomedical data and context for future missions. Repeated measures of pre- and post-flight metrics of crews will enable better contextualization and statistical rigor by researchers and clinicians and enable guidance for how astronauts can serve as their own controls (within-subjects design) by using their pre-flight immune marker levels as a reference. In conclusion, these convergent signatures of spaceflight begin to detail the core, consistent set of human cellular and molecular responses to spaceflight and can help narrow the targets for countermeasures and monitoring in future studies. Moreover, any potential long-term changes need to be monitored longitudinally to scan for any reversion or exacerbation of the phenotypes before pharmacological or biomedical interventions can be considered. Exploring the data introduced here is enabled through our interactive data portal (https://soma.weill.cornell.edu) and downloadable through public and controlled-access repositories (NASA Open Science Data Repositories and GeneLab/ALSDA). In the coming years, NASA plans to put the first woman and first person of color on the Moon, and such ambitious missions can leverage the data shown here, which details cell-, person-, and sex-specific molecular data, thus guiding more precise risk mitigation, crew health monitoring, and long-term countermeasure development. IRB statement human subjects research All subjects were consented at an informed consent briefing at SpaceX (Hawthorne, CA), and samples were collected and processed under the approval of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Weill Cornell Medicine, under Protocol 21-05023569. All crew members have consented to data and sample sharing. Tissue samples were provided by SpaceX Inspiration4 crew members after consent for research use of the biopsies, swabs, and biological materials. The procedure followed guidelines set by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and operated under IRB-approved protocols. Experiments were conducted in accordance with local regulations and with the approval of the IRB at Weill Cornell Medicine (IRB #21-05023569). PBMC isolation and single-cell library preparation For each crew member, 8 mL of venous blood was collected in EDTA anticoagulant tubes. Depletion of granulocytes was performed either directly from whole blood using the RosetteSepTM granulocyte depletion cocktail or by cell sorting after PBMC isolation. Whole blood was incubated in a granulocyte depletion cocktail (50 µL/mL of blood) for 20 min at room temperature. Next, Ficoll-Paque Plus (Cytiva) was utilized to isolate PBMCs by density gradient centrifugation. After washes in PBS with 2% FBS (GIBCO) were completed, isolated PBMCs were cell sorted to remove granulocytes only if the RosetteSepTM granulocyte depletion cocktail was not added to whole blood prior to density gradient centrifugation. Granulocytes were identified using side scatter and the lymphocyte and monocyte fractions were sorted using a 100 µm nozzle (BD Aria). Following granulocyte depletion, PBMCs were split into two fractions to generate single cell V(D)J T-cell and B-cell libraries or multiomic (GEX and ATAC) libraries. To capture T-cell and B-cell V(D)J repertoire, single cell gel beads-in-emulsion and libraries were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 5′ v2, 10X Genomics). Prior to single cell multiome ATAC and gene expression sequencing, nuclei isolation was performed by resuspending PBMCs in 100 µL of cold lysis buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Tween-20, 0.1% Nonidet P40, 0.01% digitonin, 1% BSA, 1 mM DTT and 1 U/µL RNAse inhibitor. Cells were incubated for 4 min on ice, followed by the addition of 1 mL cold wash buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Tween-20, 1% BSA, 0.1% Tween-20, 1 mM DTT, 1 U/µL RNAse inhibitor). After centrifugation (500 ×gfor 5 min at 4 °C), nuclei were resuspended in a diluted nuclei buffer (10X Genomics Single Cell Multiome ATAC kit A) at a concentration of 6000 nuclei per µL. Single-cell libraries were generated via the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell Multiome ATAC and Gene Expression kit (10X Genomics) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In total, six timepoints were sequenced, including 92 days pre-flight (June), 44 days pre-flight (August), pre-flight (Pre-September), post-flight (Post-September), 45 days post-flight (November), 82 days post-flight (December). The libraries sequenced for each timepoint included ATAC, GEX, and VDJ (TCR + BCR) libraries. Four libraries corresponding to the four astronauts were prepared for each timepoint and library type, except for the June and August timepoints for which VDJ libraries were not prepared. In total, there were 24 ATAC and GEX libraries and 32 VDJ libraries, which were sequenced in three batches. The concentration of each library was taken using the Invitrogen Qubit 1X dsDNA HS Assay Kit and run on Agilent Tapestation 2100 using Agilent Technologies D1000 reagents and Screentape for fragment analysis. The nanomolarity of each sample was calculated using the formula ((concentration (ng/µl)/ (660 g/mol)* fragment size (bp))*10^6. After the nanomolarity was obtained for each sample, the target nanomolarity was determined using the lowest nanomolarity of the sample libraries. The desired number of reads per sample was determined based on the following criterion: 35,000 read pairs per cell for ATAC libraries, 25,000 read pairs per cell for GEX libraries, and 5000 read pairs per cell for VDJ libraries. Following this, the total number of reads per pool of samples was determined by adding all the read pairs per sample, and the percentage of total read pairs of each pool that is made up of each sample was determined using this formula (desired read pairs for sample/total read pairs for the pool) × 100. The target volume (µL) for each pool was determined based on requirements for sequencing, final molarity, etc. In this case, 200 µL was used for the ATAC library pool, and 100 µL was used for both the VDJ and GEX library pools. The target volume (µL) for each sample was then calculated based on the percentage of the total pool calculated earlier, using the desired final pool volume. Based on the target nanomolarity, sample nanomolarity, and sample target volume, the input volume (uL) for each sample was calculated using the following formula ((target nanomolarity * sample target volume)/sample nanomolarity). If the volume of each individual sample does not meet the target sample volume the rest of the volume can be made up using nuclease-free water. The total volume of both the samples and nuclease-free water should add up to the target pool volume. Following these pooling protocols, the samples were sequenced on the NovaSeq 6000 sequencing system. Processing of single-cell data To identify putative cell types, Azimuth (version 0.3.2) pipeline was used with the reference dataset of Human. We annotated PBMCs subpopulations by supervised analysis guided by the Azimuth PBMC reference generated from single-cell transcriptome and CITE-seq71. For cellular proportion comparison after spaceflight, a p-value less than 0.05 with Wilcoxon rank sum test is considered significant. Differentially expressed genes and differentially accessible regions were identified with the FindMarkers function in Seurat (v4.2.0) packages (|log2FC | > 0.25 and padj < 0.05 with the default setting for other parameters). FindMotifs function in Seurat packages with default settings was used to identify the enriched transcription factor based on DARs. By running chromVAR, we computed a per-cell motif activity score (chromVAR deviation z-score of TF motifs) to visualize motif activities per cell. GeneActivity function in Signac package with default settings was used to quantify gene activity from ATAC, which generate a rough estimate of the transcriptional activity of each gene by quantifying ATAC-seq counts in the 2 kb-upstream region and gene body. AddModuleScore function in Seurat package with default setting was used to calculate the average expression levels of each program (cluster) on single cell level, subtracted by the aggregated expression of control feature sets. TCR and BCR-aligned data were analyzed with the VGenes package (https://github.com/WilsonImmunologyLab/VGenes). Biochemical profiling (BCP) and complete blood count (CBC) Complete blood count (CBC) and comprehensive metabolic panels were completed by Quest Diagnostics. One 4 mL tube of whole blood collected in a K2 EDTA tube was used for the CBC, test code 6399. 500 µL of serum from a serum separator tube (SST) was submitted for the comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), test code 10231. Serum samples were submitted to Eve Technologies for the biomarker profiling panels (1) Human Cytokine/Chemokine 71-Plex Discovery Assay® Array (HD71) and (2) Human Cardiovascular Disease Panel 3 9-Plex Discovery Assay® Array (HDCVD9). Concentration values were extrapolated using a four of five parameter logic standard curve. Samples were normalized by the mean of the preflight value of each crew. For BCP and CBC, apvalue less than 0.05 with the Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test is considered significant. We analyzed the previously reported astronaut BCPs57by further delineating the effect of sex- and time by Two-way ANOVA with a post hoc Bonferroni t-test. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of immune cells Reverse transcription and quantitative PCR (qPCR) FACS-isolated T cells were used for RNA extraction with RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, cat no.74134). cDNA was synthesized with SuperScript™ III First-Strand Synthesis System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat no. 18080051).

A meta-analysis of the GeneLab data was performed in two steps. Firstly, we performed batch correction using Combat-seq73to standardize data across different datasets. Subsequently, DESeq274was used to perform differential expression analysis between the spaceflight and ground control mice while adjusting for age, sex, tissue, sacrifice site, and mission duration. The meta-analysis was done using DeSeq2 (wald test, two-tailed) based on batch(study)-corrected count matrix calculated with combat-seq. Multiple testing adjustment was done using Benjamini-hochberg. This analysis resulted in a ‘spaceflight signature in mice’ consisting of 2184 differentially expressed genes (1288 up-regulated and 896 down-regulated). To visually confirm that the genes in the spaceflight signature were changing in a similar direction across datasets based on differential expression analysis on each dataset separately grouping by tissue, sex, age, and mission duration. Prcomp function of R was used to calculate principal components from gene expression and peak expression profiles. ssGSEA package was used to calculate the normalized enrichment score with MSigDB pathways.

Here is an example of the pre-ranked GSEA pipeline we performed. (a). Prepare the pathway collection In our case, we used MSigDB, “spaceflight signature of mice”, or DEGs from the selected study (b). Prepare the ranked list of genes. We ranked the gene sets by the adjustedpvalue, a combination of log2FC multiplied by −log10 (adjustedpvalue (orpvalue)), or stat. There are several ways to rank the gene sets by correlation,pvalue, adjustedpvalue, log2FC, stat, or combination of log2FC and adjustedpvalue (orpvalue) derived from the differential expression analysis. (c). Run GSEA gProfiler (https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/) was used to identify significantly enriched (padj < 0.05) GO or KEGG pathways. All DEGs, up-regulated DEGs, downregulated DEGs, microbiome-associated DEGs were used as input. Data were analyzed through the use of Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, version 01-22-01) (QIAGEN Inc.) software with DEGs, FDR < 0.05. Common DEGs between females and males and sex-specific DEGs were used for canonical pathways. Gene and pathway overlap analysis I4 and GeneLab mouse data comparison To compare the spaceflight signature in mice against the gene expression changes in Inspiration 4, we mapped the mouse genes to their human equivalent using Ensembl Biomart75, which resulted in 1942 human orthologues (1147 upregulated and 795 downregulated). These human orthologues were then compared against differentially expressed (padj < 0.05) in I4. To calculate the significance of the overlap we used Fisher’s exact test implemented in the R package GeneOverlap (https://github.com/shenlab-sinai/GeneOverlap).Pvalues for the overlaps were adjusted by multiple tests using Benjamini-Hochberg method76. We found that 80% of the comparisons in level 1 cell annotation were statistically significant, while 56% were significant in level 2 annotation. Notably, all comparisons involving down-regulated genes in the spaceflight signature in mice and I4 showed statistical significance. None of the comparisons between down-regulated gene sets in Inspiration 4 against up-regulated genes in the spaceflight signature in mice (and vice versa) yielded statistical significance in either level 1 or 2 cell annotations. By GSEA, ranking the genes from the GeneLab meta-analysis by the negative logarithm of the p-value multiplied by the sign of the fold change (i.e., 1 if positive, −1 if negative) and evaluating whether genes differentially expressed in each cell type in I4 were enriched in either direction of the ranked ordered list. For this calculation, we used the R package fgsea77. I4 skin spatial transcriptomics Metagenomics and metatranscriptomics DNA/RNA isolation, sequencing, and analysis We used two approaches to identify associations between differentially expressed human genes and bacteria/viruses. First, we used Lasso regression to identify relationships between all DEGs for a given cell type and microbial features, characterizing any non-zero Lasso coefficient as a “potential association.” We use this phrasing because Lasso regression does not implicitly include statistical inference, therefore not controlling for false positive rates. We fit models of the form: We fit different models for bacteria and viruses (e.g., for one model, microbe1..xwould be all bacteria, for another it would be all viruses). Prior to regressing, we centered and scaled the human gene abundances. We computed lasso models with both log transformed microbial abundances as well as Center-Log-Ratio transformed abundances, adding a pseudocount in the form of the smallest abundance value for a given matrix beforehand in both cases. As a second form of association identification with the added benefit of statistical inference to control for false positives, we used a mixed effect linear regression approach for each microbe/DEG pair that had a non-zero coefficient coming out of the Lasso regressions. We transformed the gene/microbe abundances with the same approaches as above and fit models of the form: Plasma was frozen at −80 °C until processed. Before RNA extraction, plasma samples were thawed at room temperature and subsequently centrifuged at 1300 ×gfor 10 min at 4 °C. cfRNA was isolated from the plasma supernatant (300–800 µL) using the Norgen Plasma/Serum Circulating and Exosomal RNA Purification Mini Kit (Catalog No. 51000, Norgen). Next, 10 mL of DNase Turbo Buffer (Catalog No. AM2238, Invitrogen), 3 mL of DNase Turbo (Catalog No. AM2238, Invitrogen), and 1 mL of Baseline Zero DNase (Catalog No. DB0715K, Lucigen-Epicenter) was added to the extracted RNA and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, the treated RNA was concentrated into a final volume of 12 mL with the Zymo RNA Clean and Concentrate Kit (Catalog No. R1015, Zymo). Sequencing libraries prepared from 8 μL of concentrated RNA using the Takara SMARTer Stranded Total RNA-Seq Kit v3—Pico Input Mammalian (634485, Takara) and barcoded using the SMARTer RNA Unique Dual Index Kit (634451, Takara). Library concentration was quantified using a Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Q33216, Invitrogen) with the dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Q32854, Invitrogen). Libraries were quality-controlled using an Agilent Fragment Analyzer 5200 (M5310AA, Agilent) with the HS NGS Fragment kit (DNF-474-0500, Agilent). Libraries were pooled to equal concentrations and sequenced at Cornell Genomics on an Illumina NextSeq 2000 machine using 150-base pair, paired-end sequencing for an average of 26 million reads per sample. Sequencing data was processed using a custom bioinformatics pipeline utilizing the Snakemake workflow management system (v7.7.0). Reads were quality filtered and trimmed using BBDUK (v38.90), aligned to the Gencode GRCh38 human reference genome (v38, primary assembly) using STAR (v2.7.0f) default parameters, deduplicated using UMI tools (v1.1.2), and features quantified using featureCount (v2.0.0). Mitochondrial, ribosomal, X, and Y chromosome genes were removed prior to analysis. cfRNA sample quality was determined by calculating DNA contamination (intron/exon ratio), rRNA contamination, number of feature counts, and RNA degradation. All samples passed QC. Read counts of technical duplicate samples were combined for downstream analyses. Cell-type deconvolution was performed using BayesPrism (v2.0) with the Tabula Sapiens single cell RNA-seq atlas (Release 1)83,84. Cells from the Tabula Sapiens atlas were grouped as previously described in ref.85. Comparative analysis of DEGs was performed using a negative binomial model as implemented in the DESeq2 package (v1.34.0) using a Benjamini-Hochberg correctedpvalue cutoff < 0.05, unless otherwise stated. Variance stabilization transformation was used for comparing and plotting gene counts, unless otherwise stated. Plasma samples were centrifuged at 12,000 ×gfor 20 min and then Extracellular Vesicles and Particles (EVPs) were collected by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 ×gfor 70 min. EVPs were then washed in PBS and again collected by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 ×gfor 70 min. The final EVP pellet was resuspended in PBS. Two micrograms of enriched EVPs were digested and analyzed with LC-MS/MS in data-dependent acquisition mode. The list of differentially abundant proteins from the plasma proteomics data was filtered for differentially expressed genes that had an adjustedpvalue < 0.05 and |logFC | > 1. Heatmaps were generated with mitochondrial and oxidative stress genes using R package pheatmap. Additional protocol details on EVP proteomic profiling is described in ref.86. Gene set enrichment analysis and gene expression data have been downloaded from the previous publication7. In brief, one astronaut was monitored before, during, and after a 1-year mission onboard the ISS, and his identical twin sibling was also monitored at the same time, serving as a genetically matched ground control for this study. Plasma cell-free RNA differential expression data and study protocols were shared through NASA’s GeneLab platform with accession number GLDS-530/OSD-530. Briefly, blood samples were collected from 6 astronauts before, during, and after the spaceflight on the ISS. Total RNA was purified from plasma samples and processed for RNA-seq analysis. Mean expression values were obtained from normalized read counts of 6 astronauts for each time point. Single-cell microgravity simulated in vitro PBMCs Bulk RNA-sequencing from mouse tissues FDA-approved drugs (n= 1692) are selected from the DrugBank database and food compounds (n= 7962) are selected from the FoodDB database. LINCS compounds (n= 5414) are obtained from LINCS L1000 project. “Compound” is used as a general term for “drug”, “food compound” and “LINCS compound” throughout the document. Compound-protein interactions are extracted from the STITCH database v5.069 by matching the InChI keys of drugs/food/LINCS compounds. STITCH collects information from multiple sources and individual scores from each source are combined into an overall confidence score. After processing, three data sets are obtained: i) drug-gene interaction dataset containing 1890 drugs and 16,654 genes with 542,577 interactions ii) food compound - gene interaction dataset containing 7,654 compounds and 116,375 genes and 818,737 interactions iii) LINCS compound—gene interaction dataset containing 5414 compounds and 16,794 genes and 692,152 interactions. The universal gene set contains all genes that interact with at least one compound. The compound with low p-value interacts with a higher proportion of the DEGs than that expected by chance. Statistically significant compounds were then obtained after Bonferroni adjustment ofpvalues. The pipeline for this compound analysis is implemented in the gcea R package (https://github.com/nguyenkhiemv/gcea).
