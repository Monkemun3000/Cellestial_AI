The development of eye pathology is a serious concern for astronauts who spend time in deep space. Microgravity is a major component of the spaceflight environment which could have adverse effects on ocular health. The use of centrifugation to exert forces that partially or fully mimic Earth-level gravity in space is a possible countermeasure to mitigate the effects of microgravity on the eye. Therefore, we subjected mice on the International Space Station (ISS) to microgravity (0 G) or artificial gravity by centrifugation at 0.33 G, 0.67 G, and 1 G, and then performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on optic nerve and retinal tissue after returning them to Earth alive. We find that the microgravity environment induces transcriptomic changes in the optic nerve and retina consistent with an increased oxidative stress load, inflammation, apoptosis, and lipid metabolic stress. We also find that adding artificial gravity on board the ISS attenuates the transcriptomic response to microgravity in a dose-dependent manner. Such attenuation may effectively protect from and mitigate spaceflight-induced detrimental effects on ocular tissue. Physiological and pathological neuro-ophthalmic abnormalities have been observed in astronauts that have undergone prolonged spaceflight, a phenomenon known as spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS) [1,2,3]. Our previous rodent flight studies have shown that spaceflight induces adverse effects on retinal structure, blood–retinal barrier (BRB) integrity, and retinal function [4,5]. More recent research also reports optic nerve swelling in astronauts and pathological changes around the optic nerve disc [6]. These findings warrant research on the role of spaceflight conditions, including microgravity (MG), on the optic nerve (ON) and retina (RTN) in the development of SANS [7]. To date, few studies have investigated the mechanisms and factors that contribute to the development of SANS. For the current study, AG was generated by onboard short-radius centrifuges installed in the Centrifuge-Equipped Biological Experiment Facility (CBEF) on board the ISS, created by JAXA [10]. Mice were exposed to either MG alone (0 G), or to 0.33 G, 0.67 G, or 1 G by centrifugation for the duration of a 30-day flight mission. Our in-depth transcriptomic analysis allowed us to robustly characterize and compare molecular responses in the ON and RTN. This study aims to evaluate whether AG could mitigate the deleterious effects of MG on the RTN and ON during spaceflight. Our study also aims to compare the effectiveness of different AG levels and define the relationship between gravitational dose and cellular response by assessing an oxidative stress biomarker and transcriptomic endpoints. This information is expected to provide valuable knowledge of the mechanisms that contribute to ON/RTN dysfunction and facilitate the development of an optimal AG protocol for eye protection during spaceflight. 2.1.

AG Attenuates a Spaceflight-Induced Increase in the Oxidative Stress Biomarker 4-Hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) in the RTN Cellular oxidative damage in the male mouse retina under AG at 0 G, 0.33 G, 0.67 G, and 1 G.

The FoxO signaling pathway is significantly enriched by pathway analysis in the ON due to spaceflight. Furthermore, the expression of genes within this pathway shows a pattern of progressive attenuation in moving from 0 G to 1 G of AG. FoxO proteins act as key regulators in a wide range of crucial cellular processes involving stress, metabolism, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis [21]. FoxO signaling dysregulation due to spaceflight conditions may lead to a negative impact on ON health. Similarly, the PI3k-Akt signaling pathway is significantly enriched by spaceflight in the ON, and patterns of gene expression within this pathway are progressively attenuated by increasing AG. The PI3k-Akt signaling pathway plays a key regulatory role in cellular processes, including apoptosis, cell survival, cell cycle progression, and metabolism [22]. Its influence in mediating neurological effects has been documented [23]. There is a strong link between activation of the PI3k-Akt signaling pathway and oxidative stress/inflammation [24,25]. Studies have shown that the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway is involved in the regulation of oxidative stress-induced apoptosis [26]. Interestingly, the PI3k-Akt signaling pathway is documented to be the most important pathway interacting with FoxO in regulating different physiological processes and pathological events or diseases [27]. In the RTN, the PPAR signaling pathway is significantly enriched due to spaceflight by pathway analysis, and genes within this pathway are progressively attenuated by increased AG doses. Genes within the PPAR signaling pathway play crucial roles in glucose and lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, and chronic inflammation [28]. A simulated MG study by hindlimb suspension revealed the differential expression of a number of transcripts, including the PPARs that regulate lipid and glucose metabolism in the muscle [29]. Our data from this study indicate that adding AG for the duration of spaceflight on the ISS, especially higher doses of 0.67 G and 1 G, can bring gene expression patterns closer to those of the grounded control group. This study provides evidence that in-flight AG can mitigate some of the effects of weightlessness during spaceflight. In this study, we found that the ON and RTN exhibited mostly distinct transcriptomic responses. The cellular components and structure of the ON and RTN are notably different in terms of cell types, astrocytic features, vascular density, and metabolic activity, as well as permeability and blood barrier properties [12]. Microvessels in the prelaminar region of the ON head lack blood–brain barrier (BBB) characteristic proteins, while the RTN has BBB biomarkers [30]. More recently, a study found that notable changes in the expression of several biomarkers related to the blood barrier in the ON head following space radiation exposure differ from those of the RTN [20]. The largely unique gene expression profiles observed in this study in the ON and RTN point to a complex response to space-specific environmental insults. Further studies are needed to investigate the underlying mechanisms linking the observed transcriptomic changes to the development of pathologic neuro-ophthalmic abnormalities. In order for the collected data from the current study to be comparable to the data from past MHU missions [9,32,33], only male mice were used in this study. However, we recognize the importance of studying both sexes for space research to understand how sex and gender differences impact long-term health in astronauts. It will be important in future research to incorporate both male and female mice to better understand their differences in response to space-specific environmental stressors. In the present study, we observed increased 4-HNE activity in the retinal GCL of the FLT 0 G and 0.33 G groups. The exact cell types of the positive staining need to be further characterized by double staining with specific biomarkers. However, the morphology of these 4-HNE signals resembles Müller cell endfeet. Müller cells are glial cells in the retina that provide metabolic and homeostatic support to neurons and photoreceptors. Increased activation and hypertrophy of Müller cells occurs in a process called gliosis in response to retinal damage or stress [32,33]. The effect of retinal gliosis on neurodegeneration has been reported [34]. Reduced 4-HNE staining on Müller cells by higher doses of AG may indicate protective effects against the impact of MG on the retina by mechanisms of attenuating oxidative stress and altering Müller glial activation and gliosis processes. 4.1. Mouse Habitat Unit-8 and Mouse Groups A total of 24 male C57BL/6J mice (Jackson laboratories, Inc., Bar Harbor, ME, USA) were individually housed on Earth during a four-week period of acclimation to housing, food, and water conditions. The mice were then transferred to the Transportation Cage Unit (TCU) and launched at ~12 weeks of age from the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) to the ISS on SpaceX CRS-27 (Dragon) on 15 March 2023 (GMT) for a 30-day MHU-8 mission. Within 24 h after arriving at the ISS, the animals were individually housed in the JAXA Habitat Cage Units (HCUs) located in the Kibo centrifuge hardware Cell Biology Experimental Facility on the ISS. The 24 flight mice were subdivided into four groups. The first group of flight mice were exposed to ambient microgravity conditions (0 G group), the second and third groups of flight mice were exposed to continuous AG of 0.33 G and 0.67 G, respectively, and the fourth group was exposed to continuous AG of 1 G. AG was achieved through the use of short-arm centrifuges for the duration of the MHU-8 mission, with only brief stoppages for husbandry and experimental procedures several times throughout the mission. The AG mice were subjected to AG immediately after being transferred to their HCUs. The rotation rates for generating 0.33 G, 0.67 G, and 1 G were 44 rpm, 63 rpm, and 77 rpm, respectively. The flight mice then splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean on 15 April 2023, and returned to Earth alive. A total of 12 male C57BL/6J HGC mice from the same cohort as the FLT mice were also housed individually during a four-week period of acclimation and were then maintained in similar habitat conditions as the FLT mice, inside the ISSES Chambers, with operations conducted with a 3-day delay relative to the FLT mice. All FLT and HGC mice received the same ad libitum access to food and water. Within 6 h of landing, all FLT mice were euthanized by inhalation of 3% isoflurane and then maintained at 1.5–2% for blood collection following euthanasia, and their eyes were removed and prepared for analysis. HGC mice were euthanized 3 days later by the same method. Animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of JAXA and NASA. No protocol was required from the Loma Linda University (LLU) IACUC, since only archived frozen and fixed tissues were obtained after euthanasia. The research with vertebrate animals was conducted in strict accordance with guidelines and applicable laws in Japan and the United States of America. 4.2. Mouse Eye Tissue Harvest and Preservation After necropsy, mouse eyes were harvested. The left eyes from each experimental group were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays. The retina and optic nerve of the right eyes were dissected out from the eye globe [35] and placed individually in sterile cryovials, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and kept at −80 °C prior to RNA extraction and RNA-seq. RNA was extracted using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) following the GeneLab SOP 3.1-Qiagen AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini with Qiagen RNase-Free DNase set (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_pdfs(accessed on 27 June 2023)). A homogenization buffer for RNA purification was made by adding 1:100 beta-mercaptoethanol to Buffer RLT (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) and was kept on ice until use. MHU-8 retina tissues processed in this experiment were not weighted before RNA extraction to avoid thawing, and 900 μL of cold homogenization buffer was added directly into the tissue tubes. Homogenization was performed using the rotor stator homogenizer (Polytron, Raymertown, NY, USA), with 3 repetitions of 10 s each at a speed of 21,000 as per the SOP 2.2-Tissue homogenization using Polytron Rotor Stator Homogenizer (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_pdfs(accessed on 27 June 2023)). Homogenates were centrifuged for 5 min at room temperature and 14,000 G to remove cell debris. The supernatant from each sample was then used to isolate and purify RNA following the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA was eluted in 40 μL RNAse-free H2O. Concentrations for all RNA samples were measured using the Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) with the Qubit RNA BR kit following the SOP 4.1-RNA/DNA/miRNA/cDNA Quantification using Qubit Fluorimeter (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_pdfs(accessed on 27 June 2023)). RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 4200 TapeStation with the Agilent RNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). 4.4. Optic Nerve RNA Extraction RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Universal kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s protocol. QIAzol was used as a homogenization buffer and was kept on ice until use. MHU-8 optic nerve tissues processed in this experiment were not weighted before RNA extraction to avoid thawing, and cold QIAzol homogenization buffer was added directly into the tissue tubes. Homogenization was performed using the rotor stator homogenizer (Polytron, Raymertown, NY, USA), with 3 repetitions of 10 s each at speed of 21,000 as per the SOP 2.2-Tissue homogenization using Polytron Rotor Stator Homogenizer (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_pdfs(accessed on 27 June 2023)). Homogenates were centrifuged for 5 min at room temperature and 14,000 G to remove cell debris. The supernatant from each sample was then used to isolate and purify RNA following the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA was eluted in 40 μL RNAse-free H2O. Concentrations for all RNA samples were measured using the Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) with Qubit RNA BR or HS kits following the SOP 4.1-RNA/DNA/miRNA/cDNA Quantification using Qubit Fluorimeter (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_pdfs(accessed on 27 June 2023)). RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 4200 TapeStation with the Agilent RNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). 4.5. Sequencing Library Construction ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In Mixes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA, Cat 4456739, v92), Mix 1 or Mix 2, were added on the day of library prep at the concentrations suggested by the manufacturer’s protocol. Spike-in data were used for sample quality control. RNA ribo depletion and library preparation were conducted with Illumina Stranded Total RNA Prep with Ribo-Zero Plus (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Input RNA was approximately 100 ng with RIN > 4. For RTN samples FLT17 and FLT02, and ON samples FLT11, FLT21, FLT04, FLT23, FLT12, FLT02, and HGC05, RNA input was below 30 ng, and ERCC spike-in and quality control could not be performed for these samples. Unique dual index adapters (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) were used, and 12 cycles of PCR were performed using the BioRad C1000 Touch (BIO RAD, Hercules, CA, USA). Library fragment size was assessed using Agilent 4200 TapeStation with D1000 DNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) following the GeneLab SOP 6.3 Quality analysis of sequencing libraries using 4200 TapeStation System with D1000 reagent kit (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_pdfs(accessed on 27 June 2023)). Pooled library concentration was measured by the Qubit 4 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scentific, Waltham, MA, USA) following the SOP 4.1-RNA/DNA/miRNA/cDNA Quantification using Qubit Fluorimeter (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_pdfs(accessed on 27 June 2023)). Library quality assessment was performed on iSeq100 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). RNA sequencing was performed by the GeneLab Sample Processing Lab on Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Sequencing was set up as follows: Read 1: 151 bp; Index1: 17 bp; Index2: 8 bp; Read 2: 151 bp. PhiX Sequencing Control V3 (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) was included as a control and to increase library diversity. The protocol followed is the SOP 7.1-Setting up NovaSeq 6000 and iSeq 100 Sequencers (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_pdfs(accessed on 27 June 2023)). Raw fastq files were assessed for percent rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) [36], and adaptors and low-quality bases were trimmed using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.7) [37] powered by Cutadapt (version 3.7) [38]. Trimmed fastq file quality was then evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9) [39], and MultiQC (version 1.1.9) [11] was used to generate MultiQC reports. Trimmed fastq files were then mapped with STAR (version 2.7.10a) [40]. We used the Ensembl [41] release 107, genome version GRCm39 (Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa) concatenated with ERCC92.fa from ThermoFisher (ThermoFisher Scentific, Waltham, MA, USA) as a reference genome. The following gtf annotation file was used: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.107.gtf concatenated with the ERCC92.gtf file from ThermoFisher. Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC Infer Experiment (version 4.0.0) [42,43]; then, aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1) [44], with strandedness set to reverse. Quantification data were imported to R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.22.0) [45] and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0) [46]; all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test, and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate theFstatisticp-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the following Bioconductor and annotation packages: STRINGdb (v2.8.4) [47,48,49], PANTHER.db (v1.0.11) [50,51,52], and org.Mm.eg.db (v3.15.0). Genes with |log2 FC| > 1 and Adjustedp< 0.05 were selected as significant DEGs. PCA plots for the ON and RTN were made separately using the normalized gene expression data obtained from DESeq2. The analysis was done in R (version 4.0.3). The R function aov() [53] was used to perform a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) on each gene using each treatment as a factor, and genes withp< 0.05 were selected for input into the PCA. PCAs were performed using the R function PCA() [54,55,56]. Pathway analysis and plotting were performed separately on the ON and RTN DEGs (FLT 0 G vs. HGC) using R (version 4.0.3) with the enrichR package (version 3.2) [57,58]. setEnrichrSite(“Enrichr”) was used for performing general enrichment analysis. Only the KEGG_2019_Mouse [59] library was used for analysis. 4.8. Comparison of DEGs Overlapping Between Spaceflight, Glaucoma, and Optic Nerve Crush Models Published glaucoma and optic nerve crush DEG tables (both relative to healthy controls) were obtained [12], and genes with |log2 FC| > 1 and Adjustedp< 0.05 were taken to be significant. Separate lists were obtained for the ON and RTN, which contained DEGs at all time points observed in the study for both optic nerve crush and glaucoma models. Optic nerve crush and glaucoma DEGs in unmyelinated optic nerve (UON) and myelinated optic nerve (MON) were combined into a single list for the ON. We then determined the overlaps between spaceflight (FLT 0 G vs. HGC) DEGs in the ON and the optic nerve crush + glaucoma DEGs in the ON, and similarly determined the overlaps between spaceflight DEGs in the RTN and the optic nerve crush + glaucoma DEGs in RTN. 4.9. Statistical Comparison of FLT 0 G vs. HGC and FLT 0 G vs. FLT 1 G DEG Overlaps For the ON and RTN separately, we counted the number of significant DEGs that changed in the same direction in the two comparisons (FLT 0 G vs. HGC and FLT 0 G vs. FLT 1 G) according to the log2 FC, and we similarly counted the number of DEGs that changed in the opposite direction. Let S = the number of DEGs changing in the same direction, O = the number of DEGs changing in the opposite direction, and n = S + O. We thus performed a binomial test using the function “binom.test” in R version 4.0.3, with x = S, n = N, andp= 0.5. 4.10. Immunostaining for Oxidative Stress Biomarker Evaluation Paraffin-embedded sections (six µm) of the left eye, roughly 100 mm apart, were used for analysis (n = 5–6/group). To evaluate oxidative damage in the retina, immunostaining was performed on ocular sections using the 4-HNE antibody specific to lipid peroxidation (catalog no. HNE11-S, Alpha Diagnostic International Inc., San Antonio, TX, USA). Sections were incubated with the anti-4-HNE antibody at 4 °C for 2 h followed by a donkey anti-rabbit IgG fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibody (catalog no. A21206, Invitrogen Corp., Waltham, MA, USA) for 2 h at room temperature and counterstained with DAPI. Six to ten field images were captured with a BZ-X700 inverted fluorescence microscope (Keyence Corp., Itasca, IL, USA) at 20× magnification spanning the entire retina sections. To determine 4-HNE immunoreactivity, fluorescence intensity (red channel for 4-HNE) was measured in these captured images of each section and calculated using ImageJ software (V1.53) [60]. The data were then extracted and averaged across 5 retina sections per eye within the group. We conclude that adding artificial gravity by centrifugation on board the ISS, especially near 1 G, can significantly reduce transcriptomic alteration induced by spaceflight in the optic nerve and retina. Such attenuation may effectively mitigate spaceflight-induced detrimental effects on ocular tissue. Clearly, more research on the ocular response to microgravity and its interaction with other spaceflight physiological stressors is warranted. Further investigation will also be needed to extend the observation time after the animals return alive from the centrifugation study on the ISS.
