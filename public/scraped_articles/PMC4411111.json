Vacuoles are dynamic compartments with constant fluctuations and transient structures such as trans-vacuolar strands and bulbs. Bulbs are highly dynamic spherical structures inside vacuoles that are formed by multiple layers of membranes and are continuous with the main tonoplast. We recently carried out a screen for mutants with abnormal trafficking to the vacuole or aberrant vacuole morphology. We characterizedregulator of bulb biogenesis1-1(rbb1-1), a mutant in Arabidopsis that contains increased numbers of bulbs when compared to the parental control.rbb1-1mutants also contain fewer transvacuolar strands than the parental control, and we propose the hypothesis that the formation of transvacuolar strands and bulbs is functionally related. We propose that the bulbs may function transiently to accommodate membranes and proteins when transvacuolar strands fail to elongate. We show that RBB1 corresponds to a very large protein of unknown function that is specific to plants, is present in the cytosol, and may associate with cellular membranes. RBB1 is involved in the regulation of vacuole morphology and may be involved in the establishment or stability of trans-vacuolar strands and bulbs. Bulbs are spherical structures of diameters between 1 and 10 μm that are highly dynamic in the lumen of the vacuole. These membrane structures are associated with the outer tonoplast membrane or transvacuolar strands and contain cytoplasmic structures, even organelles, between the folded membranes [5,15]. Imaging by electron microscopy has indicated that bulbs are formed by multiple layers of tonoplast membranes, which explains the increased intensity of bulbs in fluorescently labeled tonoplasts [15]. Bulbs are present in LVs of cotyledon and leaf epidermis and their numbers decrease during cotyledon expansion [15], and leaf maturation [16]. Bulbs have been visualized by fluorescencence microscopy of fluorescent protein (FP) fusions with several tonoplast proteins and in multiple cell types. For example, in vacuoles of tobacco leaves, bulbs were observed when GFP-VAM3/SYP22 [17] or a GFP fusion with the phosphate transporter NPT2 [18] were transiently expressed. In Arabidopsis, bulbs have been detected in epidermis of the root elongation zone and the leaf, sepal bundle sheet, and germinating pollen of stably transformed plants expressing either GFP-AtVAM3 [5], TPK1-GFP [19,20], TIP1;1-GFP [21], or FP fusions with other tonoplast intrinsic proteins [16,22]. In addition, the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate sensor 2xFYVE-YFP also labels the bulbs [23]. These structures are not simply the result of ectopic expression of FP fusions because they were also detected in Arabidopsis WT plants by electron microscopy [15]. It was recently proposed that bulbs may form by dimerization of GFP or YFP tags when fused to tonoplast markers, and that some of these structures may be artifacts from this interaction [24]. Two types of structures were distinguished: bulbs associated with high levels of expression of GFP fusions that showed 3 or more fold increase in fluorescence intensity compared to the tonoplast, and “intra-vacuolar spherical structures” (IVSPs) present in transgenic lines in which the intensity of fluorescence was only two fold that of the tonoplast and were visualized with a non-dimerizing GFP molecule. This distinction was most dramatic in the root elongation zone where only very bright bulbs were observed, but it was more complex in other tissues, such as the cotyledon epidermis, where both types of structures existed [24]. Two hypotheses for the function of bulbs have been proposed. Bulbs may act as reservoirs of membranes for cell expansion or they may represent the first step for proteolysis of tonoplast proteins inside the vacuole [15,19]. Only two mutants with bulb phenotypes have been identified thus far. These aresgr2-1andvti11, and in both cases these mutants show a reduced number of bulbs [23]. SGR2 encodes a protein similar to phospholipase A1, andsgr2mutants have an abnormal vacuole morphology with multiple small vacuole-like structures and abnormal distribution of the vacuole and the cytosol in shoot endodermal cells [25]. VTI11 encodes a SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) protein that mediates membrane fusion between pre-vacuolar compartments and the vacuole [26,27]. VTI11 is also involved in vacuole homotypic fusion, andvti11mutant alleles have highly fragmented vacuoles [28]. Given the highly abnormal vacuole morphology of these two mutants, it is unclear if the lack of bulbs is a direct or indirect effect of the loss of SGR2 and VTI11. Here we describe the phenotype ofregulator of bulb biogenesis1(rbb1-1), a novel mutant in Arabidopsis that displays increased numbers of bulbs in otherwise normal vacuoles. We show thatrbb1-1mutants make fewer TVS than the parental control. We propose the hypothesis that RBB1 may function in TVS formation and that increased bulb accumulation inrbb1-1may result from impaired formation of TVS. In addition, we show that the differential labeling of bulbs betweenrbb1-1and the parental line does not result from abnormal trafficking to the vacuole. We also identifiedRBB1locus, which encodes a large plant-specific protein of unknown function. Plant Material and Growth Conditions The parental line carrying GFP-TIP2;1 and mCherry-HDEL [29], and the marker lines TIP1;1-YFP [16] and SYP22-RFP [30] were previously described. SALK_095160, SALK_067590 and SALK_074387 were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC) and genotyped by PCR. pUBQ10::RFP-TIP1;1 was generated by Gateway cloning (Invitrogen). Briefly, the TIP1;1 CDS was amplified from Col-0 cDNA by PCR and the amplicon was introduced into pENTR-D-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). A RFP-TIP1;1 expression clone was generated by recombination with pUBN-RFP [31] using LR clonase II (Invitrogen). The promoter of the resulting construct was substituted with the full pUBQ10 promoter (1,596 bp) from pNIGEL07 (Geldner et al 2009) to generatepUBQ10::RFP-TIP1;1. TheRBB1::3xYpet-RBB1andRBB1::RBB1-3xYpetconstructs were generated by a Recombineering-based gene tagging system [32] using the JAtY76M24 clone and the primers listed inS1 Table. After introducing 3xYpet, the JAtY clone was shortened by homologous recombination using \"delleft\" and \"RB-amp\" primers (S1 Table). This resulted in a fragment of the chromosomal region containing 12.8 kb upstream of start codon ofRBB1and up to 5 kb downstream from the stop codon. These constructs were transformed into Agrobacterium GV3101 and then transformed into Col-0 wild type plants via floral dip [33]. Seeds were plated on AGM (0.5X MS media and 1% sucrose) with 4 g /L GelRite. For light-grown seedlings, seeds were cold treated for 4 days in the dark to break dormancy and then incubated at 22°C under a 16 h light photoperiod. For dark-grown seedlings, seeds were cold treated in the dark and then incubated at 22°C while covered in aluminum foil. Chemical Stocks and Treatments C834 (ID 6982834) was from Chembridge, Brefeldin A from Sigma and Lysotracker Red and FM4-64 from Invitrogen. All chemicals were dissolved in 100% DMSO and all treatments were carried out with 4-day old seedlings, unless specified. BFA treatment was done in liquid AGM containing 75 μM BFA and for 3 h. C834 treatment was done with 3-d-old seedlings in solid AGM-GelRite supplemented with 55μM C834 for 48 hours as described [29]. For staining, seedlings were incubated in liquid AGM containing 2 μM Lysotracker Red for 2 h or 5 μM FM4-64 for 5 min. A Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope was used for all imaging experiments. A 40x water objective (1.1 N.A.) was used to image embryos and roots. A 20x objective (0.8 N.A.) was used to image hypocotyls and cotyledons. The excitation/emission wavelengths during acquisition were 488 nm/492–570 nm for GFP and Ypet, 561 nm/588–696 nm for mCherry and RFP, 514 nm/588–700 nm for FM4-64, and 561 nm/566-690 nm for Lysotracker red. To count the number of TVS, seedlings were imaged using a large pinhole to generate 600 μm thick optical sections for hypocotyls and 102 μm sections for cotyledons. A 40X objective was used and image zoom was kept at 0.6. Epidermal cells within the bottom half of the hypocotyl, but excluding the root-shoot junction, were used for TVS counting in hypocotyls. Epidermal cells from the adaxial side were used for cotyledons. TVS were counted in each cell from the collected images. Total mRNA was extracted using TRI reagent (Ambion) and treated with DNase I (NEB). cDNA was synthesized using iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (BioRad) and was used a template for RT-PCR. Oligo sequences used for PCR are shown inS2 Tableand 30 cycles were used for all reactions. Map-based cloning and genome sequencing Total proteins were extracted from 7 day-old seedlings. Samples were homogenized in 50mM HEPES-KOH, pH 6.5, 5 mM EDTA, 8% sucrose, 1mM DTT and proteinase inhibitors (Complete Mini, EDTA-free, Roche Diagnostics) in a chilled mortar. The homogenates were spun at 5,000g for 10 min at 4°C and the supernatant was filtered through 3 layers of miracloth. For membrane protein fractions (P100), filtered total proteins were spun at 100,000g for 1 h at 4°C and the pellet was resuspended in buffer. Protein concentration was quantified by the Bradford assay. For immunoblot of 3xYpet-RBB1, 8 μg of proteins were loaded in a NuPAGE 3–8% Tris-Acetate gel (Life Technologies) following manufacturer instructions. The following antibodies were used: anti-GFP (Thermo MA5-15256), anti-cFBase (Agrisera AS04043), anti-H+ATPase (Agrisera AS07260) and anti-calreticulin [35]. Peroxidase-Conjugated Goat Anti-Mouse IgG (Thermo 32430) or peroxidase-conjugated Goat Anti-Rabbit (Thermo 32460) antibodies were used as secondary antibodies. Immunoblots were visualized by chemiluminescence with Clarity Western ECL Substrate (BioRad) using a G:BOX Chemi XRQ system (Syngene) for image capture. Signal was quantified using the GeneTools image analysis software (Syngene). GFP-TIP2;1 labels excess bulbs inregulator of bulb biogenesis1 We recently carried out a screen for mutants in tonoplast protein trafficking and vacuole biogenesis and characterized the function of the VTI11 SNARE protein and phosphoinositides in vacuole fusion [28]. During the course of this work, we identified a mutant in which the tonoplast protein GFP-TIP2;1 labeled many vacuolar bulbs and it was namedregulator of bulb biogenesis1-1(rbb1-1). In the parental line, the GFP-TIP2;1 protein labels the tonoplast and very few bulbs in root epidermis and cortex and the epidermis of hypocotyls, cotyledons and rosette leaves (Fig 1A–1D) [16,28,36]. In therbb1-1mutant, GFP-TIP2;1 also labels the tonoplast, and the size and morphology of the vacuole appeared normal. However, many more bulbs were evident as bright sub-vacuolar structures in multiple tissues (Fig 1E–1H). In hypocotyls, bulbs were observed consistently in many cells in the epidermis and cortex (Fig 1E). Bulbs were also apparent in high numbers in the epidermis of cotyledons and rosette leaves ofrbb1-1(Fig 1F and 1H). Vacuolar bulbs were detected in roots (Fig 1G), but this phenotype was variable amongst different seed stocks and was not characterized further. The variability in the root phenotype may be due to root-specific modifying factors that segregate in the population. No major defects in plant morphology were detected inrbb1-1homozygous plants (S1 Fig). Sequencing demonstrated that theGFP-TIP2;1transgene is intact inrbb1-1and consequently, the bulb phenotype is not related to a mutation in the GFP-TIP2;1 protein sequence. Fig 1.regulator of bulb biogenesis1contains many bulbs in many cell types. (a-h)rbb1-1mutants have more bulbs than the parental line. GFP-TIP2;1 localization in the parental line (WT, a-d) orrbb1-1(e-h). Four-day-old seedlings were imaged by confocal microscopy to visualize morphology of the vacuole in the epidermis of hypocotyl (a, e) and cotyledon (b, f), and in root epidermis and cortex (c, g). The bulb phenotype was also observed in rosette leaves of 6-week-old plants (d, h). Scale bar = 20 μm. (i-n) GFP-TIP2;1 and RFP-TIP1;1 co-localize inrbb1-1bulbs. The hypocotyls of 4-day-old dark-grown seedlings expressing GFP-TIP2;1 (green, i, l) and RFP-TIP1;1 (magenta, j, m) in the parental line (i-k) andrbb1-1mutants (l-n) are shown. Merged images (k, n) are also shown. Scale bar: 20 μm. (o)rbb1-1mutants do not accumulate higher levels of GFP-TIP2;1 in seedlings. Immunoblot of GFP-TIP2;1 accumulation in the parental line andrbb1-1using antibodies against GFP (α-GFP) and Calreticulin (α-CRT) as loading control. In order to comparerbb1-1bulbs with the IVSPs and bulbs previously described [24], we measured the maximum intensity values for bulb membranes inrbb1-1. As shown inS2 Fig, maximum intensity values for the bulbs in the parental line are 1.2- and 1.3-fold higher than the outer tonoplast in cotyledons and hypocotyls, respectively. In contrast,rbb1-1bulbs have 2 fold higher intensity than the tonoplast in hypocotyl, and 3.5-fold higher in cotyledons. Therefore,rbb1-1bulbs would fit the description of both IVSPs and bulbs [24]. Moreover, given the fact that the GFP-TIP2;1 protein levels inrbb1-1mutants is similar to the parental line, we conclude that therbb1-1bulbs are not simply the result of increased GFP dimerization in the mutant. However, we can not discard the possibility that GFP dimerization acts as an enhancer of therbb1phenotype. Given the complexity of these structures, we will refer to them here simply as bulbs. Fig 2.rbb1-1mutants have fewer transvacuolar strands. (a) The number of trans-vacuolar strands (TVS) per cell was counted in cotyledon cells from the parental line andrbb1-1seedlings that were grown in the light. n = 48 cells from 8 seedlings. (b)rbb1-1mutants have fewer TVS in hypocotyl from light- and dark-grown seedlings. Seedlings were germinated in the light or dark for 4 days and TVS were counted. n = 60 cells from 10 seedlings. Bars represent standard error. * Significantly different to the parental line in a t-test (P ≤ 0.05). Therbb1-1phenotype can be detected 3 days post-germination Fig 3. Developmental progression of therbb1-1phenotype and effects from light. (a-j) The bulb phenotype is apparent in hypocotyls after 3 d of germination. Germinating seedlings from the parental line (GFP-TIP2;1, a-e) andrbb1-1mutants (f-j) were imaged after 0–4 days of incubation. (k-n) The bulb phenotype ofrbb1-1is present in light- and dark-grown seedlings. GFP-TIP2;1 localization in hypocotyls was visualized in 4-d-old seedlings from the parental line (WT, k, m) orrbb1-1(l, n) when grown under light (k, l) or dark (m, n) conditions. n = 36 cells from 6 seedlings. All scale bars = 20 μm. (o) Dark treatment does not alter therbb1-1phenotype. The number of bulbs was counted in hypocotyls from parental line andrbb1-1seedlings that were grown in the light or in the dark as in k-n. n = 9–15 seedlings. Bars represent standard error. (p)rbb1-1hypocotyls have fewer TVS after 3 d of germination. Seedlings were germinated in the light and TVS were counted after 2 days of incubation. n = 50 cells from 5 seedlings. Bars represent standard error. * Significantly different to the parental line in a t-test (P ≤ 0.01). One proposed function of the bulbs is to contribute membranes during cell expansion [15]. This prompted us to investigate whether therbb1-1phenotype was affected by conditions that promoted cell expansion such as the elongation of hypocotyls in the dark. To this end, vacuoles from the hypocotyl epidermis of parental andrbb1-1seedlings that were grown either in the light or the dark were imaged in the microscope, and bulbs were counted. While the parental control seedlings grown in the light contain 0.10 ± 0.03 bulbs per 103μm2(Fig 3K and 3O), therbb1-1mutant contains 1.00 ± 0.16 (Fig 3L and 3O). Therefore, therbb1-1mutant contains 10 fold more bulbs per area in hypocotyls when compared to the parental control grown under normal light conditions. Next we analyzed the phenotype ofrbb1-1mutants in the dark. In contrast to the dark-grown parental control, which contains 0.07 ± 0.01 bulbs per 103μm2(Fig 3M and 3O), the dark-grownrbb1-1mutant showed 1.18 ± 0.09 bulbs per 103μm2(Fig 3N and 3O), or a 16-fold increase. Thus, the number of bulbs inrbb1-1was higher than the parental under both light treatments, but light availability did not significantly alter therbb1-1phenotype. We then tested whether the increased number of bulbs would enhance the elongation rate of dark-grownrbb1-1seedlings, but no differences in hypocotyl length were detected between the mutant and the parental control at 3 or 5 d (S3C Fig). Furthermore, cell elongation was not affected, as we could not detect significant differences in cell size between the wild type andrbb1-1hypocotyls when grown in the dark (S3D Fig). Finally, if theRBB1is responsible for the bulb and TVS phenotypes ofrbb1-1, we expected a similar developmental progression, which can be tested by quantification of TVS during germination. TVS could not clearly be detected before day 2, and no significant difference was detected at day 2 between wild type andrbb1-1hypocotyls when grown in the light (Fig 3P) However, the number of TVS was reduced by 28% inrbb1-1when compared to the wild type. This reduction was even greater (41%) at day 4. Therefore, the appearance of the bulb phenotype at days 3 and 4 correlates well with the reduction of TVS numbers inrbb1-1. GFP-TIP2;1 trafficking to the vacuole is not altered inrbb1-1 The increased number of bulbs inrbb1-1could be the result of abnormal GFP-TIP2;1 protein trafficking to the vacuole. To test this hypothesis, two inhibitors for tonoplast protein trafficking were used. Brefeldin A (BFA) inhibits a Golgi-dependent pathway for tonoplast proteins in hypocotyls and C834 inhibits a Golgi-independent traffic of GFP-TIP2;1 to the tonoplast [29]. We treated the GFP-TIP2;1 (parental control), the TIP1;1-YFP line and therbb1-1mutant with BFA and visualized each fusion protein in hypocotyls. The fusion proteins localized to the tonoplast (GFP-TIP2;1) or tonoplast and bulbs (rbb1-1and TIP1;1-YFP) in the DMSO control as expected (Fig 4A–4C). In BFA-treated cells, the GFP-TIP2;1 localization was unchanged in the parental control (Fig 4D) orrbb1-1(Fig 4E), indicating that the trafficking of this protein was still BFA-insensitive. In contrast and consistent with previous reports [29], the TIP1;1-YFP marker line displayed large and bright aggregates in the presence of BFA (Fig 4F). Next we tested sensitivity to C834. GFP-TIP2;1 localized to the tonoplast and did not co-localize with the ER marker mCherry-HDEL in neither the parental line orrbb1-1(Fig 4G–4I and 4M–4O). In contrast, GFP-TIP2;1 co-localized with the ER marker in C834-treated roots of the parental line (Fig 4J–4L) andrbb1-1(Fig 4P–4R). Therefore, we conclude that GFP-TIP2;1 traffics in a similar pathway inrbb1-1and the parental line, at least early in the secretory pathway, and that the bulb-localization of GFP-TIP2;1 inrbb1-1does not appear to be the result of altered trafficking to the vacuole. Fig 4. GFP-TIP2;1 trafficking to the vacuole is similar betweenrbb1-1and the parental line. (a-f) BFA inhibits trafficking of TIP1;1YFP but not GFP-TIP2;1 in the parental line orrbb1-1. Four-day-old seedlings from the parental (GFP-TIP2;1, a, d),rbb1-1(b, e) or TIP1;1-YFP (c, f) were exposed to 0.1% DMSO (control, a, b, c) or 75 μM BFA (d, e, f) for 3 hours and hypocotyl cells were imaged. BFA compartments are indicated with arrows. Scale: 20 μm. (g-r) C834 inhibits GFP-TIP2;1 trafficking in the parental line andrbb1-1. Three-day-old seedlings from the parental line andrbb1-1were exposed to 0.5% DMSO (g-i, m-o) or 55 μM C834 (j-l, p-r) for 48 h, and root cells were imaged in the microscope. Signal from GFP-TIP2;1 (green, g, j, m, p), the ER marker mCherry-HDEL (magenta, h, k, n, p) or the merged image is shown (i, l, o, r). Co-localization of GFP with mCherry-HDEL at the ER is indicated with arrowheads. Scale bar: 20 μm. TheRBB1locus corresponds toAt5g40450 The bulb phenotype ofrbb1-1segregated as 25 out of 96 (1/3.84) in a backcross to the GFP-TIP2;1 parental line, suggesting that therbb1-1mutation is recessive. In order to identify theRBB1locus, we used a combination of map-based cloning and whole genome sequencing. TheRBB1gene mapped to a region of 2.2Mb in Chromosome 5 between markers RBCS-B and PINHEAD. Using Illumina whole-genome sequencing, we identified nucleotide variants in therbb1-1mutant genome between these two markers. From those, only two SNPs located within gene coding sequences and corresponding to EMS-type non-silent mutations were detected, inAt5g38540andAt5g40450. In order to determine which gene corresponded to theRBB1locus, we identified Salk T-DNA insertion alleles [38] for both candidate genes. Only one T-DNA line, SALK_095160, forAt5g38540was available, but no homozygote plants could be recovered. Heterozygous plants were crossed torbb1-1and the vacuole phenotype of F1seedlings grown in the dark was analyzed. Out of 27 F1seedlings, none showed therbb1-1bulb phenotype indicating thatRBB1was unlikely to correspond toAt5g38540. We obtained two SALK T-DNA alleles forAt5g40450(Fig 5A). However, one of the T-DNA lines, SALK_067590, had a complex transgene insertion and could not be used. We used RT-PCR to determine ifAt5g40450was expressed in SALK_074387. The expression of the full lengthAt5g40450was disrupted in SALK_074387 (Fig 5B), and therefore, this was a good mutant allele to test for the bulb phenotype. However, it is unclear if this allele is a complete loss of function allele because partial transcripts can be detected by RT-PCR. We named this allelerbb1-2. Fig 5. TheRBB1locus corresponds toAt5g40450. (a) Schematic structure of theRBB1locus indicating the positions ofrbb1alleles. Exons are indicated as black boxes and introns are indicated as white boxes. 5' and 3' UTRs are indicated in gray. Triangles indicate T-DNA insertions of SALK lines.

(b) Accumulation ofRBB1transcripts as determined by RT-PCR with gene specific primers in seedlings from Col-0 (WT),rbb1-2, the GFP-TIP2;1 parental line andrbb1-1.

(c-e) Lack of genetic complementation betweenrbb1-1andrbb1-2. Hypocotyls of four-day-old dark-grown seedlings from the parental control (WT, c),rbb1-1(d) and the F1progeny from a cross betweenrbb1-1andrbb1-2(rbb1-1/rbb1-2double heterozygotes, e) were imaged by confocal microscopy. Scale bar: 20μm. (f-g)rbb1-2contains bulbs in a similar manner asrbb1-1. Four-day-old seedlings were stained with 2 μM Lysotracker Red for 2 hours to label the vacuole in Col-0 (WT) andrbb1-2. Bulbs are indicated with arrows. Scale: 20 μm. (h)RBB1is expressed in many developmental stages. The accumulation ofRBB1transcripts was determined by RT-PCR with gene specific primers in various tissues of 4 and 7-day old Col-0 (WT) plants. Two pairs of gene specific primers detected the 5' end and 3' end ofRBB1gene as indicated in (a). In order to characterize the function ofRBB1, a fluorescent protein (FP) fusion was generated to visualize its protein localization. Given the large size of theRBB1coding sequence, we used Recombineering [32] to generate a FP fusion with RBB1 driven by its own promoter and other regulatory sequences. This system utilizes homologous recombination with TAC clones to fuse the gene encoding 3xYpet (YFP for energy transfer), a bright variation of YFP [48], to the gene of interest within the native genomic context. Both N- and C-terminal fusions of RBB1 with 3xYpet were generated and introduced into Col-0 wild type. We could not detect fluorescence in RBB1-3xYpet lines after selection of 15 independent transformants. However, 3xYpet-RBB1 was detected in cotyledon epidermal cells, root cortical cells and, although very faint, in the cortex of hypocotyls of light-grown seedlings (S5A and S5B Fig). No Ypet signal was detected at the root tip corresponding to the cell division zone. In order to determine if the 3xYpet-RBB1 fusion is functional, we introgressed the transgene into therbb1-2allele by crossing. This experiment was carried out inrbb1-2because the GFP-TIP2;1 marker inrbb1-1is tightly linked to theRBB1locus and the probability of identifyingrbb1-1segregants without GFP-TIP2;1 was very low. In contrast torbb1-2seedlings stained with Lysotracker red, which showed many bulbs in cotyledons (Fig 6A),rbb1-2seedlings expressing the 3xYpet-RBB1 protein have vacuole morphology very similar to the wild type (Fig 6B and 6C). Therefore, the 3xYpet-RBB1 construct complements the bulb phenotype ofrbb1-2indicating that this fusion protein is functional. Fig 6. 3xYpet-RBB1 is a cytoplasmic protein that associates with the tonoplast. (a-c) A 3xYpet-RBB1 fusion complements the bulb phenotype ofrbb1-2. Four-day-old seedlings fromrbb1-2(a) orrbb1-23xYpet-RBB1 (b, c) were stained with Lysotracker Red (magenta, a, b) to label the vacuole. The signal from 3xYpet-RBB1 (c) for the complemented plant is shown. (d-f) 3xYpet-RBB1 does not co-localize with FM4-64.

Seedlings from the 3xYpet-RBB1 line were stained with Lysotracker Red. Signal from 3xYpet-RBB1 (j), Lysotracker Red (k) and the merged image (l) are shown. Arrowheads indicate the localization of 3xYpet-RBB1 at the tip of elongating trans-vacuolar strands. (m-o) GFP molecules can also label the tips of transvacuolar strands. Seedlings from a 35::GFP marker line were stained with Lysotracker Red. The GFP signal (m), Lysotracker Red (n) and the merged image (o) are shown. Arrowheads indicate the tip of TVS. All scale bars = 20 μm. (p) 3xYpet-RBB1 accumulates in the soluble (S100) and membrane pellet (P100) fractions from whole seedlings. Immunoblot of 3xYpet-RBB1 soluble (S100) and membrane (P100) fractions from Col-0 and 3xYpet-RBB1 transgenic plants using antibodies against GFP (α-GFP), cFBPase (α-cFBPase, control for soluble fraction), and Plasma Membrane H+ATPase (α-H+ATPase, control for membrane fraction). RBB1encodes a very large protein with unknown molecular function. In order to determine the function ofRBB1, we generated a 3xYpet-RBB1 fusion protein under the control of theRBB1promoter. This construct complemented therbb1-2mutant phenotype indicating that the 3xYpet-RBB1 fusion is functional. In seedlings, 3xYpet-RBB1 was detected in the root in the elongation and differentiation zones, but not in the cell division zone, and in hypocotyl and cotyledon epidermal cells. Therefore, 3xYpet-RBB1 accumulates in cells that contain a large lytic vacuole [51], consistent with a role of RBB1 in regulating the morphology of this important organelle. Confocal scanning laser microscopy with the 3xYpet-RBB1 line indicated that this protein accumulates in the cytosol, and that in a few instances also co-localizes with Lysotracker red, a fluorescent dye that labels the tonoplast. RBB1 was found both in the soluble and membrane fractions by fractionation experiments, which raises the possibility that RBB1 may associate with membranes. 3xYpet-RBB1 was often present at the tips of elongating TVS in cotyledons and leaves, but visualization of a GFP control indicated that this localization may be detected some times with other cytosolic proteins. Previously proposed functions of vacuolar bulbs include acting as a tonoplast reservoir for rapid growth or serving as the sites of degradation of tonoplast membrane and proteins (Saito et al. 2002 and Maîtrejean et al. 2011). We tested one of these hypotheses by measuring the hypocotyl growth ofrbb1-1in the dark, a condition that promotes cell elongation. However, no obvious growth differences were observed betweenrbb1-1and the parental line. One possibility is that the additional tonoplast membranes contained inrbb1-1bulbs do not contribute to cell elongation. Alternatively, other factors such as the elasticity of the cell wall [49] may be limiting and would prevent us from detecting a difference in this assay. TheRBB1gene is expressed in seedlings and adult plants both in shoots and roots. ThatRBB1is expressed as a full-length transcript of 8,957 bp is supported by several ESTs as well as the alignment of RNAseq reads spanning the entire coding sequence by the Integrated Genome Browser [52,53]. The molecular function of RBB1 is unknown as the protein has no conserved domains, and it represents a new plant-specific protein. The identification of proteins that interact with RBB1 may shed light on the molecular mechanisms by which RBB1 could regulate the morphology of the vacuole. (a-b) Normal growth phenotype of 4 day-old seedlings (a), and 6 week-old plants (b) from the parental line,rbb1-1, Col-0, andrbb1-2. (c) Relative GFP content in the parental line andrbb1-1by immunoblotting. The intensity values for GFP fromFig 1Owere normalized against the Calreticulin (CRT) loading control. (a, b) Examples of fluorescence intensity profiles that were used to estimate intensity values in the parental line (a) andrbb1-1(b). Intensity value profiles from a line selection (white lines) across each bulb or the tonoplast were extracted in Image J from confocal images. Only the maximum value was collected for each line selection (arrowheads). (c, d) Maximum fluorescence intensity of bulbs and the tonoplast from cotyledon (c) and hypocotyl cells (d) in the parental line orrbb1-1grown in the light. Images were analyzed as in (a, b). Data shown is the average of maximum intensity values for 10–15 images from at least 3 seedlings each. The numbers inside the white bars correspond to the calculated ratio between the maximum fluorescence intensity in the bulbs and that of the tonoplast. Identical microscope settings were used when collecting data for cotyledons or when collecting data for hypocotyls. (a-b) An example of images used for TVS quantification. Thick optical sections were captured from hypocotyls (a). A seedling from the parental line is shown. The boxed area is enlarged in (b) to show the TVS that were counted (arrowhead). Bar = 20 μm.
