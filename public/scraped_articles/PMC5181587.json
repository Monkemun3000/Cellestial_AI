  "content": "Wortmannin-induced vacuole fusion enhances amyloplast dynamics in Arabidopsiszigzag1hypocotyls * Correspondence:mrojasp@ncsu.edu Editor: Chris Hawes, Oxford Brookes University The highly restricted movement of amyloplasts in graviperceptive cells ofzig-1hypocotyls is overcome by wortmannin treatment, suggesting a physical association between amyloplasts and the vacuole. Key words:Amyloplasts, cytoskeleton, gravitropism, SNARE, vacuole, wortmannin. Plants have the capacity to sense and respond to the direction of gravity by precise modulation of growth patterns in roots and shoots (Hashiguchiet al., 2013). Gravitropism involves mechanisms of perception, signal transduction and auxin-directed differential growth. According to the starch-statolith hypothesis, sedimentation of amyloplasts in response to gravity stimuli is critical for gravity sensing (Massonet al., 2002). Gravity perception in Arabidopsis shoots depends on the ability to sense the position of starch-filled amyloplasts, called statoliths, within shoot endodermal cells, or statocytes (Fukakiet al., 1998). This is supported by evidence that (i) mutants lacking an endodermis display agravitropic shoots (Fukakiet al., 1998), (ii) starchless mutants or mutants that lack amyloplasts show reduced gravitropism (Kisset al., 1997;Weise and Kiss, 1999;Fujihiraet al., 2000), (iii) hypergravity restored gravitropic sensitivity in starch-deficient mutants (Fitzelle and Kiss, 2001), and (iv) there is significant movement (sedimentation) of amyloplasts following gravistimulation (Saitoet al., 2005;Hashiguchiet al., 2014). The sedimentation of amyloplasts in shoot statocytes is thought to trigger downstream signaling events, including changes in the transport of and response to auxin (Rakusovaet al., 2011). The early events of signal transduction for gravitropism remain largely unknown, although several genes have been suggested to function in its early phases (Blancaflor and Masson, 2003). The current model of gravity sensing implicates the plant vacuole in the shoot gravity response (Moritaet al., 2002;Yanoet al., 2003;Hashiguchiet al., 2013). Shoot endodermal cells contain a large central vacuole that occupies most of the cell volume, and its role in gravity sensing is well established. Mutants with vacuolar defects, including mutant alleles ofSHOOT GRAVITROPISM6(SGR6),VTI11/ZIGZAG-1(ZIG-1)/SGR4,SYNTAXIN OF PLANTS22(SYP22)/SGR3andKATAMARI2(KAM2) were identified from screens for agravitropic shoots in Arabidopsis (Fukakiet al., 1996b;Yamauchiet al., 1997;Katoet al., 2002;Moritaet al., 2002;Yanoet al., 2003;Saitoet al., 2005;Hashiguchiet al., 2014). A common phenotype in these mutants was the abnormal localization of amyloplasts in relation to the vacuole or abnormal vacuole morphology. In the case ofzig-1mutants, the movement of amyloplasts in the endodermis of the inflorescence stem was greatly reduced (Yanoet al., 2003). Both VTI11 and SYP22 are SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) proteins that have important roles in membrane fusion at the vacuole, including homotypic vacuole fusion (Chen and Scheller, 2001;Wickner, 2010;Zhenget al., 2014b). Two mutant alleles ofVTI11,zig-1andimpaired traffic to tonoplast3(itt3), have multiple vacuoles per cell (Zhenget al., 2014a,b). Treatment ofitt3andzig-1with wortmannin (Wm), an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase), resulted in vacuole fusion, and enhanced hypocotyl gravitropism (Zhenget al., 2014b). This result is consistent with fragmented vacuoles being responsible for the agravitropic phenotype ofzig-1. Two other proteins associated with endomembranes were implicated in gravitropism. KAT2 is a membrane-associated protein (Tamuraet al., 2007), and SGR6 is a HEAT-domain containing protein involved in vacuole membrane remodeling (Hashiguchiet al., 2014). The roles of KAT2 or SGR6 in gravitropism are still unknown. In addition to the vacuole, important roles for actin filaments have been reported, but their role during shoot gravitropic perception remains unclear (Blancaflor, 2013). Actin depolymerizing drugs have been reported to enhance gravity response in hypocotyls (Yamamoto and Kiss, 2002;Yamamotoet al., 2002), reduce amyloplast sedimentation in endodermal cells (Palmieri and Kiss, 2005) or have no effect in experiments with live cells (Saitoet al., 2005). An important role of the actin cytoskeleton was demonstrated by the identification of theshoot gravitropism9(sgr9) mutant, which shows reduced amyloplast sedimentation due to increased interactions between amyloplasts and F-actin (Nakamuraet al., 2011).SGR9encodes an E3 ligase that may disrupt the attachment of amyloplasts to F-actin during saltatory movements and as a result promote amyloplast sedimentation (Nakamuraet al., 2011). The difficulty of establishing a role of F-actin in gravity perception may be due to the complexity of interactions that it may have with a multitude of cellular components, including amyloplasts. Plant material and growth conditions Thezig-1mutant line was previously described (Katoet al., 2002). The parental anditt3lines contain the green fluorescent protein (GFP)-TIP2;1 and the mCherry-HDEL markers (Zhenget al., 2014b), and marker lines expressing the fluorescent protein fusions VHA-a1:GFP (Dettmeret al., 2006), ABD2-GFP (Wanget al., 2004) and TUA6-GFP (Uedaet al., 1999) were described before. Seeds were surface sterilized and incubated at 4 °C in the dark for 2–5 d. Seeds were sown on Arabidopsis growth medium (AGM; 0.5× Murashige and Skoog medium, 4 g l–1GelRite, 1% (w/v) sucrose) and transferred to a 22 °C growth chamber with 16 h/8 h day/night photoperiod. For dark grown experiments, plants were incubated in light for 8 h to stimulate germination prior to growth in the dark. Plasmid construction and plant transformations ThepSCR::TIP1;1-GFPconstruct was generated by amplifying a 2 kb fragment corresponding to theSCARECROWpromoter (pSCR2.0) from pENTR 5′pSCR2.0 (Levesqueet al., 2006;Sozzaniet al., 2010) using primers 5′-AAGCTTTGCCAAA CAGATATTTGCATTTGGGCTATG-3′ and 5′-CTCGAGTAGG AGATTGAAGGGTTGTT-3′. The pSCR2.0 PCR fragment was cloned into VAC-GK (Nelsonet al., 2007) by restriction enzyme and ligation withHindIII andXhoI to generatepSCR::TIP1;1-GFP. The resulting plasmid was then transformed intozig-1or Col-0 WT by the floral dip method (Clough and Bent, 1998). Chemical stocks and treatments All chemical treatments used 4-d-old seedlings unless otherwise specified. Stock solutions of 3.3 mM wortmannin (Sigma-Aldrich), 200 μM latrunculin B (Lat-B; Sigma-Aldrich), and 2 mM oryzalin (Sigma-Aldrich) were made in 100% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and diluted to working concentrations in liquid AGM as 1% (v/v) DMSO, 33 μM Wm, 2 μM Lat-B and 20 μM oryzalin. Vacuole fusion assays were carried out by incubating seedlings in either DMSO or Wm for 90 min to 2 h before rinsing in diH2O and imaging. Lugol solution was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (62650). Staining was carried out by submerging Col-0 WT seedlings in solution for 20 min, while maintaining their growth orientation. Next, they were washed in diH2O for 10 min before they were mounted on microscope slides. A Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope with a ×40 water objective (1.1 NA) or ×20 objective (0.8 NA) was used for confocal microscopy. The excitation/emission wavelengths during acquisition were 488 nm/492–557 nm for GFP, and 516 nm/582–670 nm for mCherry. TVSs were counted as previously described (Hanet al., 2015). Briefly, hypocotyls were imaged in 600 μm thick optical sections using a ×20 (0.8 NA) objective to capture the volume of entire cells. Vacuolar membrane folds were counted as TVSs if they were formed by a double membrane, even if they did not transverse the entire vacuole in theXYplane. A centrifuge microscope was used for hypergravity experiments as previously described (Toyotaet al., 2013a,b). Four-day-old etiolated seedlings were mounted in a chamber to fix the specimen on the centrifuge microscope before rotation; 10gwas applied after 10–20s of imaging and held continuously for 60s. Quantification of organelle movement Tracking amyloplast movement was performed with the MTrackJ plugin of ImageJ. Amyloplast movement was quantified capturing time-lapse images for 3 min at 10 s intervals, but only amyloplasts that could be traced throughout all frames were scored. Seedlings were 4 d old for all experiments. Thex,ycoordinates of each amyloplast were recorded from each image. Then, the change in position in thex(Δx) andy(Δy) axes were determined and plotted in a coordinate graph. A stationary reference point such as the corner of a cell was used to correct for stage drift. Tracking of amyloplasts during hypergravity experiments was carried out with G-Track spot-tracking software (G-Angstrom, Japan) as described (Toyotaet al., 2013a). Gravitropism assay and hypocotyl curvature Col-0 WT andzig-1were sown on AGM, wrapped in foil to simulate dark, and oriented vertically for 3 d. All subsequent transfers took place in a dark room using a green safe light. Wm treatment was carried out by first aligning seedlings to the first gravity vector (g1) before placing an AGM dot containing either 1% (v/v) DMSO or 33 μM Wm on the top or bottom of the seedlings. For cytoskeleton inhibitor treatments, seedlings were transferred to fresh plates containing DMSO, 2 μM Lat-B or 20 μM oryzalin, and aligned tog1. Plates were wrapped in foil after transfers, rotated 90°, and scanned after another 20 h in the dark. ImageJ was used to measure hypocotyl curvature as the angle between the top of the hypocotyl andg1. All experiments were repeated at least three times. Statocytes in etiolated hypocotyls are restricted to young cells below the apical hook Amyloplast sedimentation in shoots has been well characterized by live-cell microscopy in inflorescence stems (Moritaet al., 2002;Saitoet al., 2005;Toyotaet al., 2013b) but not in seedlings. In order to characterize mechanisms of gravity perception in seedlings, we first quantified amyloplast sedimentation in wild-type (WT) hypocotyl endodermal cells by Lugol staining (Fig. 1A). When cells from the upper portion of the hypocotyl were imaged, 97.8% of the amyloplasts were found sedimented in the direction of gravity. However, only 9.5% of amyloplasts were observed at the bottom of the cell when cells were imaged further down the hypocotyl. This result suggests that amyloplast sedimentation may be restricted to endodermal cells just below the apical hook. Graviperceptive cells are located just below the shoot apex. (A) Endodermal cells below the apical hook contain sedimented amyloplasts. Col-0 WT seedlings were stained with Lugol solution and imaged on a compound microscope while maintaining a vertical orientation. The insets show representative cells from the region just below the apical hook (top) or a region towards the middle of the hypocotyl (bottom). Percentages under the insets represent the proportion of amyloplasts found at the bottom of cells in each region of the hypocotyl.n=88 amyloplasts from 23 cells and three seedlings. Arrowheads indicate the position of amyloplasts. Scale bar: 100 μm. (B) Increase of cell length along the hypocotyl endodermis. Dark-grown Col-0 WT seedling expressingpSCR::TIP1;1-GFPwere imaged by confocal microscopy. Average length of cells between the arrowhead marks is shown. Cell length data also include seedlings stained with Lugol solution and imaged by bright-field.n=7 seedlings. Scale bar: 100 μm. (C) Amyloplasts get trapped between vacuoles inzig-1endodermis. Endodermal cells near the shoot meristem of Col-0 WT (Col-0) andzig-1seedlings expressingpSCR::TIP1;1-GFPwere imaged by bright-field and confocal microscopy. Arrowheads mark the position of amyloplasts. Insets show the association between tonoplast and amyloplast. Scale bar: 20 μm. We measured cell length along the upper hypocotyl endodermis to better understand the potential transition between statocytes and non-statocytes. Cell length was estimated from bright-field images of Lugol-stained WT, as well as confocal images of a GFP-tagged vacuolar marker exclusively expressed in the endodermis (pSCR::TIP-1;1-GFP,Fig. 1B). Cell length varied from 23 ± 3.69 to 94 ± 0.82 μm in this region when measured from the apical hook to ~1 mm towards the root, but on average, only cells with length <70 μm showed sedimented amyloplasts. Using amyloplast sedimentation as a marker for the ability to perceive gravity, the small cells at the top of the hypocotyl are more likely to correspond to the shoot statocytes. Given this result, all subsequent experiments described below were conducted with endodermal cells between 30 and 70 μm in length within this region of the hypocotyl. The dynamic behavior of endodermal amyloplasts is restricted inzig-1 Amyloplast dynamics in hypocotyl endodermal cells before and after gravity reorientation. (A) Schematic representation of the rotation experiment. The orientation of the seedling with respect to gravity (g) before and after rotation is shown. Displacement of an amyloplast (gray circle) during a 3 min time lapse is shown with a pink arrow, and is expressed as a change in the horizontal position (Δx) and the vertical position (Δy). Positive values correspond to right and down and negative values correspond to left and up. (B, C) Amyloplast movements before and after rotation. A representative cell from the endodermis of Col-0 WT (B) orzig-1(C) is shown before (0–3 min) or after (rotation) a 90° rotation. Images correspond to the amyloplast positions at the start (0m) or the end (3m) of a 3 min time lapse. Tracks of representative amyloplasts are shown as different colored lines at the right of each panel. Arrowheads indicate one to two amyloplasts. Scale bar: 15 μm. (D, E) Quantification of amyloplast movements in WT andzig-1before and after rotation. Coordinate graph showing amyloplast displacement between 0 and 3 min in Col-0 WT (D) orzig-1(E).

Hypergravity does not displace amyloplasts in thezig-1mutant. (A) Hypergravity (10g) was applied either longitudinally or perpendicularly to 4-d-old dark grown WT andzig-1seedlings. Amyloplast localization was imaged by bright-field. Amyloplasts in WT relocate to the gravity associated bottom of the cell within 1 min of hypergravity; however, amyloplast movement inzig-1is much more restricted. Scale bar: 20 μm. (B) The velocity of amyloplast movement in Col-0 and zig-1 was analysed under the 10gconditions. Data are shown as means and error bars represent standard error.

Wortmannin-induced vacuolar membrane fusion releases endodermal amyloplasts inzig-1 Wortmannin treatment enhances amyloplast dynamics inzig-1hypocotyls. (A) Representation of the rotation experiment showing the orientation of the seedling with respect to gravity throughout the experiment. Displacement of an amyloplast (grey circle) during a 3 min time lapse is shown with a pink arrow, and is expressed as a change in the horizontal (Δx) and the vertical (Δy) position. Positive values correspond to displacement to the right and down while negative values correspond to displacement towards the left and up. Seedlings were incubated vertically in the presence of 33 μM Wm and imaged immediately for 3 min (top, 3–8 min). Another 3 min time lapse was captured after 90 min of Wm treatment (middle, 90–93 min), and finally, seedlings were rotated 90° and a 3 min time lapse was captured immediately (bottom, rotation). (B, C) Amyloplast movements after a Wm treatment. A representative cell from the endodermis of Col-0 WT (B) orzig-1(C) was imaged immediately after Wm treatment (3–8 min), 90 min after Wm treatment (90–93min) or 90 min after Wm treatment and a 90° rotation (rotation). Images correspond to the amyloplast positions at the start (0m) or the end (3m) of a 3 min time lapse. Tracks of representative amyloplasts are shown as different colored lines at the right of each panel. Arrowheads indicate one to two amyloplasts. Scale bar: 15 μm. (D, E) Quantification of amyloplast movements in WT andzig-1after Wm treatment. Coordinate graph showing amyloplast displacement between 0 and 3 min of each time lapse in Col-0 WT (D) orzig-1(E). Time lapse experiments were carried out within 3–8 min of Wm treatment (blue triangle), after 90 min of Wm treatment before rotation (orange crosses), or after 93 min of Wm treatment followed by a 90° rotation (yellow circles).n=110 amyloplasts from four seedlings of Col-0;n=98 amyloplasts from four seedlings ofzig-1. Quantification of amyloplast movements during these experiments indicated that amyloplast saltatory motion in WT was large (up to 20 μm) and showed no obvious bias in direction shortly after Wm treatment (Fig. 4D, 3–8 min). However, Wm treatment for 90 min restricted amyloplast movement in WT to within 10 μm of their initial position (Fig. 4D, 90–93 min). Again, most amyloplasts were able to translocate to the new gravity-associated bottom of the cell following the reorientation (Fig. 4D, rotation). In contrast, Wm treatment ofzig-1mutants had dramatic effects on amyloplast movement. Initially,zig-1amyloplast movement was highly restricted to within 5 μm of their starting position immediately after Wm application (Fig. 4E, 3–8 min) in a similar fashion to untreated seedlings (Fig. 2C). However, after 90 min their range of motion had increased to within 10 μm, and sometimes up to 17 μm from their original position (Fig. 4E, 90–93 min). After rotation, several amyloplasts were able to relocate to the bottom of the cell and move up to 30 μm (Fig. 4E, rotation). These data confirm that altering vacuolar membrane morphology has profound effects on amyloplast movement inzig-1. Wortmannin treatment ofzig-1statocytes partially restores gravitropism Local Wm application at the top of hypocotyls enhances gravitropism ofzig-1. Three-day-old seedlings from Col-0 WT andzig-1were treated at either the top or the bottom of the hypocotyl with a dot of AGM containing DMSO or 33 μM Wm. Seedlings were then exposed to a 90° rotation, and the angle of hypocotyl curvature was measured after 20 h. (A) Illustrations showing the placement of medium dots containing DMSO or Wm at either the top or the bottom of hypocotyls, the angle of hypocotyl curvature between the first gravity vector (g1) and the top of the hypocotyl, and how the angle distributions are represented. (B) Application of Wm at the top of the hypocotyl enhanceszig-1gravitropism. Shown are the angle distributions for WT andzig-1treated with DMSO or Wm at the top of the hypocotyl (n=87–112). (This figure is available in color atJXBonline.) Loss ofVTI11has dramatic consequences for endoplasmic reticulum organization Vacuoles and amyloplasts associate by cytoskeleton-independent mechanisms F-actin is involved in amyloplast saltatory movements in wild-type (Saitoet al., 2005;Yamamoto and Kiss, 2002), and it may function as a negative regulator of sedimentation (Nakamuraet al., 2011), but its specific role in the gravity response is unknown (Blancaflor, 2013). Because amyloplasts appear trapped between fragmented vacuoles inzig-1(Fig. 1) and are relatively static (Fig. 2), it was important to investigate if F-actin or microtubules were involved in restricting their movement. The cytoskeleton was visualized using the F-actin marker ABD2-GFP (Wanget al., 2004) or microtubule (MT) marker TUA6-GFP (Uedaet al., 1999) in cortical and medial sections of epidermal cells (Fig. 7). F-actin cables were observed at the cortex inzig-1(Fig. 7C) similar to the WT (Fig. 7A), except that the F-actin network surrounds the fragmented vacuoles inzig-1(Fig. 7C). We conclude that the fragmented vacuoles inzig-1do not impede F-actin polymerization or cortical arrangement. Similarly, microtubules were detected in the cell cortex in WT (Fig. 7E) andzig-1(Fig. 7G). However, dense MT arrays were also observed close to juxtaposing vacuoles (Fig. 7H). Overall, the lack of a central vacuole inzig-1does not appear to cause aggregates or abnormalities in the composition of the cytoskeletal network, except that both polymers are found surrounding thezig-1vacuoles. The cytoskeleton organization at the cortex is not affected inzig-1. Four-day-old seedlings from Col-0 WT (A, B, E, F) orzig-1(C, D, G, H) expressing ABD2-GFP to label F-actin (A–D) or TUA6-GFP to label microtubules (E–H) were imaged by confocal microscopy. Both cortical sections (A, C, E, G) and medial sections (B, D, F, H) for a representative cell are shown. Seedlings were grown in the dark. Arrowheads indicate zones with cytoskeleton enrichment that are found above juxtaposing vacuoles. Scale bar: 20 μm. (This figure is available in color atJXBonline.) Neither lantrunculin B (Lat B) nor oryzalin treatment suppresses the agravitropic phenotype ofzig-1. Gravitropism assay with Col-0 WT andzig-1in the presence of cytoskeleton inhibitors. Seedlings were grown vertically for 3 d in the dark, and then transferred to AGM plates containing 1% (v/v) DMSO (A, B), 2 μM Lat-B (A) or 20 μM oryzalin (B). Plates were returned to the dark and oriented at 90° from the original gravity vector (g1). After 20 h the angle of hypocotyl curvature was measured betweeng1 and the top of the hypocotyl. The distribution of seedlings in each degree class is indicated.n=77–100. Wm enhances graviresponse ofvti11alleles through dynamic TVS formation We have demonstrated that immobile amyloplasts inzig-1hypocotyls increase dynamic movements after Wm treatments. We then quantified transvacuolar strands (TVSs) in hypocotyls of WT anditt3before and after Wm treatment (Fig. 9A) to test whether this enhanced motion is due to vacuolar membrane remodeling through changes in TVS formation. The parental line showed 3.07 ± 0.22 TVSs per cell in hypocotyl epidermis, whileitt3mutants had only 0.22 ± 0.04 TVSs when DMSO treatments were used (Fig. 9B). The number of TVSs increased to 4.17 ± 0.10 in the parental line and to 1.60 ± 0.05 foritt3when seedlings were treated with Wm for 2 h. The significant increase in the number of TVSs after Wm treatment for both the parental line anditt3suggests that Wm not only promotes vacuole fusion, but has a positive effect on vacuole membrane dynamics as well. Wm treatment induces the formation of transvacuolar strands (TVSs). (A) Thick optical sections were captured for TVS quantification at low magnification. Example images used from WT anditt3hypocotyls are shown for both DMSO and Wm treatments. The types of TVS that were counted are indicated with arrowheads. Note that membranes that fully surrounded a vacuole initt3were not included (arrows). (B) Average number of TVSs per cell in parental anditt3.n=60 cells total from four seedlings per genotype. Mean values are statistically significant (Student’sttest, two tailed,P≤0.05) if letters are different. Here, we used live-cell imaging to analyse the dynamics of amyloplast sedimentation in Arabidopsis hypocotyls from whole seedlings. Previous studies have utilized cuttings from inflorescence stems (Moritaet al., 2002;Saitoet al., 2005;Toyotaet al., 2013b). Our microscope set-up allowed us to image endodermis through the almost transparent cortex of etiolated hypocotyls using a fluorescence microscope. A very small amount of Immersol allowed us to use a water immersion objective on the vertical stage, which provided optimal resolution. This unique set-up allowed us to track amyloplast sedimentation in real time and in whole plants without the concerns of plant injury. The system is amenable for cell biology analysis, including treatment with chemical inhibitors, and long-term time-lapse experiments. Furthermore, this system can overcome the challenges of imaging using stem cuttings, which have been shown to affect the vacuole morphology of certain mutants (Hashiguchiet al., 2014). One caveat of our system is the need to illuminate the seedlings during image acquisition, which we have addressed with a green filter to minimize phototropic responses. Green light, however, has been shown to enhance hypocotyl growth and inhibit blue and red phototropic responses in dark-grown seedlings (Folta, 2004;Folta and Maruhnich, 2007;McCoshum and Kiss, 2011). Therefore, experiments in the vertical stage must be interpreted with caution as they may be influenced by effects of the green light on seedling growth. Restriction of amyloplast sedimentation inzig-1is dependent on its vacuole phenotype A role for the vacuole in gravity perception or response is well documented (Moritaet al., 2002;Yanoet al., 2003;Saitoet al., 2005). TheVTI11loss of function mutantsgr4/zig-1was originally identified for its agravitropic phenotype in shoots (Yamauchiet al., 1997;Katoet al., 2002), and it was later shown to display abnormal vacuole morphology and reduced vacuole fusion (Zhenget al., 2014b). We usedzig-1and a second allele,itt3, as tools to interrogate the role of vacuole dynamics on gravitropism in Arabidopsis hypocotyls. As expected, WT endodermal cells from hypocotyl statocytes show a large central vacuole and sedimented amyloplasts that appeared surrounded by tonoplast membrane. This organization is very similar to that found in inflorescence stems (Moritaet al., 2002). In contrast, and consistent with other tissues (Zhenget al., 2014a,b), smaller unfused vacuoles were detected in endodermal statocytes fromzig-1mutants, where the amyloplasts were found distributed almost randomly throughout the cell. In these cells, amyloplasts appeared trapped at the junction of juxtaposing vacuoles, and this organization seems to prevent amyloplast movement inzig-1, both before and after gravistimulation, as depicted by time-lapse experiments. Surprisingly, conditions of hypergravity up to 10gwere not sufficient to force amyloplasts to sediment in these cells. It is unlikely that the fragmented vacuoles alone would be sufficient to prevent the movement of these organelles simply by creating physical obstacles to their movements along the cytosolic space. Therefore, we propose that a physical tether exists between the vacuole and amyloplasts that is of sufficient strength to resist a 10gforce. In fact in the case ofzig-1, each amyloplast seems attached to multiple vacuoles, which perhaps generates a strong physical tethering structure to resist this hypergravity pull. In contrast, hypergravity is known to increase amyloplast sedimentation and gravitropic curvature of other agravitropic mutants such assgr2,sgr9, andpgm(Toyotaet al., 2013b), but none of these mutants displays a fragmented vacuole phenotype. Amyloplast sedimentation has been shown to occur via transvacuolar strands (Moritaet al., 2002;Saitoet al., 2005), and therefore we asked whether the fragmented vacuole phenotype ofzig-1could impair TVS formation. In fact,zig-1mutants formed very few TVS structures in epidermal cells when compared with the WT, which could contribute to the reduced sedimentation of amyloplasts inside their statocytes. This possibility is consistent with the phenotype of thesgr2mutant, which displays fewer TVSs than WT and is agravitropic (Moritaet al., 2002;Saitoet al., 2005). Treatment with Wm induces fusion and restores the vacuole morphology ofzig-1(Zhenget al., 2014a,b). We used this assay to test whether the vacuole morphology phenotype ofzig-1was necessary for their lack of amyloplast sedimentation and the role of vacuole morphology on this movement. As expected, Wm treatment increased amyloplast sedimentation inzig-1. The Wm-induced vacuole fusion may have this effect due to the following: (i) vacuole fusion could disrupt the putative tethers between amyloplasts and the vacuolar membrane proposed above and therefore increase mobility of these organelles; (ii) vacuole fusion could restore the ability to form TVSs, which could become conduits for amyloplast sedimentation; (iii) restoring the single vacuole phenotype could remove physical obstacles formed by the vacuoles themselves. We indeed confirmed that Wm-induced vacuole fusion increases the formation of TVSs in epidermal cells. However, TVSs alone are probably not sufficient becausesgr2mutants, which do not form TVSs in stems, were able to reposition amyloplasts along a hypergravity vector (Toyotaet al., 2013b). Future research is needed to address the role of a putative tethering system to determine if all three possibilities play a role in this response. The alternate possibility that Wm is actually affecting gravitropism through effects on cellular events unrelated to vacuolar function seems less likely as Wm action on gravity response is not seen in WT plants where these other sites of action would presumably still be present.
