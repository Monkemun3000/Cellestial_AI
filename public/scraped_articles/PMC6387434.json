Space radiation has recently been considered a risk factor for astronauts’ cardiac health. As an example, for the case of how to query and identify datasets within NASA’s GeneLab database and demonstrate the database utility, we used an unbiased systems biology method for identifying key genes/drivers for the contribution of space radiation on the cardiovascular system. This knowledge can contribute to designing appropriate experiments targeting these specific pathways. Microarray data from cardiomyocytes of male C57BL/6 mice followed-up for 28 days after exposure to 900 mGy of 1 GeV proton or 150 mGy of 1 GeV/n56Fe were compared to human endothelial cells (HUVECs) cultured for 7 days on the International Space Station (ISS). We observed common molecular pathways between simulated space radiation and HUVECs flown on the ISS. The analysis suggestsFYNis the central driver/hub for the cardiovascular response to space radiation: the known oxidative stress induced immediately following radiation would only be transient and would upregulateFYN, which in turn would reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, protecting the cardiovascular system. The transcriptomic signature of exposure to protons was also much closer to the spaceflight signature than56Fe’s signature. To our knowledge, this is the first time GeneLab datasets were utilized to provide potential biological indications that the majority of ions on the ISS are protons, clearly illustrating the power of omics analysis. More generally, this work also demonstrates how to combine animal radiation studies done on the ground and spaceflight studies to evaluate human risk in space. Long-duration space travel has been associated with a number of human health risk factors, such as space radiation, microgravity, isolation, and hypoxia [1,2,3,4]. It is now thought that the two main factors driving the majority of the health risks are space radiation and microgravity, with space radiation being the main component for health risk for space missions beyond low Earth orbit (LEO) [5,6,7,8,9,10]. The different organs and related health issues potentially induced by these two aspects of the space environment are continuously studied and updated. Radiation-induced late cardiovascular disease in astronauts is one increasingly prominent concern [7,18,19,20]. Although many experiments using low-LET radiation have been conducted to show damage to the microvasculature, HZE particle data are limited, and the implications for disease risk need more study. There have been even fewer ground-based studies of the synergistic effects of space radiation and microgravity, which more closely mimic the environment in space. Data from atomic bomb survivors, albeit with different types of radiation, on increased incidence of cardiovascular disease have shown long-lasting effects decades after radiation exposure impacting increased ischemic heart disease, hypertension, and stroke with doses as low as 2 Gy [21,22,23]. Animal and cell culture models have been used to simulate HZE particle and proton radiation and have shown that low doses of high-LET radiation can drastically affect the cardiovascular system [7,20,24,25,26,27,28]. Specifically, one experiment showed that mice exposed to 0.1 Gy of 150 MeV protons or 0.5 Gy of 600 MeV/n iron ions (56Fe) experienced large changes in cardiac DNA methylation with potential impacts including heart failure and cardiomyopathy [29].56Fe is the most predominant HZE particle in the GCRs, and is a commonly used surrogate for GCR HZE. Other experiments have shown that cells and animal models exposed to proton and HZE radiation increase DNA oxidation, myocardial fibrosis, endothelial dysfunction, and vascular damage [24,27,28,30]. Although these experiments and data have contributed to the overall knowledge of cardiovascular disease risk from space travel, there are many potential confounding factors besides space radiation (e.g., stress, hypoxia, microgravity). Therefore, our overall understanding of the contribution of space radiation in cardiovascular disease risk and their mechanisms remain an open question. To further pursue the cardiovascular impact due to space radiation we utilized publicly available transcriptomic data that is available on NASA’s GeneLab platform (genelab.nasa.gov) [17] related to cardiovascular disease and the space environment. NASA’s GeneLab platform is a resource available to the public that has provided the first comprehensive omics database related to space. Due to the limited omics data available related to space radiation and cardiovascular disease, we analyzed two datasets from ground experiments designed to characterize the long-term impact following space irradiation (protons and56Fe) on cardiomyocytes for five different time-points up to 28 days after irradiation and one spaceflight experiment studying the impact of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) cultivated in the space environment on the ISS for seven days. Two components that make up the cardiac tissue are cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells and both cell types are heavily involved with cardiac remodeling and regeneration [31]. Although there are more components to the cardiac tissue, from the datasets available from the GeneLab related to the cardiovascular system, we will only focus on these components. Using these datasets, we hypothesized that there are common long-term molecules and pathways modulating the cardiovascular system due to radiation effects during spaceflight. Using a systems biology approach, we were able to suggest a novel mechanism through the FYN pathway [32,33,34,35] that the cardiovascular system uses to reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels when exposed to space radiation. Briefly, FYN is a member of the Src family of tyrosine kinases that has been previously shown to be heavily involved with the cardiovascular system through cardiomyocyte remodeling [36,37] and also leads to activation due to ROS [32,33,38,39]. In addition to FYN’s involvement with the cardiovascular system, it has also been reported to be a tumor suppressor [40,41], a key player in controlling immune receptor signaling status and inflammation [42], and has been shown to affect myelination of the central nervous system through crosstalk with Erk1/2 signaling [43]. For our findings, although the ROS levels are reduced through Fyn signaling, we show the potential of other pathways that will still contribute to increased cardiovascular risk in the space environment such as increased inflammation. In addition, we are able to suggest that HUVEC cells grown on the ISS in LEO show a molecular response that is in agreement with responses observed on Earth with simulated protons but with less commonality with heavier HZE ions, as one would expect from the predominance of protons found in LEO space radiation. This finding is critical as it highlights the relevance of simulated space radiation experiments conducted on Earth, as they are shown here as able to recapitulate what is observed in space. This work illustrates the power of unbiased omics analysis and how the GeneLab database has become an essential tool to better characterize the response of a life to space environment. More generally, these novel findings have potential to contribute to current cardiovascular risk models for spaceflight. 2.1. Global Analysis of Simulated Space Radiation Ground Experiments Compared to Spaceflight Samples Global transcriptome analysis comparing experimental conditions to the controls for ground space radiation experiments and spaceflight experiment. The datasets analyzed were GeneLab Dataset (GLDS)-117 for cardiomyocytes isolated from C57BL/6 irradiated with whole body 900 mGy of proton at 1 GeV, GLDS-109 for cardiomyocytes isolated from C57BL/6 irradiated with whole body 150 mGy of56Fe at 1 GeV/n, and GLDS-52 for Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs) incubated on the International Space Station (ISS) for 7 days (estimated dose 1.5 mGy, seeSection 2.2). (A–C) Principal component analysis (PCA) of all conditions for each dataset for genes. The percentage variance is shown for each principal component (PC) in parenthesis next to the PC axis. (D–F) Heat maps representing hierarchical clustering of significantly regulated genes by complete linkage and Euclidean distance calculation for datasets and conditions. 2.2. Dose Received by HUVECs Flown in Space The data are from the European Space Agency-Integrated Experiment (ESA-SPHINX) experiment (10/31/10–11/6/10) [44]. The cells were launched to the ISS on a Russian Progress supply vehicle, cultured for 7 days in the KUBIK incubator on the European Space Agency (ESA) Columbus module, and then fixed. To be able to compare the dose received on the ISS to the simulated radiation ground studies, we obtained dose data from a detector located on the Columbus. (Data provided kindly by T. Berger from the German Aerospace Center (DLR)). The measured dose rate was almost constant throughout the experiment with an average of 220.43 µGy/day (in water) with a standard deviation of 1.90 µGy/day (in water) measured over the period of the experiment (Data provided kindly by T. Berger from the DLR and additional details can be found in the original publication [44]). The total dose was 1.544 mGy (in water) with the dose equivalent to 3.7 mSv, of which 58% was from high-energy protons and other GCR ions, and 42% from low-energy protons in the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA). The actual dose to the samples was probably somewhat lower, as they were shielded by the incubator. Here it is important to make the distinction between particle energy and LET, which is essentially energy loss per unit path length and is proportional to the square of the charge. Linear energy transfer (LET) is a measure of how ionizing a particle is; because they are singly charged, both high- and low-energy protons are relatively low LET. 2.3. Common Pathways between Simulated Space Radiation and Spaceflight Samples Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) emphasizing the hallmark gene sets commonly enriched in cardiomyocytes of irradiated animals or HUVECs flown in space. (A) Common Hallmark gene sets enriched in spaceflight samples and irradiated samples. The majority of these datasets are downregulated. (B) Hallmark gene sets that are oppositely regulated between all irradiated samples and the spaceflight samples. (C) Hallmark gene sets commonly enriched in cardiomyocytes of animals irradiated with 1 GeV/n proton or HUVECs flown in space. Note, most of them are upregulated. (D) Hallmark gene sets commonly enriched in cardiomyocytes of animals irradiated with 1 GeV/n56Fe or HUVECs flown in space. Note, most of them are downregulated for56Fe and spaceflight samples. Note: all samples were comparing experimental conditions with the respective controls. For figures (C,D), the common wedges are highlighted in yellow outline. The significant gene sets were determined with false discovery rate (FDR) ≤ 0.05. The legend in the middle of the figure displays what each component/wedge of the nodes represent. Each node contains 11 wedges for each condition and the color of each wedge indicates if the gene set is downregulated (blue) or upregulated (red). The shade of the color indicates the degree of regulation. Each node represents one gene set and the size of the node indicates the number of genes involved with the predictions. Pathways with more than one node are grouped together in the black boxes under each major category. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) with the Reactome gene sets comparing different time-points after irradiation with either protons or56Fe with the HUVECs flown in the space. All samples were comparing experimental conditions with the respective controls. The significant gene sets were determined with FDR ≤ 0.05. Each node represents one gene set and the size of the node indicates the number of genes involved with the predictions. Each node contains 11 wedges for each condition and the color of each wedge indicates if the gene set is downregulated (blue) or upregulated (red). The shade of the color indicates degree of regulation. 2.4. The Biological Pathways Elicited by Protons Have Stronger Overlap with Spaceflight Samples Than Those Elicited by56Fe Ions Predicted functions and upstream regulators affected by space radiation for HUVECs exposed to the space environment and cardiomyocytes from mice exposed to protons and56Fe ion irradiation with multiple time-points after irradiation. The predicted statistically significant biofunctions (A), upstream regulators (B), and canonical pathways (C), determined through Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) from data for each individual dataset using activationZ-score statistics. Heat map representation of the activationZ-score values (red = positive activationZ-score for activation and blue = negative activationZ-score for inhibition) with hierarchical clustering by complete linkage and Euclidean distance calculation for datasets and conditions were used to display the data. The prevalence of change (or % of dataset) on the left side of the heat maps represents how common that factor is throughout all datasets/tissues with the darkest color representing factors with the highest degree in common. Time after irradiation, cell type, and experiment is color coded on the top of the heat maps. For all heat maps we are only showing the prevalence of change for the functions associated with the top 4 (i.e., a prevalence of change score ≥ 7). Global clustering of the biofunctions (D), upstream regulators (E), and canonical pathways (F) for all samples are shown by principal component analysis (PCA). For the PCA plots we used all functions for each datapoint regardless of the prevalence of change score. 2.5. Key Driving Genes Provide Direct Connection to ROS for Space Radiation Impact on the Cardiovascular System The key driving genes associated with space radiation and the predicted functions that these genes will affect. A circular network created with IPA is utilized connecting all the key genes from each experimental condition (i.e., common key genes for all time-points for both cardiomyocytes from mice irradiated with either 150 mGy56Fe or 900 mGy protons compared to 0 Gy controls and HUVECs flown in on the ISS for 7 days compared to the ground control). The color of the gene represents whether the gene is upregulated (red) or downregulated (green) with the shade signifying the degree of regulation. (A) The network of key genes done with analysis using all time-points and samples. (B) The network of key genes for analysis done with all time-points except for 7 and 28 days for56Fe vs Ctrl. For this analysis there were three key genes that overlapped between the cardiomyocytes irradiated with protons and56Fe (CD4,CD3G, andLCK). These were oppositely regulated between the two irradiation conditions and the colors in the top half indicate the gene expression for protons and the bottom indicates the gene expression for56Fe. The different line colors represent the predicted effect of each gene on each other. Predicted functional impact of the key genes were determined using IPA which allowed us to predict whether cardiac related functions were either inhibited (blue) or activated (orange). The identification of the symbols for each gene is shown on the bottom of the figure. 2.6. Predicted Circulating miRNA Signature Associated with Space Radiation Cardiovascular Risk The top 30 miRNAs associated with all the key genes determined by Cytoscape [70] plugin referred to as ClueGo [71]. 4.1. Datasets Utilized from the GeneLab Platform All data used for this manuscript were obtained from GeneLab (genelab.nasa.gov). The following datasets were used: GLDS-52, -109, and -117. Spaceflight mission and ground radiation experimental details for each dataset such as, the handling of the cells, RNA extraction, and raw data pertaining to the microarray can be found in the GeneLab database. Briefly, we used two ground studies utilizing cardiomyocytes isolated from 8 to 9 months old male C57BL/6NT mice that have been whole-body irradiated with either one acute dose of 900 mGy protons at 1 GeV (GLDS-117) or 150 mGy of iron ions (56Fe) at 1 GeV/n (GLDS-109) and 5 time-points up to 28 days were collected after irradiation [45]. For protons, the following time-points were used for transcriptomic analysis: 1 day (n= 2), 3 days (n= 3), 5 days (n= 2), 12 days (n= 2), and 26 days (n= 2). For56Fe, the following time-points were used for transcriptomic analysis: 1 day (n= 3), 3 days (n= 3), 7 days (n= 2), 14 days (n= 2), and 28 days (n= 2). For both experiments cardiomyocytes were also isolated from 0 Gy sham at the following time-points and data was pooled between all time-points for the controls: 1 day (n= 2) and 3 days (n= 1). All cardiomyocytes were isolated by microdissection from tissue dissections in order to remove other cell types. One spaceflight study was used that flew HUVECs to the ISS and the cells were exposed to space environment in vitro under standard conditions for 7 days before the cells were preserved in RNAlater [44]. The ground controls used for this study are 1 ×gcontrols that were grown on Earth with identical conditions compared to the cells on the ISS. Pathway analysis and subsequent predictions in each tissue were done using the statistically significant genes with a fold-change ≥1.2 (or ≤−1.2) comparing flight conditions versus ground controls or irradiated samples vs. unirradiated samples for ground experiments. Using a 1.2-fold-change cutoff allowed us to determine the impact of how major pathways were being regulated that would not be apparent with larger fold-change cutoffs. It was shown in the literature that larger fold-change values used for Omics data will significantly reduce useful biological data that becomes apparent when using lower fold-change cutoffs [82,83]. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software (Ingenuity Systems) was used to predict statistically significant activation or inhibition of upstream regulators, canonical pathways, biofunctions, and toxic functions using activationZ-score statistics (≥2, activated or ≤−2, inhibited) [84]. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was done using the C2, C5, and Hallmarks gene sets with a FDR ≤ 0.05 from the entire list of genes and additional leading edge analysis was performed as described by Subramanian et al. [46]. All heat maps and principal component analysis (PCA) plots were generated using packages available through R (pheatmap for heat maps and scatterplot3d for PCA plots). 4.3. Determination of Key Genes/Drivers We used a previously established unbiased systems biology method to determine key genes/drivers [54,56,57,59,60] for each tissue. Briefly, the standard method we have developed in the past to determine key genes was done by determining the overlapping genes involved in the predictions made through IPA’s upstream regulators, canonical pathways, biofunctions, and GSEA gene sets (C2, C5, and Hallmarks gene sets). The common genes identified through these statistically significant predictions can be thought of as the central drivers for the experiment being studied, since the absence of the genes will make these predictions null. In some cases, these overlaps result in either no key genes or a very low number of genes. If this occurs, we adjust the pathway predictions involved with the gene overlaps. For the key genes determined here, we were forced to show the overlapping genes that were only involved with the GSEA Hallmarks Gene Set analysis with the IPA predictions. To determine the key gene, which has the highest number of connections and can be thought of as the central hub for the set of key genes, we utilized IPA to define the total number of connections between all the key genes. Next, we plotted the genes using the radial plot tool which places the most connected gene in the center of the plot. Previous work involving similar statistically identified key genes provided experimental validation for this methodology using Western blots, qPCR, and other functional assays [56,60]. 4.4.
