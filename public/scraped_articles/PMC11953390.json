  "content": "Identification of therapeutic targets for chronic kidney disease through Mendelian randomization analysis of druggable genes Received 2024 Sep 14; Accepted 2025 Mar 17; Collection date 2025. Subject terms:Data mining, Drug discovery, Genetics, Nephrology Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a progressive condition affecting over 800 million individuals globally1. It is defined by a persistent estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m² body surface area, or urinary albumin excretion equal to or greater than 30 mg/day, or both, sustained for a duration exceeding three months2. Historically, the management of CKD primarily focused on delaying renal failure, implementing end-stage dialysis, or pursuing renal transplantation3. However, recent advancements in the field have led researchers to explore pharmacological interventions, such as empagliflozin, which has shown promise in decelerating CKD progression and mitigating cardiovascular risks associated with the condition4. Despite advancements in medical research, effective treatments for CKD remain elusive. Consequently, the identification and exploration of novel drug targets for CKD treatment are imperative. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), which are single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that influence gene expression levels, present a promising avenue for this endeavor. Utilizing MR analysis of druggable genes, cis-eQTLs—SNPs located in the proximal genomic regions of target genes and closely associated with their expression—serve as instrumental variables (IVs) to elucidate causal relationships between druggable genes and CKD. This approach facilitates the identification of potential drug targets for CKD treatment. This approach has also found extensive application in the investigation of various other diseases5–7. Mendelian Randomization (MR), a statistical technique that leverages genetic variation as an instrumental variable, has demonstrated significant potential in recent years for causal inference in the context of complex diseases8. By utilizing genetic variants that exhibit strong correlations with exposure factors as IVs, MR facilitates the assessment of causal relationships between exposure factors and outcomes, thereby mitigating the influence of confounding variables. Consequently, MR analyses is frequently employed to evaluate etiological inferences in epidemiological research9,10. Importantly, the effectiveness of MR analyses parallels that of randomized controlled trials, albeit with reduced bias and the elimination of reverse causality (Fig.1)11. The principle of Mendelian randomization analysis is shown in the figure, where instrumental variables can represent exposure (druggable gene), are independent of confounding factors, and do not directly affect outcomes (Chronic kidney disease). In this MR analysis, we selected cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTL) of druggable genes as the exposure variable and employed genome-wide association study (GWAS) data for CKD from the FinnGen database as the outcome variable. This approach was designed to elucidate the complex relationship between the expression of druggable genes and CKD. To identify the most suitable SNPs as instrumental variables, we conducted association analyses of the exposure factors and established stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria. A series of sensitivity analyses was implemented in order to ensure the robustness and reliability of the MR analysis. Furthermore, to elucidate the functional roles of the significant genes identified through MR analysis in terms of cellular composition, biological processes, and molecular functions, as well as to interpret the biological pathways they are involved in according to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), we performed comprehensive functional annotations. We conducted Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG enrichment analyses on these significant genes, and provided detailed information regarding their chromosomal positions. Additionally, we performed colocalization analysis to evaluate whether cis-eQTL and CKD share the same causal variants. The overall design idea is detailed in Fig.2. The overall design of this study is shown in the figure. FinnGen is a well-known and large database, and FinnGen provides genetic insights from a phenotypically well-defined and isolated population14. The CKD outcome data were derived from the FinnGen database, which collected information on 447,473 individuals, including 11,265 in the case group and 436,208 in the control group. Selection of instrumental variables Reliable and accurate instrumental variables are characterized by three distinctive features:1a very strong association with the exposure2, no relationship with confounders other than the exposure, and3the absence of horizontal pleiotropy. It is essential to note that horizontal pleiotropy should be entirely absent in MR analyses. To identify IVs meeting these criteria, we conducted a rigorous screening of each druggable gene. Initially, we performed association analyses to select SNPs from the cis-eQTL data, ensuring that only SNPs with P-values below the genome-wide significance threshold (5.0 × 10− 8) were considered. Secondly, to mitigate the knock-on disequilibrium effects of these SNPs, we utilized the “TwoSampleMR” package in the R programming language to set the linkage disequilibrium (LD) threshold to R² < 0.1, using data from the 1000 Genomes Project (EUR population) with an aggregation distance of 10,000 kb15. In addition, we calculated the proportion of variance explained (R2) and the F statistic to quantify the strength of the tool with the following equations: R2= 2 × MAF × (1 - MAF) × β2, and F = R2(n-k-1)/ k(1-R2), where “MAF” is the SNP used as the IV secondary allele frequency, “n” is the sample size, “k” is the number of IVs used16. To avoid weak IV bias, we selected SNPs with F > 10 as the IVs we analysed. Mendelian randomization analysis Gene function and pathway enrichment analysis GO is the world’s largest source of information on gene function. This knowledge is both human-readable and machine-readable, and is the basis for large-scale computational analyses20,21. KEGG is a database for understanding high-level functions and utilities of biological systems from molecular-level information22–24. For biological process and pathway enrichment analyses, KEGG and GO analyses were performed using the R “clusterProfiler” software package. Finally, the R “circlize” package was used25to display information on the location of these genes on the corresponding chromosomes. Twelve significant genes were identified by MR analysis of druggable genes The 12 druggable genes are closely related to the risk of CKD after FDR correction. If OR is greater than 1, the gene is considered to be positively correlated with the occurrence of CKD, and if it is less than 1, it is considered to be negatively correlated. FDR is the corrected p-value, and FDR is greater than 0.05, which is considered statistically significant. Colocalization analysis of 12 significant genes Demonstrate information about key genes on the corresponding chromosome This figure shows the relationship between significant genes and chromosome positions. For example, TUBB is located on chromosome 6. Analysis of specific biological processes, functional classes and signalling pathways corresponding to key genes by GO/KEGG enrichment Notably, TUBB was pathway linked to Cellular community - eukaryotes, Infectious disease/bacterial, and Cellular Processes. In GO enrichment analysis, TUBB was associated with natural killer cell mediated immunity, leukocyte mediated immunity, lymphocyte mediated immunity, primary lysosome, azurophil granule, nuclear envelope lumen, spindle, intercellular bridge, GTPase activating protein binding, MHC class I protein binding, and MHC protein binding and other related. In this study, we found that the expression of 12 genes was closely related to CKD. For genes demonstrating significant associations in the MR analysis, we performed a comprehensive suite of sensitivity analyses and functional assessments. These included Cochrane’s Q-test, MR-Egger regression, colocalization analysis, and GO and KEGG enrichment analyses. Our findings revealed a strong correlation between the expression of the TUBB gene and CKD. MR analysis of druggable genes, along with colocalization analysis, has yielded compelling evidence suggesting that TUBB is a potential therapeutic target for CKD. Microtubule-targeting agents (MTAs) developed based on β-tubulin proteins have a longstanding history and are considered among the earliest anti-cancer drugs30. For instance, compounds such as vincristine, vinblastine, and vindesine target the Vinca domain located at the inter-dimer interface between two longitudinally aligned tubulin dimers within the β-tubulin monomer32–34. Additionally, colchicine, benzimidazoles, and combretastatins interact with the colchicine binding sites situated in the deep pocket between αβ-tubulin dimers within β-tubulin monomers35. Furthermore, binding to the Taxane site of β-tubulin monomers in the inner lumen of MTs stabilizes the MT lattice. Consequently, MT-stabilizing agents such as paclitaxel and epoxomicin have been developed36. Secondly, Maytansine and Spongistatin interact near the Vinca site on the exposed pocket of β-tubulin37,38. Similarly, the compounds Laulimalide and Peloruside target β-tubulin protein pockets oriented towards the exterior of microtubules (MTs)39,40. In 2021, the Gatorbulin site was identified, located within the α-tubulin subunit, between α- and β-tubulin, and proximal to the colchicine site. This site functions to form a wedge between two longitudinally aligned MT dimers at the MT terminus41. Recently, a novel compound named Cevipabulin has been reported to bind to this pocket42. The numerous sites of targeted drug development, whether currently known or unknown, associated with TUBB present substantial opportunities for TUBB to be considered a potential drug target in CKD. The causal relationship established through MR analysis and CKD suggests new avenues for targeted drug research. In summary, our MR analysis indicates that TUBB may serve as a potential target for reducing CKD risk. Run-Sen Liang and Jin-Qi Su : Writing – original draft, Validation, Methodology, Data curation.
