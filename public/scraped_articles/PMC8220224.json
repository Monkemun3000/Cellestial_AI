Received 2021 Mar 1; Revised 2021 Apr 27; Accepted 2021 May 13; Collection date 2021 Jun. The spaceflight environment contains two major risk factors, irradiation and microgravity, which are thought to induce adverse effects on astronauts’ vision and central nervous systems,1–4and in particular, the eye and retina.5,6Studies reported that more than 30% of astronauts returning from Space Shuttle missions or the International Space Station (ISS) were diagnosed with eye problems that reduced visual acuity.3,7Furthermore, a recent study showed that spaceflight induced significant apoptosis in the retinal inner nuclear layer (INL) and ganglion cell layer (GCL) of mice.8Previous work has also shown that many genes involved in oxidative stress and mitochondria-associated apoptosis are altered in the retinas of space-flown mice, and oxidative stress-induced apoptosis plays an important role in response to space irradiation in mouse retinas.9–11 Previous research on space-induced visual impairment in astronauts has primarily utilized proteomics and microarray technologies to better understand the biological effects of spaceflight on the mouse retina; these studies collectively reveal that spaceflight alters the expression of certain genes and proteins involved in cell death, mitochondrial function, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, neuronal and glial cell loss, and axonal degeneration in mice.9,12Although there are studies analyzing the transcriptome in human retinas, none has been done under spaceflight conditions.13–16Thus, the mechanisms underlying the spaceflight-induced vision impairment remain largely unknown. Even though spaceflight-induced transcriptomic reprogramming in mouse retinas was recently reported,17there has been no study of the effects of spaceflight on the retina methylome or the epigenetic clocks of animals or humans. There is great enthusiasm both within the scientific community and society in general with the ambitious plans for the return of manned missions to the moon and long-duration (>300 days) space travel to Mars and beyond. However, a comprehensive assessment of the adverse effects on the human body is still incomplete. In a recent NASA Twins Study, some persistent changes in gene expression, DNA damage, telomeres, neuro-ocular and cognitive function were observed when comparing the spaceflight twin brother to his earth-bound twin.18It has also been shown that long-duration spaceflight changes gene regulation at both the transcriptional and epigenetic levels, although the majority of these changes return to the preflight level six months after returning to earth. As part of a NASA research consortium to accelerate spaceflight risk characterization and to gather omics data to allow robust predictions of cellular response in organisms exposed to long-duration spaceflight, we investigated the DNA methylome, epigenetic clock and transcriptome of retinas from mice flown on a long-duration 37-day mission, the human equivalent of 4.1 years, as part of the Rodent Research-1 (RR-1) project. We identified differentially methylated genes (DMGs) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between spaceflight and ground control mice. In addition, as epigenetic clocks have been used to predict tissue biological ages and age-related diseases in both humans19and mice20,21, we calculated spaceflight-induced epigenetic clock based on the DNA methylation at unique CpG sites of mouse retinas to predict the retinal tissue aging due to the spaceflight. This study provides new insights into the visual impairment due to long-duration spaceflight. Study design and overall QC of RRBS DNA methylome and RNA-seq transcriptome data Study design. This study was under the NASA Rodent Research-1 (RR-1) project consortium. Spaceflight mice after flight were euthanized and frozen on orbit. The retinas were isolated from both the ground habitat control and flight mice after returning to ground. RNA and DNA were extracted from the retinas, and then RRBS and RNA-seq libraries were constructed to obtain DNA methylome and transcriptome, respectively. Retinal epigenetic age was calculated using MouseEpigeneticClock script. Disease and bio-functional pathways were generated using the DAVID GO functional annotation and the Ingenuity Pathway through Analysis (IPA) based on DMGs & DEGs. Global epigenomic and transcriptomic changes in the retinas of spaceflight mice Overall, 31.2 million CpGs, ranging from 1.6 million to 2.1 million CpGs per sample, were used to study the genome-wide CpG methylation patterns in terms of the relationship to the genomic features. The profiling CpG methylation patterns revealed that the spaceflight mice were hypomethylated globally compared to ground mice (P= 0.034, two-tailed t-test, Fig.2A). A significant lower CpG methylation level was observed within CG islands compared to CpG shores in both ground and spaceflight mice (P< 2.2E−16, two-tailedt-test). In addition, the level of methylation was significantly higher in the introns compared to exons in both groups (P< 2.2E−16, two-tailedt-test). The methylation at the transcription starting site (TSS) had the lowest methylation compared to other genomic regions (promoter, exon and intron) in both spaceflight and ground mice. Furthermore, 62.5% of the 643 differentially methylated genes were hypomethylated and 37.5% were hypermethylated (Fig.2B). Annotation of differentially methylated CpGs (DMCs) revealed that a large portion of the DMCs were located in introns, followed by intergenic regions and exons. About 15% of the DMCs were located in promoters (Fig.2C). Principal component analysis (PCA) (Fig.2D) and hierarchial cluster analysis (HCA) (Fig.2E) based on DMCs showed a clear difference between spaceflight and ground control mice. Overall, the methylation data clearly demonstrated that spaceflight induced profound DNA methylation changes. Spaceflight caused global epigenomic changes in mouse retina.

(E) HCA plots based on DMCs. (F) Epigenetic ages calculated using Stubb's age estimator based on retinal methylomes. As DNA methylation has been successfully used to predict epigenetic clock—biological age,22we determined the epigenetic clocks of the retinas of spaceflight and control mice, using Stubbs’ epigenetic clock predictor.20The differences of Stubbs’ predicted biological ages between the spaceflight and ground control mice were tested using Welch's two-samplet-test, which showed a significant age deceleration in spaceflight mice relative to ground mice (1.7 vs. 2.4 weeks,P= 0.049 on two-tailedt-test) (Fig.2F). It is worth noting that the predicted epigenetic ages were much younger than the true chronological ages (21.2 weeks). Spaceflight induced global alterations on gene expression and the distribution of DMCs and DEGs across chromosomes. (A) Volcano plot showing significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs, fold change > 1.2 andP≤ 0.05). Red and blue triangle indicates the number of up-regulated or down-regulated DEGs, respectively. DEGs with more than 50% expression change are highlighted in red (up-regulated) and blue (down-regulated). (B) PCA using the spaceflight induced DEGs. The normalized expressions of 177 DEGs were used for PCA computation and no sample was filtered out. (C) HCA plots based on DEGs between spaceflight mouse retinas and ground controls. (D) Circos plot showing the distribution of DMCs and DEGs across chromosomes. Y chromosome was excluded as only female mice were used in the study. We further examined the alteration patterns due to the spaceflight on the DNA methylome and transcriptome across chromosomes using Circos plotting (Fig.3D). Despite that differentially methylated regioins (DMRs) were observed on each chromosome (chromosome Y was excluded as only female mice were used in this study), the DMRs were not evenly distributed across chromosome as well as at certain particular chromosome regions, suggesting that some chromosomes or regions were more prone to methylation modification. For instance, Chr X harbored the most DMRs, followed by Chr 4 and 7. In addition, some regions, e.g., Chr 4: 95 278 373–155 343 067 and Chr 2: 118 262 949–159 068 995, exhibited locally enriched DMRs. Although many DMRs were observed in certain chromosomes, e.g., Chr 2, 4, 5, 14, and X, there were fewer DEGs in these chromosomes (61 DMRs vs. 3 DEGs observed on Chr X; 30 DMRs vs. 14 DEGs observed on Chr 11), suggesting a differential or relatively less sensitive response in the gene expression of retinal tissue to spaceflight.

(C) Correlation between the gene expression and DNA methylation of different location of gene for the five overlapping genes. Blue, spaceflight mouse retina; orange, ground control mouse retina. In order to understand the regulatory role of DNA methylation on transcription, we performed Pearson correlation analysis between DNA methylation and gene expression at gene body level, using all CpGs annotated to the 5 overlapping genes (Fig.5C). Overall, there were mild to moderate correlations (|R| values between 0.3−0.7), nevertheless with no consistent trend between DNA methylation in the gene body and their gene expressions. For examples, in Col8a2 gene, a moderate positive correlation between DNA methylations at upstream 1 to 5 kb region (R = 0.49,P= 0.066) but a moderate negative correlation (R = −0.55,P= 0.0410) at exons with its gene expression were observed. InJunbgene, a moderate positive correlation (R = 0.68,P= 0.01) between DNA methylation at 5′ UTR and its gene expression was observed. InTsc22d3gene, a moderate negative correlation (R = −0.58,P= 0.019) was observed between DNA methylation at upstream 1 to 5 kb region and its gene expression. Weak negative correlations were observed between DNA methylations in all gene body regions ofMafand its gene expression, while weak positive correlations were observed between DNA methylations in all parts ofMid1ip1gene and its gene expression. Genes and pathways regulated by spaceflight at both transcription and DNA methylation levels Multi-dimensional genome-wide analyses have been applied to interrogate vision function, aging and diseases.4,24–26In this study, we characterized the retinal tissue epigenomic reprogramming, along with the transcriptomic changes of mouse retinas after a period of 37-day spaceflight, the human equivalent of 4.1 years. The differential gene expression analysis revealed a few distinctive yet interconnected pathways that may have been affected by spaceflight, such as inflammatory and cancer-prone pathways, i.e., interleukin and chemokine pathways (Fgfr1, Fos, Cxcr4genes); cell structure maintenance pathways, i.e., ECM and keratins; and the cell death, cell differentiation, and survival pathways, i.e., VEGF, TSP1, TGF-β signaling and DNA repair. These findings support the notion that environmental conditions during spaceflight, such as microgravity and space radiation, induce retinal structure damage and the counteractive cell response,9leading to similar conditions of known disease states such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD).16,27A recent study by Chenget al. showed that even though mice do not have macula, mimicking diseased photoreceptor metabolism profile in mice caused macular degeneration-like pathologies similar to that in humans and leading to blindness.28 Consistent with what has been reported on retinal disorders,14we identified six genes in the spaceflight mouse retinas that were associated with AMD (Adamts, Col8a, Htr, Igfb, Slc, Tgfbr). We also found that the mitochondrial small molecule transporter family genes such asSlc4a7, Slc6a17, Slc22a8, Slc22as, Slc25a2, andSlc31a2were among the top DEGs and DMGs induced by spaceflight in the mouse retinas. A gene expression change of a small molecule transporter in ocular tissue was also observed in a previous spaceflight study, which was linked to oxidative damage in leading to mitochondrial apoptosis and cell death in retina.9Many other structural proteins, such as collagen, keratin and actin, were also downregulated under spaceflight conditions. The suppression of these genes has been shown to trigger chronic inflammation, fibrosis, retinopathy, and cancer.29Notably, several genes in the retinoic acid metabolism pathway were hypermethylated in spaceflight mice. RA receptors repress the activity of transcription factors such asAP-1andNF-κB, and therefore have potential anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory effects. In addition, the expressions of several genes (Wnt5a, Vegf, andTnf) in the Wnt/β-catenin pathway were altered by spaceflight. Wnt/β-catenin pathway plays a pathogenic role in AMD, and it is believed that certain changes in AMD likely lead to inflammation or a cancer-like disease state.30 Intraocular pressure (IOP) impacts cell adhesion and connection, promotes detachment of cell from ECM, leading to apoptosis and optical nerve damage.31,32Our transcriptomic and epigenomic studies on spaceflight mouse retinas showed that ECM-receptor components were among the most altered genes in spaceflight mouse retinas relative to that in ground control mice (Table1). We found that the expression of myocilin (encoded byMyoc), a structural component that regulates IOP, was significantly suppressed, suggesting an adverse effect of microgravity on IOP regulation. Another significantly altered gene family in the spaceflight mouse retinas was simple epithelial keratins (SEKs), which are primarily expressed in single-layered simple epithelia. An important feature of SEKs is that one specific SEK pair (one type I SEK and one type II SEK) predominate in an epithelial cell where they form noncovalent heteropolymers.33Our transcriptomic data showed bothKrt1andKrt10were significantly upregulated, suggesting that the spaceflight mice might have been subject to some structural repair in the retinas. However, the expression of another corneal epithelial SEK, Krt12, was significantly suppressed. Beside its structural roles,Krt12is generally regarded as a specific corneal epithelial differentiation marker34and a reduced expression ofKrt12gene may suggest an impaired cell differentiation under spaceflight condition. The transcriptomic data revealed spaceflight down-regulated wound-healing and cell proliferation genes (Tgfb2, Tgfb3, Igfbp4, Igfbp5, Igfbp6, Pdgfra, andDcn) in mouse retinas. Furthermore, many transcriptional regulators were also downregulated in the spaceflight mouse retinas, including hormone-retinoid receptorsNr4a1andNr4a3, zinc finger transcriptional factorEgr1, connective tissue growth factorCtgf, and serine protease inhibitorsSerpine2, Serpinf1, Serpinh1andSerping. These transcriptional factors play critical roles in regulating cell survival, proliferation, axial eye growth,35morphogenesis of the lens and optic vesicle development.36,37The methylomic data also suggested that spaceflight may impact cell cycle and DNA repair as indicated by the IPA analysis-based DMGs, which showed that R-SMAD binding protein, TGF-β receptor signaling, and WNT signaling pathways were all enriched. The recent NASA Twins Study,18also showed that the gene expression changed for genes related to cell growth, proliferation and angiogenesis in CD4 and CD8 cells, indicating that the activation of wound-repairing pathways are not limited to retinal tissue in spaceflight. Figure1illustrates the overall study design. The 16-week-old female C57 BL/6J mice (Jackson Lab, Bar Harbor, ME) were used in this study as part of the NASA RR-1 project consortium. This project was approved by the NASA Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Both spaceflight and ground control animals were housed in NASA's animal enclosure modules (AEM), with control mice being exposed to the same environment conditions (12-hour light cycle, temperature and humidity) as those flown on the International Space Station (ISS). Control animals were kept inside an environmental simulator (ISSES) at the Space Life Science Laboratory (SLSL) at Kennedy Space Center (KSC), and the spaceflight animals were transported to the ISS by SpaceX4 on September 21, 2014. All animals were fed with a special NASA food bar diet and their health was checked daily. The spaceflight mice were euthanized and frozen on-orbit after 37 days of flight, while ground control mice were simultaneously euthanized and frozen under identical conditions. After the frozen carcasses were returned to KSC, the ocular tissues were removed from both groups. DNA and RNA were extracted from the same retinal sample and were used for library constructions using NuGEN Ovation®RRBS and Ovation®Mouse RNA-seq library construction kits, respectively. Libraries were multiplexed with unique sample indices, pooled, and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 550. FastQ files were subject to FastQC, adapter and low-quality reads trimming before mapping to mouse genome NCBI GRCm38. Differential CpG methylation regions and differential expressed genes were determined after mapping and counting, and the resulting DMR and DEG lists were subject to IPA and DAVID gene functional analysis. The epigenetic clock was determined using the MouseEpigeneticClock script developed by Stubbset al. (2017).20 Dissection and preservation of the mouse ocular samples At the time of dissections, both eyes were dissected from the carcasses thawed at room temperature for 15–20 minutes. The eyes were harvested and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, then stored at −80 °C. The frozen whole eye samples were micro-dissected in the ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Fine spring scissors were used to separate the cornea from the sclera to access the retina. The retina was carefully detached from the sclera. The retina, cornea, and lens were immediately frozen on dry ice and stored at −80°C before DNA and RNA isolations. Retinal tissues (4–20 mg) were homogenized with Precellys CKM beads (Hilden, Germany) in 350 µl of Qiagen RLT plus buffer. The genomic DNA (gDNA) and total RNA were isolated using the Qiagen AllPrep DNA/RNA/miRNA Universal Kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. After isolation, RNA and DNA were frozen and kept at −80 °C until further use. Isolated RNA samples were quantified using NanoDrop spectrophotometry (Thermo Scientific, Chino, CA). DNA and RNA were further quantified using the Qubit dsDNA High Sensitivity Kit and RNA Broad Range Kit, respectively (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). RNA quality was evaluated using the Agilent 2200 TapeStation and RNA ScreenTape (Santa Clara, CA). All RNA samples had an integrity numbers (RIN) ranging from 7.2 to 8.1. Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS) library construction One hundred (100) ng of gDNA was used to construct RRBS DNA-seq library using the Ovation®RRBS Methyl-Seq System (NuGEN Technologies, San Carlos, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, the MspI enzyme, which cuts the DNA at CCGG sites, was used to digest gDNA into fragments. The fragments were directly subject to end blunting and phosphorylation in preparation for ligation to a methylated adapter with a single-base T overhang. A unique index, out of 16 indices, was used for each individual sample for multiplexing. The ligation products were repaired in a thermal cycler under the program (60 °C–10 min, 70 °C–10 min, hold at 4 °C). The products of the final repair reaction were used for bisulfite conversion using QIAGEN EpiTect Fast DNA Bisulfite Kit according to Qiagen's protocol. Bisulfite-converted DNA was then amplified (Mastercycler®pro, Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany), and bead-purified with Agencourt RNAClean XP beads. The Ovation®Mouse RNA-Seq System 1–16 (NuGEN Technologies, San Carlos, CA) was used to construct RNA-seq libraries according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 100 ng of total RNA spiked with 1 µl of 1:500 diluted ERCC Mix 1 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) was used to start cDNA synthesis. Following the primer annealing and cDNA synthesis, the products (130 µl/each sample) were sheared using Covaris S220 Focused-ultrasonicator (Covaris Inc., Woburn, MA). The parameters were set as follows: 10% duty factor, peak power 175 and 200 cycles per burst at 4 °C for 200 seconds to obtain fragment sizes between 150–200 bp. The products were then subject to end-repair, adaptor index ligation and strand selection. A custom InDA-C primer mixture SS5 Version 5 for mouse was used to allow strand selection. Finally, the libraries were amplified on a PCR thermocycler for 17 cycles (Mastercycler®pro, Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany), and purified with RNAClean XP Agencourt beads (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN); and quantified using Qubit dsDNA HS Kit on Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). The quality and peak size were determined using the D1000 ScreenTape on Agilent 2200 TapeStation (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). RRBS and RNA-seq library sequencing The RRBS libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 550, 75 bp, single-end read, whereas the RNA-seq libraries were sequenced on both Illumina NextSeq 550 and HiSeq 4000, pair-end reads (75 bpx2), at the Loma Linda University (LLU) Center for Genomics. For the RRBS data, we used a pipeline that integrates the read quality assessment (FastQC, v0.11.6), trimming process (TrimGalore,40v0.4.5, NuGEN diversity trimming and N6 de-duplicate scripts), alignment (Bismark,41v0.16.34), and differential methylation analysis using MethylKit42(v0.1.0) and DMAP43(v2.8.1). This pipeline facilitates a rapid transition from sequencing reads to a fully annotated CpG methylation report for biological interpretation. Briefly, the RRBS raw fastq data were first trimmed using Trim Galore. The mouse genome NCBI GRCm38 downloaded from iGenome (https://support.illumina.com/sequencing/sequencing_software/igenome.html/Musmusculu/Mus_musculus_NCBI_GRCm38.tar.gz), was used as a reference genome. Reads were aligned to the mouse reference genome with Bismark (v0.16.34) by default parameter settings. The methylation call files including the location of each CpG site and the methylation percentage were generated by the bismark_methylation_extractor function. The aligned SAM files were further processed through DMAP to generate CpG region profile using function ‘diffmeth’ (options: -A 40, 220, -N -I 6). The CpG regions with coverage by a minimum 20 reads in all samples were used for further analysis. For the RNA-seq data, we adopted the pipelines used in our recent publications44,45for mRNA-seq data visualization, which integrated the QC (FastQC,46ShortRead,47v1.48.0), trimming process (trimmomatic,48v0.35), alignment (Tophat2,49v2.2.1), reads quantification (cufflinks,50v2.2.1), and differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis (cuffdiff,51v 2.2.1) for mRNA-seq data analyses. Briefly, the RNA-seq raw fastq data were first trimmed using Trimmomatic (options: Leading: 20, Trailing:20, Crop:75, Headcrop:5, Slidingwindow: 4:15, Minlen: 35). The trimmed reads were aligned to the mouse reference genome (NCBI GRCm38) using TopHat2 (default parameter settings). The aligned bam files were then processed using Cufflinks for gene quantification. The reads that were unable to align to the mouse genome were converted to fastq format using SamToFastq function in Picard (v1.11.4) for ERCC mapping and calculation in which the reads were mapped to ERCC transcripts and quantified using TopHat2 and Cufflinks (default parameter settings). The genes with FPKM ≥ 1 in all samples were used for DEG analysis. The DEGs were identified by Cuffdiff with FDR ≤ 0.3, and fold change (FC) ≥ 1.2 (P≤ 0.05). All bioinformatics pipelines were run with default parameters if not specified otherwise. We used a mouse epigenetic clock algorithm developed by Stubbset al. (2017)20to estimate the biological age of the retinas of spaceflight mice, using the MouseEpigeneticClock script on the methylation coverage files with default parameter of read depth threshold at 5. The mouse age estimator, based on the methylation of 329 CpG loci, was shown to accurately measure the epigenetic clock—biological age across multiple mouse tissues.19 Gene networks, pathway and functional annotation analyses PCA components were computed from normalized gene expression counts of 177 DEGs, or the beta values of all differentially methylated CpGs. Specifically, the missing values in input data were handled by the ‘imputePCA’ function from R package ‘missMDA’ (v1.18). Then, PCA was performed using ‘prcomp’ (scale = FALSE) function from R package ‘stats’ (v3.6.2). Finally, the contributions of each PCA component were extracted using ‘get_eigenvalue’ function. For DEG analysis, an FC ≥ 1.2 with P ≤ 0.05 (FDR ≤ 0.3) was used as a threshold to select DEGs. For DMG analysis, a methylation change ≥ 10% (FDR ≤ 0.05) was used as a threshold to select DMGs. Pathway analysis was performed using IPA and DAVID Functional Annotation Tool to identify canonical pathways. For other statistics analysis, data were presented as mean ± SD, and were analyzed using two-tailed Student'st-test or one-way ANOVA followed by Turkey's post hoc test.P-value ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Experimental number (N) represents the number of animals tested in each group. The authors would like to thank Dr. Thomas M.
