Long-duration spaceflight creates a variety of stresses due to the unique environment, which can lead to compromised functioning of the skeletal and immune systems. However, the mechanisms by which organisms respond to this stress remain unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the impact of three different gravitational loadings (microgravity, 1/6g[lunar gravity], and 1g) on the behavior, bone, thymus, and spleen of mice housed for 25–35 days in the International Space Station. The bone density reduction under microgravity was mostly recovered by 1gbut only partially recovered by 1/6g. Both 1gand 1/6gsuppressed microgravity-induced changes in some osteoblast and osteoclast marker gene expression. Thymus atrophy induced by microgravity was half recovered by both 1gand 1/6g, but gene expression changes were not fully recovered by 1/6g. While no histological changes were observed due to low gravity, alterations in gene expression were noted in the spleen. We found that in bone and thymus, lunar gravity reduced microgravity-induced histological alterations and partially reversed gene expression changes. This study highlighted organ-specific variations in responsiveness to gravity, serving as an animal test for establishing a molecular-level gravity threshold for maintaining a healthy state during future spaceflight. Subject terms:Transcriptomics, Immunology, Bone Space exploration has attracted attention in various fields, including materials, fuels, communication equipment, systems, medicine, and botany. To further explore space, the manned lunar exploration program “Artemis” has been initiated, and research is underway to address the various obstacles to the space environment1,2. Notably, astronauts experience various environmental challenges during spaceflight including microgravity, psychological stress, and high space radiation. These changes pose significant threats to the various physiological functions of astronauts. A prolonged stay in space induces changes, such as the deterioration of bones3,4, skeletal muscle function3, vestibular control5, optic nerve papillary edema6, and cardiac hypertrophy7among astronauts. These health issues are mainly managed through effective exercise in space; however, the mechanisms causing these changes are unknown. Several drawbacks must be considered for humans to explore space. In addition, it is difficult to verify effects on the human space environment. Research activities at the International Space Station (ISS) have been conducted on various microorganisms, plants, and animals8. To stably house mice, which are higher life forms, on the ISS, we developed breeding facilities in accordance with animal ethics guidelines, and housed mice on the ISS for approximately one month on five occasions, including the mission reported here, and all mice returned to Earth alive. To conduct space exploration, we must understand biological effects at the molecular level to adapt to space environments such as gravity on the Moon and Mars. It is important to study the effects of long-term gravitational fluctuations on living organisms, to prepare for future space exploration. In 2016, we successfully housed 12 mice in the ISS under either microgravity or artificial 1gfor 35 days using the Multiple Artificial-gravity Research System (MARS), which can exhibit varying gravitational forces using a centrifugal device (Mouse Habitat Unit (MHU)-1 mission)9,10. All the mice were alive after returning to Earth. The success of the MHU mission has been reported in the effects of microgravity on various organs, including skeletal muscles10,11, bone10, eye12, spleen13, thymus14, reproductive system15,16, and behavior17,18. For future manned exploration of the Moon and Mars, it is necessary to understand the effects of partial gravity of less than 1gon living organisms. Recently, the effects of lunar gravity on mice have been explored using MARS with two different short- and long-radius centrifuge lengths on the ISS (the MHU-4 and -5 missions in 2019 and 2020, respectively). Here, analysis of the soleus muscle of mice revealed that muscle atrophy and muscle fiber type might be regulated by different gravitational forces19. This study aimed to present the physiological effects of three different gravity environments on mice during three MHU missions (MHU-1, -4, and -5), based on histological characteristics and gene expression. We found that lunar gravity suppressed histological changes in the thymus, partially recovered bone mass loss, and partially recovered microgravity-induced changes in gene expression in bone, thymus, and spleen. Furthermore, the responsiveness to gravity varied in different organs; this research will serve as an animal test to elucidate the gravity threshold for each organ at the molecular level required to maintain a healthy state for future space travel. Overview of three mouse habitat unit (MHU) missions Overview of spaceflight experiments and behavioral tests. (A)Overview of the Mouse Habitat Unit (MHU) missions. Each experimental group is color-coded (MG (microgravity) for magenta, AG (artificial 1g) for dark blue, PG (partial gravity, 1/6g) for orange, and GC (1g) for green), and each color corresponds to a letter color and a plot point in the figure. 1GC: MHU-1_GC; 4GC: MHU-4_GC; 5GC: MHU-5_GC; MG: MHU-1_MG; AG: MHU-1_AG; 4PG: MHU-4_PG; 5PG: MHU-5_PG.

Data are represented as the mean and standard deviation (SD), and each dot represents an individual mouse (n = 5–6).P-value from the Student’st-test is indicated as ***P< 0.001. Lunar gravity loading partially recovered bone mass loss caused by microgravity To investigate the effect of gravity on bones, the right femur of the mice was analyzed using micro-computed tomography (Fig.2A,B). MG mice in the MHU-1 mission showed a significant decrease of 70% (1GC; 15.1 ± 2.2%, AG; 14.5 ± 1.2%, MG; 4.5 ± 2.7%) in the trabecular bone volume corrected by the tissue volume (BV/TV), whereas PG mice in the MHU-4 and -5 missions showed a significant decrease in BV/TV of only 30% (4GC; 20.6 ± 2.3%, 4PG; 14.4 ± 3.5%) and 28% (5GC; 27.4 ± 5.6%, 5PG; 19.6 ± 2.5%), respectively, although housing in MHU-4 and -5 was 10 days shorter than that in MHU-1. In cortical bone, cross-sectional area (Ct.Ar) and thickness (Ct.Th) decreased significantly by 17% (Ct.Ar: 1GC; 0.87 ± 0.02 mm2, MG; 0.72 ± 0.03 mm2) and 16% (Ct.Th: 1GC; 141.9 ± 2.1 µm, MG; 118.9 ± 7.7 µm) in MG mice in MHU-1. In PG mice, Ct.Ar and Ct.Th were reduced by 5% without significant difference in MHU-4 (Ct.Ar: 4GC; 0.91 ± 0.02 mm2, 4PG; 0.86 ± 0.07 mm2, and Ct.Th: 4GC; 150.4 ± 1.2 µm, 4PG; 142.7 ± 9.9 µm), while Ct.Ar and Ct.Th were significantly reduced by 7% and 5%, respectively, in MHU-5 (Ct.Ar: 5GC; 0.72 ± 0.03 mm2, 5PG; 0.67 ± 0.02 mm2, and Ct.Th: 5GC; 116.0 ± 3.8 µm, 5PG; 109.7 ± 2.7 µm). Although BV/TV decreased in the 1/6genvironment, the degree of decrease was smaller than that in the microgravity environment, suggesting that bone loss was partially prevented in the 1/6genvironment compared with that in microgravity. Moreover, plasma levels of the bone resorption marker, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) significantly increased while those of the bone formation marker, osteocalcin significantly decreased in the MG and two of the PG mice compared to those in GC mice (Fig.2C). However, compared to the increased proportion of TRAP (139%, 1GC; 3.9 ± 0.5 Unit/L, MG; 5.4 ± 0.5 Unit/L) and decreased proportion of osteocalcin (49%, 1GC; 60.8 ± 19.7 ng/mL, MG; 30.0 ± 2.7 ng/mL) in MG mice relative to that in 1GC mice, the proportions of TRAP (MHU-4: 127%, 4GC; 4.7 ± 0.3 Unit/L, 4PG; 6.0 ± 0.4 Unit/L and MHU-5: 139%, 5GC; 4.0 ± 0.9 Unit/L, 5PG; 5.6 ± 0.9 Unit/L) and osteocalcin (MHU-4: 44%, 4GC; 34.8 ± 5.9 ng/mL, 4PG; 15.4 ± 4.0 ng/mL and MHU-5: 51%, 5GC; 36.6 ± 4.7 ng/mL, 5PG; 18.8 ± 8.5 ng/mL) in PG mice were comparable, indicating that these changes in proportions were inconsistent with the differences in bone loss rates between microgravity and the 1/6genvironment. Moreover, the similarity in osteocalcin values between AG and MG mice in MHU-1 indicated that the regulation of osteocalcin expression may be independent of gravity.

Enhancement of osteoblast and osteoclast signals under microgravity The unloading environment during spaceflight causes loss of bone mass in mice23,24, which is induced by inhibited osteoblastic bone formation and enhanced osteoclastic bone resorption in a simulated microgravity environment25. However, since AG and lunar gravity had not been used in these studies, the effect of different loading gravities on gene expression in bone during spaceflight remains unclear. The thymus under lunar gravity is histologically normal, although microgravity does not prevent weight loss Following spaceflight, the thymus is known to undergo atrophy24–26, and findings of the MHU-1 mission also suggest that the weight of the thymus decreases in a microgravity environment, and artificial 1gpartially prevents this decrease14. In MHU-1, the mean thymus weight normalized by body weight in AG mice was reduced to 79.8% (1GC; 1.73 ± 0.22, AG; 1.38 ± 0.14) of that in 1GC mice, and that in MG mice was reduced to 56.6% (1GC; 1.73 ± 0.22, MG; 0.98 ± 0.17) of that in 1GC mice. In contrast, the mean thymus weight normalized by body weight in PG mice in MHU-4 and -5 decreased to 76.4% (4GC; 1.44 ± 0.17, 4PG; 1.10 ± 0.22) and 79.2% (5GC; 1.49 ± 0.14, 5PG; 1.18 ± 0.04) of that in GC mice, respectively. This indicates that 1/6gand artificial 1gpartially suppressed gravity-induced thymus reduction in mice (Fig.4A). Hematoxylin–eosin (HE) staining and immunohistochemical analysis were performed to determine the cause of thymus weight loss due to housing in a 1/6genvironment. HE staining revealed no significant changes between PG and GC mice (Fig.4B). This confirms that no abnormalities were also observed in the thymus of MG mice by HE staining carried out in our previous study14. In our previous study, immunostaining with anti-keratin-5 (Krt5; a marker for the medullary region) and keratin-8 (Krt-8; a marker for the cortical region) in the thymus of MHU-1 MG mice showed that Krt5-positive medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) are mislocalized in the cortical region14. In the present study, no significant changes were observed in the global structure and size of the medullary and cortical regions in PG mice (Fig.4C). Furthermore, immunostaining with anti-Aire (a transcription factor expressed in the medullary region),Ulex europaeusagglutinin 1 (UEA-1; a marker for mTECs), and nuclei showed no differences between PG and GC mice (Fig.4C). This result concurs with the lack of abnormality in the distribution of their expression, which we previously found to be unchanged among MG, AG, and GC mice in MHU-114. Thus, the abnormal distribution of thymic epithelial cells may depend on the degree of gravitational change. In summary, 1/6gand artificial 1gpartially countered thymic weight loss and prevented histological changes induced in the microgravity environment. Analysis of histological and gene expression changes in the thymus under microgravity and lunar gravity conditions.

(D) Clustering heatmap illustrating normalized (Z-score and one plus log 2) expression values for 2880 differentially expressed genes in the thymus between MHU-1_MG and MHU-1_GC. (E) Gene ontology analysis of genes in each cluster. Gene expression in the thymus under different gravitational loads Our previous study implied that artificial 1gcan alleviate thymic atrophy during spaceflight despite AG mice experiencing slightly lower gravity than that of GC mice owing to the relatively small radius of cage rotation14. In this study, we showed that 1/6gcould alleviate thymic weight loss, similar to AG. However, gene expression profiles in PG mice were different from those in AG mice, which suggests that 1/6gis still insufficient to attenuate all changes during spaceflight. Future studies using MARS are warranted to identify a gravity threshold that can prevent gene expression changes in space. In summary, the effects of both the space experimental procedure and low gravity on thymus atrophy may be involved, which is consistent with the clustering patterns of exhaustive gene expression. The effect of microgravity in the spleen was alleviated in lunar gravity Effect of lunar gravity on the spleen.

(G) Differentially expressed erythrocyte-related genes in (F). Data are represented as mean ± SD, and each dot represents an individual mouse (n = 3). FDR-correctedPvalues were calculated atP< 0.05 (CLC MW, Empirical analysis of DGE tool). ***P< 0.001. We further compared the expression of erythrocyte-related genes in the spleen. Erythrocyte-related genes, regulated byGata1andTal1, are downregulated due to the combined effect of space environments13. Moreover, experiments inNrf2(NF-E2-related factor-2) knockout mice suggest that these changes are not induced by flight-related stress but by other space-specific factors36. To elucidate the effect of different gravitational forces on erythroid genes, we compared the expression of 19 genes regulated byGata1andTal1(Fig.5F). All genes were downregulated in MG and both PG mice, but these reductions were partially alleviated in AG mice. Furthermore, we compared the expression levels ofAlas2, Slc4a1, Hba-a2,andRhag, which are known to regress after spaceflight regardless of Nrf2 expression36(Fig.5G). The expression levels ofAlas2, Slc4a1,andHba-a2were significantly lower in MG mice than those in GC mice. Moreover, these changes were not observed in either AG or PG mice. Consequently, gravity loading may partially rescue the downregulation of these erythropoiesis-related genes. This observation aligns with the hypothesis that weightlessness contributes to anemia during spaceflight37. Although we have uncovered novel facts that can only be elucidated through space experiments, our study has several limitations. First, because our space experiments only used mice, it is unclear whether our findings can be applied to human biology. Another limitation is that the tissue samples were collected on the second day after the mice returned to Earth. Therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility that our data, especially the RNA-seq data, were altered by the effects of exposure to the 1genvironment. Although space experiments must address various issues to be implemented, this study will serve as a resource for future research. In conclusion, using MARS, we evaluated the effects of microgravity and 1/6gin the bone, thymus, and spleen. In the bone and thymus, morphological and gene expression changes induced in microgravity were not completely alleviated in 1/6g. In contrast, the gravitational threshold for the spleen exited around 1/6g,considering the preserved splenic weight and structure. Thus, responsiveness to gravity, phenotypic abnormalities, and gene expression patterns varied in each organ. In addition, two different centrifuges were used to generate 1/6gin MHU-4 and -5, with different centrifuge radii, resulting in different speeds and gravity loads to the cephalic position. Although differences were observed between the MHU-4 and -5 missions in the righting reflex test, the marginal differences in RNA-seq findings for the thymus and spleen were negligible compared with those in other gravity conditions. This research will serve as an animal test to elucidate the gravity threshold for each organ at the molecular level required to maintain a healthy state for future space travel. Elucidating the underlying mechanisms and further evaluating the gravitational threshold for each organ may offer strategies to maintain skeletal structure and immune systems in future space exploration. C57BL/6J male mice (Stock #000664) were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) for the space experiments and Charles River Laboratories (Yokohama, Japan) for ground control experiments. All experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of JAXA (Protocol Number: 016-014B for MHU-1, No. 018-011D for MHU-4, and No. 018-036D for MHU-5); Explora Biolabs (Study Number: EB15-010A for MHU-1, No. EB19-003 for MHU-4, and No. SP19-003 for MHU-5); and NASA (Protocol Number: NAS-15-004-Y1 for MHU-1, No. FLT-18-118 for MHU-4, and No. JAXA MHU-5/ FLT-19-121 for MHU-5). The experiments were conducted according to the guidelines and applicable laws in Japan and the United States of America and complied with the ARRIVE guidelines. In all the MHU missions, 8–9-week-old C57BL/6J male mice in a TCU were launched aboard the SpaceX Dragon space vehicle from the NASA KSC in Florida and then transported to the ISS. In the ISS, mice were transferred to the HCU, one mouse per cage, and then housed in a centrifuge under the conditions described below for 35, 25, and 26 days for MHU-1, -4, and -5, respectively. MHU-1 mission: Twelve C57BL/6J male mice in the TCU were launched aboard SpX-9 on June 18, 2016, from the NASA KSC in Florida and then transported to the ISS. The mice were divided into two groups, AG and MG mice. The AG group was kept in an artificial 1genvironment (1gon the bottom floor of the HCU, at 77 rpm) in a MARS-S centrifuge. MHU-4 mission: Six C57BL/6J male mice in the TCU were launched aboard SpX-17 on May 7, 2019, from the NASA KSC and then transported to the ISS. The PG-S group was kept in an artificial 1/6genvironment (1/6gon the bottom floor of the HCU, at 31 rpm) in a MARS-S centrifuge. MHU-5 mission: Six C57BL/6J male mice in the TCU were launched aboard SpX-20 on March 10, 2020, from the NASA KSC and then transported to the ISS. The PG-L group was kept in an artificial 1/6genvironment (1/6gon the bottom floor of the HCU, at 21 rpm) in a MARS-L centrifuge. MARS-L is approximately 2.2 times larger in diameter than MARS-S, which decreases the gravity gradient, allowing for more precise gravity settings. Experiments on the GC group in each mission were conducted at the JAXA Laboratory in Japan a few months after the space experiments were completed. Six age-matched (8- or 9-weeks old) male C57BL/6J mice per mission were used, and the time spent in the TCU or HCU was the same for each space experiment. Phenotypic analyses for all three missions were conducted by the same researchers. Unavoidably, it took approximately 2, 1.2, and 2.3 days of transport time for MHU-1, -4, and -5, respectively, after return to Earth for initiating the experimental analysis at Explora Biolabs. The return phase and animal dissection Isoflurane-anesthetized mice were euthanized using exsanguination and dissected to collect tissue samples. Samples that required cryopreservation were transported by air in a refrigerated box containing dry ice. The journey from the laboratory where the dissections were performed in the USA to JAXA’s laboratory in Japan took several days in all instances (MHU-1, 4.0 days; MHU-4, 7.5 days; MHU-5, 5.5 days), and temperature changes during that time were checked using temperature data loggers. Micro-computed tomography analysis After fixation with 70% ethanol, distal regions of the femur were analyzed. Micro-computed tomography scanning was performed using a ScanXmate-A100S Scanner (Comscantechno, Yokohama, Japan). Reconstructed three-dimensional microstructural image data were analyzed and all parameters were calculated according to previously published guidelines38using TRI/3D-BON software (RATOC System Engineering, Co., Ltd, Tokyo, Japan). Briefly, parameters of trabecular tissue volume (TV, mm3), trabecular bone volume (BV, mm3), trabecular bone thickness (Tb.Th, µm), trabecular bone number (Tb.N, /mm), trabecular bone separation (Tb.Sp, µm; intervals among trabecular bones), average thickness of cortical bone (Ct.Th, µm), and cross-sectional area of cortical bone (Ct.Ar, mm2) were measured directly based on the computed tomography images. A percentage of the trabecular bone volume for the total tissue volume was calculated as BV/TV (%). Bone mineral content in the trabecular bone tissue (BMC/TV, mg/cm3) and bone mineral density in the cortical bone (BMD, mg/cm3) were measured with a bone mineral quantification phantom. Measurement of plasma TRAP and osteocalcin Plasma levels of TRAP and osteocalcin were measured with MouseTRAP™ (TRAcP 5b) ELISA (Immunodiagnostic Systems, UK), and Mouse Gla-Osteocalcin High Sensitive EIA Kit (Takara Bio Inc, Shiga, Japan) according to instructions provided by the manufacturer. Bone tissues were prepared as previously described with modifications20. Connective tissues and the periosteum of femurs and tibiae were removed, and the bones were cut at the metaphyses. After bone marrow cells were removed from the diaphyses of femurs and tibiae by flushing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the bones were incubated with 1 mg/mL collagenase and 2 mg/mL dispase in alpha-minimum essential medium at 37 °C for 20 min, and then treated using a micro-interdental brush. The remaining bone was used as an osteocyte-enriched bone. The bones were collected in TRIZOL reagent and ground into a powder using a tissue pulverizer (Minilys, Bertin Technologies, France) for total RNA extraction. Total RNA was extracted from bone, spleen, and thymus using TRIZOL reagent according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). The RNA-seq library was prepared from 50 ng RNA using the NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) after rRNA depletion (NEB NEBNext rRNA Depletion Kit). Paired-end sequencing (2 × 36 bases) was performed using NextSeq500 (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Sequence reads were mapped to the mouse genome (mm10) using CLC Genomics Workbench (Version 10.1.1; Qiagen, Redwood City, CA). Gene expression levels were calculated as the total read count normalized to transcripts per million. Genes with 0 counts in all samples and genes with total lead counts of 5 or less were excluded. Differential expression was analyzed using the Empirical Analysis of DGE tool (edgeR)39in the CLC Main Workbench (CLC MW, Version 21.0.3; Qiagen). Differentially expressed genes were extracted among the conditions (MHU-1_GC vs. MHU-1_MG, MHU-4_4GC vs. MHU-4_4PG, and MHU-5_5GC vs. MHU-5_5PG) with FDR-correctedP< 0.05. The clustering heatmap was generated in Morpheus (https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus/). GO analysis of each cluster was performed using the Enrichr webtool (https://maayanlab.cloud/Enrichr/). Histological and immunostaining of tissue sections For histological analysis, the spleen and thymus were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 16 h at 4 °C and embedded in paraffin. Paraffin sections of 5-μm thickness were mounted on glass slides and subjected to HE staining. For immunohistochemical analysis, the spleen and thymus were snap-frozen in optimal cutting temperature compound (Sakura Finetek, Japan). Frozen sections of 6-μm thickness were mounted on glass slides coated with amino silane. After fixing with ice-cold acetone for 5 min, sections were blocked with 10% goat serum in PBS and then treated with the following primary antibodies: anti-CD3e (BioLegend; 100236, 1:200), anti-CD45R (B220, BioLegend; 103228, 1:400), anti-TER119 (BioLegend; 116203, 1:300), anti-Keratin 5 (Krt5; Biolegend 905503, 1:500), and Alexa Flour 488-labeled anti-Keratin 8 (Krt8; Abcam ab192467, 1:50) antibodies, Alexa Flour 488-labeled anti-mouse Aire antibody (eBioscience; 53-5934-82, 1:500), and Biotin-labeled UEA-1 (Vector laboratories; B-1065-2, 1:50) in PBS containing 10% goat serum for 1 h at 24 °C, after washing, and further incubation with Alexa Fluor 546-labeled Goat anti-Rabbit IgG (Invitrogen; A-11035, 1:500) Alexa Flour 546-labeled Streptavidin (Invitrogen;S11225, 1:500) for 1 h at 24 °C, the sections were covered with glass coverslips using a mounting solution. Images were captured using a confocal laser scanning microscope. At least three different sections were analyzed for each sample (Leica, SP8). All data are presented as the mean of biological replicates and dots of the individual sample data. Comparisons between groups (excluding RNA-seq analysis, as explained previously) were performed using appropriate statistical tests for each data set. Tests for normal distribution were carried out using the Shapiro–Wilk test. Normally distributed data were tested using Student’st-test for paired samples (MHU-4 and -5), and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Tukey’s test for multiple independent groups (MHU-1). Non-normally distributed data were tested using the Mann–WhitneyUtest for paired samples (MHU-4 and -5), and the Kruskal–Wallis test, followed by Dunn’s test for multiple independent groups (MHU-1). Statistical significance was set atP< 0.05.
