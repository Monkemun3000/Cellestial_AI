Key Words:Spaceflight, Unfolded protein response,Arabidopsis, Microgravity. Extraterrestrial habitation and prolonged space travel require successful plant growth to recreate livable environments for humans (Ferlet al.,2002; Massaet al.,2016; Zhouet al.,2019). Studies over the past 70 years have sought to develop a better understanding of how plants are affected by and adapt to the significant stresses imposed by spaceflight (e.g., microgravity, radiation, vibration, limited exchange of gases), which can affect plant development and yield (Paulet al.,2013). Recent iterations of the sophisticated chamber hardware for plant growth housed on the International Space Station (ISS) have allowed for multigenerational plant growth in space and analyses of plant responses to this environment (Massaet al.,2016). However, these facilities are insufficient for large-scale plant growth on extraterrestrial environments due to their size and resource cost. Therefore, generation of germplasm adapted to stresses experienced during growth in extraterrestrial environments is a critical contribution to the realization of sustainable plant cultivation in space. The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a signaling cascade that responds to a number of unfavorable environmental and cellular stresses. The UPR is generally activated by a buildup of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a condition known as ER stress (Ron and Walter,2007). The ER stress sensors conserved across metazoans and plants include the ER-associated protein kinase and ribonuclease inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) and ER membrane-tethered transcription factors (TFs) (metazoan activating transcription factor 6 [ATF6] and plant basic leucine zipper 17 [bZIP17] and bZIP28). Activation of IRE1 leads to unconventional splicing of an intron from the mRNA of an IRE1-downstream bZIP-TF (metazoan X-box binding protein 1 and plant bZIP60). The UPR TFs are translocated to the nucleus to control expression of UPR target genes and restore ER homeostasis (Koizumiet al.,2001; Chen and Brandizzi,2012; Halbleibet al.,2017; Kimet al.,2018; Rubertiet al.,2018; Tamet al.,2018; Mishibaet al.,2019; Pastor-Cantizanoet al.,2019; Puet al.,2019). Insufficient UPR leads to the actuation of cell death (Ron and Walter,2007; Walter and Ron,2011). In terrestrially grown plants, the UPR is a key mediator of responses to a variety of stresses, including heat, pathogen, and high light/singlet oxygen (Denget al.,2011; Morenoet al.,2012; Guillemetteet al.,2014; Zhanget al.,2015, 2017; Pastor-Cantizanoet al.,2019; Beaugelinet al.,2020). Additionally, analyses of higher order UPR mutants have demonstrated that the UPR regulators are necessary for post-embryonic growth and reproductive development inArabidopsisunder unstressed conditions as well (Chen and Brandizzi,2012; Kimet al.,2018; Mishibaet al.,2019; Puet al.,2019). Therefore, a better understanding of the UPR can enable efforts to potentiate plant stress responses and improve plant yield. 2.1. Launch hardware and experimental timeline This flight experiment utilized 4 Biological Research In a Canister (BRIC) containing a total of 22 Petri Dish Fixation Unit (PDFU) hardware (Wellset al.,2001) to cultivate sterile dark-grown seedlings germinated aboard the ISS for a 14 day period. PDFU actuation chambers were loaded with a tissue fixative (RNAlater; Invitrogen) to preserve samples at the conclusion of the flight experiment. An identical set of samples was prepared and grown on Earth with a 2-day offset at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) ISS Environmental Simulator to allow for data transmission and reproduction of incubation conditions experienced by flight samples in orbit. HOBO data loggers equipped with temperature sensors were integrated into two of the four BRICs to record temperatures experienced by samples during the experiment forpost hocanalysis. Launch samples (i.e.,Arabidopsisseeds) were integrated into BRIC flight hardware in a sterile hood ∼48 h before the August 14, 2017, launch of SpaceX CRS12 spacecraft. Integrated science/hardware was kept at 4°C to maintain seed dormancy before packing in cold storage bags while being loaded onto Dragon capsule and during launch. After docking, samples were removed from cold storage bags by ISS astronauts, warmed to ambient ISS temperature, allowing seed germination and experiment initiation in the BRIC. After 14 days, ISS astronauts actuated PDFUs, which were then incubated at room temperature for a further 3 h before being transferred to the ISS −80 MELFI freezer. Samples were kept at approximately −80°C until BRICs were conditioned to −32°C in double cold bag storage (Hutchison and Campana, 2009) and stowed in the Dragon capsule before undocking and atmospheric reentry on September 16. After returning to KSC, samples were stored at −80°C until de-integration of the flight and ground samples. De-integration occurred on November 1, 2017. 2.2. Germplasm and culture conditions Arabidopsis thalianaseeds of the following genotypes were used for flight and ground controls: WT (Col-0 ecotype),atire1(Nagashimaet al.,2011; Chen and Brandizzi,2012),bzip60(Morenoet al.,2012),bzip28(Gaoet al.,2008), andbzip28 bzip60(Denget al.,2013). Petri dishes (60 mm) were prepared with 6.7 mL of sterile ½ Murashige and Skoog media supplemented with Gamborg's B5 Vitamins (PhytoTechnology Laboratories), 0.5% sucrose (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.4% Phytagel (Sigma-Aldrich), pH adjusted to 5.7. In a sterile hood, seeds of WT and UPR-mutant genotypes were surface sterilized with one wash of 70% ethanol, one wash of 50% bleach containing 0.5% Tween 20, and then nine additional washes with sterile H2O distilled twice. After the final wash was removed, seeds were resuspended in 1.5 mL sterile water for wet plating by using a 1 mL pipette equipped with sterile filter tip. For each experimental unit (flight and ground control), five plate replicates of WT andbzip28/bzip60genotypes and four plate replicates ofatire1,bzip28, andbzip60genotypes were prepared. Each plate replicate contained 70–80 seeds evenly spaced in a grid pattern on the plate surface. The Petri dishes were sealed with Parafilm (Heathrow Scientific), and individual plates were then wrapped twice with sterile aluminum foil. Individually wrapped plates were grouped by BRIC configuration and wrapped together with two more layers of sterile aluminum foil before sample removal from the sterile hood. Plates were placed at 4°C until the integration of samples into science hardware the following morning. 2.3. Sample processing and experimental material assessment 2.4. Library preparation, sequencing, and bioinformatics analysis RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) libraries were constructed by using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library (Illumina, San Diego, CA) and sequenced in single-end mode on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform (50-nt) at Research Technology Support Facility Genomics Core at Michigan State University. For each library, read quality was assessed with the FastQC (version 0.11.3) software (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc). Reads were cleaned for quality and adapter sequences with Cutadapt (version1.8.1) using a minimum base quality 20 retaining reads with a minimum length of 30 nucleotides after trimming (Martin,2011). Quality-filtered reads were aligned to the Col-0 reference genome (TAIR10) with Bowtie (version 2.3.1) and TopHat (version 2.1.1) with a 10 bp minimum intron length and 15,000 bp maximum intron length (Langmead and Salzberg,2012; Kimet al.,2013). Fragments per kilobase exon model per million mapped reads (FPKM) were measured by using TAIR10 gene model annotation with Cufflinks (version 1.3.0) (Trapnellet al.,2010). The log2 transformed and normalized gene expression levels (FPKM +1) were used for correlation analysis (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient) between biological replicates and principal component analysis (PCA). Per-gene read counts were identified with HTSeq (version 0.6.1p1) in the union mode with a minimum mapping quality of 20 with stranded reverse counting (Anderset al.,2015). Differential gene expression analysis was performed in four biological replicates (for WT andbzip28 bzip60, selected based on the correlation with other biological replicates) with DESeq2 (version 1.16.1) within R (version 3.4.0) based on a comparison of spaceflight to ground with adjustedp-value <0.01 and absolute log2-transformed fold change >1.5 (Loveet al.,2014). Genes of which the total count across all samples is <100 were not included in the analysis. Gene Ontology (GO) overrepresentation was performed with PANTHER (Fisher's exact type with false discovery rate correction) (www.pantherdb.org) (Miet al.,2019a,2019b). K-means clustering analysis on average FPKM values from biological replicates was performed using the Morpheus tool (Morpheus,https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus). The optimal number of K-means clusters was determined with the factoextra package in R. 3.1. Spaceflight alters the growth of seedlings independent of an intact UPR signaling When we inspected the WT and UPR-mutant seedlings (atire1,bzip60,bzip28, andbzip28 bzip60) of the ground control and flight samples at the completion of the mission, we found that in the ground control samples, etiolated hypocotyls (i.e., pale and elongated due to the lack of light) were above the surface of the solidified media while roots had penetrated the growth medium perpendicular to the surface (Fig. 1A). However, in flight samples, we found that etiolated hypocotyls as well as roots had generally penetrated the growth medium regardless of genotype tested (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, we also observed that cotyledon petioles of flight sample seedlings were elongated (Fig. 1B) compared with ground control seedlings (Fig. 1A). Overall, these observations are consistent with plant growth in the darkness and space, conditions leading to elongated hypocotyls and petioles, and a lack of directional growth, respectively (Paulet al.,2017). These observations also suggest that the UPR unlikely exerts a noticeable role in growth direction in response to altered gravity levels. (A)Representative ground and flight sample plates were imaged after the bulk of etiolated hypocotyls, and RNAlater was removed to ensure maximal RNA integrity. Remaining seedlings were used forpost hocanalysis of morphological/growth differences.(B)Left: Example plate of a WT flight sample, which was imaged after thawing, but before seedling removal. Individual seedlings that could be distinguished from the bulk were marked with a blue arrow to mark the shoot meristem. The cotyledons of elongated petioles were marked with a red arrow and a red line used to connect the cotyledon to the meristem of the same seedling. Petioles were elongated compared with ground sample petioles [representative morphology of ground control presented in(A)]. WT, wild type.

Global transcriptomic analyses indicate that gene expression reprogramming in response to spaceflight depends partially on intact UPR signaling (A)Spearman's correlation coefficients demonstrate a close relationship between biological replicates.(B)Principal component analysis demonstrates a clear separation between flight and ground samples. In summary, based on the verified number of upregulated and downregulated DEGs in flight samples compared with ground samples across genotypes, the UPR mutants had consistently fewer overall DEGs than WT, indicating that the UPR could play at least a partial a role in regulating the transcriptional reprogramming in space compared with ground control. 3.4. Biological pathways connected to the DEGs between flight and ground 3.5. The UPR regulators exert a minor but significant role on gene expression in spaceflight Overall, by comparing thebzip60andbzip28single mutants with thebzip28 bzip60double mutant, our transcriptomic profiling provides evidence for a highly complex, unconventional, regulatory relationship between bZIP60 and bZIP28 under the conditions experienced by ground control seedlings. Furthermore, a small number of significant differences between WT and the UPR mutants in spaceflight were found, supporting a small but significant role of the UPR in gene expression in spaceflight. In this study, we examined the transcriptional responses of WT and seedlings with a compromised UPR to spaceflight to set the foundations to manipulate a critical growth and stress signaling pathway for improving plant adaptation to extraterrestrial environments. We utilized the BRIC-PDFU sterile plant culture hardware during the SpaceX CRS12 mission to compare the transcriptional responses with the spaceflight betweenA. thalianaWT and mutants defective in one or more components of the UPR, namely the TFs bZIP60, bZIP28, and the ER-resident kinase/ribonuclease IRE1. One likely explanation is related to the hypocotyl-tissue media contact that occurred in our flight samples, which lacked a clear growth vector in microgravity, but had not occurred in our ground samples where roots grew perpendicular into the media. In previous experiments by Johnsonet al.(2015) and Paulet al.(2017), the dark-grown ground control plates were oriented vertically and both sample sets displayed petiole elongation, although the precise differences in length or extent of petiole elongation between flight and ground were not quantified. How media contact could induce R/FR light signaling in the dark is not immediately obvious; however, earlier studies showed that media containing sucrose modulated the R/FR signaling mediated by phytochromeA, promoting a red light response (Dijkwelet al.,1997). Coincidentally, the higher rRNA and RNA content observed in flight samples compared with ground control samples in our study (Fig. 2) is also consistent with an increased exposure of cells to sucrose or glucose, which is known to induce RNA accumulation, rRNA transcription, and ribosome biogenesis in plants (Kojimaet al.,2007; Ishidaet al.,2016), yeast (Kunkelet al.,2019), and mammals (Hannanet al.,2003). Nonetheless, we cannot rule out the remote possibility that our observations may be influenced by possible interactions between ionizing radiation and phytochrome R/FR signaling. For example, low-dose gamma (γ) irradiation of lettuce seeds was found to mimic the effects of FR deactivation of red light-activated phytochromes (Hsiao and Vidaver,1974). Additionally, a structural study of the bacterial phytochrome from the radiation-resistant bacteriaDeinococcus radioduransestablished that X-ray radiation induced deprotonation of chromophore in the inactive phytochrome, a biochemical step thought to be involved in light-induced activation of this protein (Liet al.,2015). Although the dose required to deprotonate 50% of the phytochrome (Liet al.,2015) was orders of magnitude larger than that expected to be experienced during our experimental period on the ISS, differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic phytochromes could affect relevant properties of a hypothetical phytochrome–radiation interaction.
