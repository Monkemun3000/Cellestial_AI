Revised 2021 Jun 23; Received 2021 Mar 17; Accepted 2021 Jul 6; Issue date 2021 Sep. Cadaverine is a polyamine produced by plants and microbes, which has been shown to accumulate in plants under stress conditions and to inhibit primary root growth. Here, we show that cadaverine affects Arabidopsis root growth primarily by inhibiting the biotin biosynthesis pathway, thereby affecting primary metabolism and the lipid profile. Cadaverine (1,5‐diaminopentane) is a polyamine associated with environmental perception and modulation of biological processes in prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. In plants, alterations in cadaverine levels induce changes in root architecture (Gamarnik and Frydman,1991; Liu et al.,2014; Niemi et al.,2002; Strohm et al.,2015), fresh weight (Cassán,2009; Tomar et al.,2013), and stress response (Aziz et al.,1998; Cassán,2009; Kuznetsov et al.,2007; Liu et al.,2000; Shevyakova et al.,2001; Sziderics et al.,2010) with implications in crop yield and environmental stress resistance (reviewed in Jancewicz et al.,2016). Cadaverine is produced by decarboxylation of lysine in plastids (Bunsupa et al.,2012), a process that has been shown to be upregulated by environmental stresses, including heat, drought, and salt stress, in ice plant (Kuznetsov et al.,2007; Shevyakova et al.,2001), pepper (Sziderics et al.,2010), and maize (Simon‐Sarkadi et al.,2014). On the other hand, free cadaverine levels are below the limit of detection inArabidopsis thaliana(Bunsupa et al.,2012; Shimizu et al.,2019). However, all plants can accumulate cadaverine directly from their environment, in the form of molecules secreted by microbes from the phyllosphere, rhizosphere or endosphere, or diffusing from decomposing matter (Cassán,2009). Importantly, both endogenous cadaverine and exogenously applied cadaverine can modulate plant growth and environment‐related stress resistance (reviewed in Jancewicz et al.,2016).A. thalianaseedlings exposed to exogenous cadaverine display altered root‐growth behavior, clearly indicating a role for this compound in root‐growth regulation (Strohm et al.,2015). Similar to other polyamines, cadaverine catabolism produces hydrogen peroxide and other derived compounds, which serve as transducers in a variety of physiological, developmental, and environmental stress responses in animals, plants, and microbes. InLeguminosae, cadaverine is a precursor for quinolizidine alkaloids, which act to deter insects (Bunsupa et al.,2012). Much of the polyamine content within plant cells has been shown to be in the conjugated form (Torrigiani et al.,1987). Cadaverine can conjugate to lignin precursors, although other acceptors of conjugation are possible (Negrel et al.,1992). Despite these important roles of cadaverine in a broad aspect of plant development and physiology, very little is known about the molecular mechanisms that modulate plant responses to cadaverine. To date, three cadaverine‐response genes have been identified inA. thaliana:OCT1,PAO4, andSPMS(Liu et al.,2014; Strohm et al.,2015).OCT1encodes an organic cation transporter previously implicated in carnitine transport (Lelandais‐Brière et al.,2007; Strohm et al.,2015).PAO4,on the other hand, encodes a polyamine oxidase that functions in the back‐conversion of spermine into spermidine, and spermidine into putrescine (Liu et al.,2014).SPMSencodes a spermine synthase. To understand this process better, we carried out a forward genetic screen inA. thaliana, seeking mutations that affect root‐growth responses to exogenous cadaverine. This screen revealed biotin as a possible target for the cadaverine‐induced pathway. In addition, the named vitamin B7 or H, biotin is an essential cofactor that functions in carboxylation reactions associated withde novofatty acid biosynthesis and amino acid homeostasis (Alban et al.,2000). In both plants and fungi, biotin synthesis starts with the conversion of pimeloyl‐coenzyme A (pimeloyl‐CoA) to 7‐keto‐8‐aminoperlargonic acid (KAPA), which is catalyzed by the cytosol‐ and peroxisome‐localized KAPA synthase enzyme (encoded by theBIO4gene in Arabidopsis) (Pinon,2005; Tanabe et al.,2011). Subsequent reactions occur in the mitochondria, and produce 7,8‐diaminopelargonic acid (DAPA), dethiobiotin (DTB), and finally biotin. These reactions are catalyzed by the DAPA synthase (BIO1), DTB synthase (BIO3), and biotin synthase (BIO2) enzymes, respectively (Cobessi et al.,2012; Muralla et al.,2007; Picciocchi et al.,2001; Shellhammer and Meinke,1990). In plants and fungi, BIO1 and BIO3 form a bifunctional, homodimeric enzyme that is encoded by a single gene (ArabidopsisBIO3‐BIO1,At5G57590) (Muralla et al.,2007). In Arabidopsis, five carboxylases have been shown to use biotin as a cofactor: acetyl‐CoA carboxylase (ACCase; which catalyzes the first step inde novofatty acid biosynthesis) (Sasaki et al.,1993; Yanai et al.,1995), 3‐methylcrotonyl‐CoA carboxylase (MCCase; which contributes to leucine catabolism) (Alban et al.,1993; Song et al.,1994), propionyl‐CoA carboxylase (an enzyme that functions at the intersection between fatty acid, amino acid, and sugar metabolism pathways) (Wurtele and Nikolau,1990), geranoyl‐CoA carboxylase (Guan et al.,1999), and pyruvate carboxylase (a key contributor to gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis) (Wurtele and Nikolau,1990; reviewed in Nikolau et al.,2003). A role for biotin beyond its function as a cofactor in carboxylases has also been suggested (Che,2003), as has its potential contribution to the regulation of expression of defense‐related genes (Li et al.,2012). Furthermore, an uncharacterized nuclear‐localized biotinylated protein has also been identified as potential regulator of target gene expression (Li et al.,2012). In this work, we show that cadaverine modulates primary root growth, mainly, by altering the biotin metabolic pathway inA. thaliana. Cadaverine‐induced inhibition of root growth can be rescued with supplementation of biotin and biotin‐pathway intermediates downstream of BIO1. Furthermore, we observed that decreased biotinylation of ACCase subunit BCCP1, as a result of cadaverine treatment, leads to a reduction of fatty acid synthesis. This study will contribute toward understanding how biotin limitation affects plant growth, and the role of cadaverine as a natural biotin inhibitor. cdh3mutation enhances primary root growth sensitivity to cadaverine in Arabidopsis cdh3is hypersensitive to cadaverine (Cad).

(c) Seedlings were germinated on 200 μmcadaverine or control media and treated with propidium iodide to stain the cell walls. Stained roots were then analyzed using confocal microscopy.

Bars indicate standard error. *P< 0.05, **P< 0.01, ***P< 0.001 analyzed by a mixed‐effects model with anF‐test for the interaction between time and treatment with Tukey’s adjustment for multiple comparisons. (g)cdh3and wild‐type root growths were measured from day 6 to 10 on control or media supplemented with the indicated concentrations of putrescine, spermidine, and spermine. Root growths were standardized to growth on control media for each genotype. Whiskers show minimum to maximum values. ANOVA with Tukey's HSD correction was used to determine significance. Cadaverine decreases primary root growth earlier in thecdh3mutant than the wild type In previous work involving wild‐type Lerseedlings, Strohmet al. showed that exogenous cadaverine inhibits primary root growth mostly by affecting cell elongation (Strohm et al.,2015). They also demonstrated the existence of substantial natural variation between Arabidopsis accessions in their primary root growth responses to exogenous cadaverine (Strohm et al.,2015). Therefore, we tested the effects of exogenous cadaverine on wild‐type Col‐0, analyzing cell elongation and apical root meristem size. Eight‐day‐old seedlings were grown on 200 µmcadaverine or control media, and roots were treated with propidium iodide, a cell‐wall stain (Strohm et al.,2015), to determine cell sizes and zone boundaries in the root tip. The decrease in primary root growth was found to be mostly associated with alterations in cell size within the elongation zone (FigureS2), whereas the number of cells in the root apical meristem was not substantially affected in the wild type (Figure1c–e). However,cdh3showed a significantly smaller root meristem upon cadaverine treatment, whilecdh3grown on control media showed an equal number of cells compared with wild type. In addition to decreased cell division and cell expansion incdh3, propidium iodide permeated a number of cells within the elongation zone, suggesting cell death (Figure1c). We next wanted to determine the time at which cell elongation is modified following cadaverine treatment by measuring changes in tip growth over time. Five‐day‐old seedlings were transferred on to split agar plates containing control or 200 µmcadaverine media and imaged for 4 days using a high‐resolution camera. Wild‐type roots began to show a significant decrease in tip growth after 96 h of cadaverine treatment.cdh3, on the other hand, showed a decrease in root tip growth already 40 h after onset of cadaverine treatment (Figure1f). Therefore, thecdh3mutation substantially increases the speed of root‐tip response to exogenous cadaverine. Taken together, our data indicate thatcdh3alters a mechanism involved in the control of primary root growth in response to cadaverine, a process that targets the regulation of anisotropic cell expansion occurring in the main elongation zone as well as the meristem. cdh3’s enhanced cadaverine response is the result of a mutation inBIO3‐BIO1 cdh3contains a mutation inBIO3‐BIO1. (a) Next‐generation sequencing revealed a peak on chromosome 5 with a high proportion of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) compared with the reference sequence.

(d,e) Significant differences between groups detected using ANOVA with Tukey’s HSD correction (P< 0.05), are indicated with distinct letters. Cadaverine response is chemically suppressed by biotin Initial studies with the embryo‐lethalbio1‐1mutant showed that knockout of biotin synthesis in plants can be rescued by application of exogenous biotin (Schneider et al.,1989). To determine ifcdh3’s hypersensitive root‐growth response to cadaverine is the result of decreased biotin, we supplemented 200 μmcadaverine‐containing media with biotin at concentrations ranging from 10 to 100 nm(Schneider et al.,1989). The cadaverine‐hypersensitive phenotype displayed bycdh3roots was rescued in a dose‐dependent manner to near wild‐type root growth by addition of biotin (Figure3a). In addition, the inhibitory effect of cadaverine on wild‐type root growth was also suppressed by addition of 80 nmbiotin to the medium (Figure3a). These data are compatible with cadaverine targeting the biotin pathway or modulating biotin availability or function. Alternatively, cadaverine and biotin could function through parallel pathways to modify primary root growth. Biotin suppresses wild‐type primary root growth response to cadaverine (Cad) and rescues the hypersensitive root growth response ofcdh3.

Different letters indicate statistically different groups (P< 0.05). Whiskers show minimum to maximum values. As root‐growth response to cadaverine can be alleviated by biotin supplementation in bothcdh3and wild‐type seedlings, we tested if we could identify cadaverine‐hypersensitive lines that cannot be rescued by biotin, thereby identifying downstream regulators in the cadaverine‐response pathway.ORGANIC CATION TRANSPORTER 1mutant,oct1‐1, andPOLYAMINE OXIDASE 4mutant,pao4‐1, have been shown to be hypersensitive to cadaverine (Liu et al.,2014; Strohm et al.,2015).oct1andpao4mutants were tested for chemical rescue on biotin‐ and cadaverine‐containing media. As shown in Figure3c,doct1andpao4mutant roots no longer displayed cadaverine hypersensitivity in the presence of biotin. Hence, biotin appears to function downstream of, or parallel to,OCT1andPAO4in the cadaverine‐response pathway. Cadaverine directly modulates biotin synthesis by altering BIO3‐BIO1 enzymatic activity Cadaverine (Cad) inhibits BIO3‐BIO1 enzymatic activity. (b)BIO3‐BIO1expression is unaltered by cadaverine treatment.BIO3‐BIO1expression was quantified using quantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction on cDNA prepared from RNA extracted from 8‐day‐old seedlings germinated on 200 μmcadaverine or control media, or transferred to cadaverine for 24, 48, or 72 h. Expression is standardized toPP2Areference gene. No statistically significant differences were observed using ANOVA. Bars represent standard error with values of individual biological replicates shown as symbols according to genotype and treatment indicated in the key. BIO3‐BIO1transcript and protein are unaffected by cadaverine treatment To determine if cadaverine also affects the regulation ofBIO3‐BIO1expression, we next quantified the levels ofBIO3‐BIO1transcripts in control and cadaverine‐treated wild‐type andcdh3seedlings. RNA was extracted from whole seedlings germinated on cadaverine‐containing media, or treated with cadaverine for 24, 48, or 72 h, along with controls grown on cadaverine‐free medium. No significant differences were identified between cadaverine‐treated and control samples, or betweencdh3and wild‐type seedlings (Figure4b). In addition, cadaverine did not influence the expression of other biotin synthesis genes,BIO4(At5G04620) andBIO2(At2G43360) (FigureS3). This result contrasts with an earlier report that showed increasedBIO2expression upon biotin depletion (Patton et al.,1996). Together, these data suggest that cadaverine‐induced inhibition of biotin synthesis under our conditions is not sufficiently severe to result in increasedBIO2expression. To investigate a potential effect of cadaverine on BIO3‐BIO1 protein abundance, wild‐type,cdh3, andcdh3[BIO3‐BIO1pro::BIO3‐BIO1] rescue line #2 were germinated and grown on either control or cadaverine‐containing media for 8 days. Proteins were extracted from dissected root and shoot tissues, separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and subjected to Western blot analysis, probing with a BIO3‐BIO1‐specific antibody (Cobessi et al.,2012). Thecdh3[BIO3‐BIO1pro::BIO3‐BIO1] rescue line expressed increased amounts of BIO3‐BIO1 protein relative to wild type, irrespective of cadaverine treatment (Figure4c), consistent with its increasedBIO3‐BIO1transcripts (Figure2e). Minimal differences in relative BIO3‐BIO1 protein abundance were observed between cadaverine‐treated and control samples for all genotypes and tissues tested (Figure4c), suggesting that cadaverine has limited impacts on overall expression of the BIO3‐BIO1 protein in Arabidopsis. Cadaverine treatment decreases the biotinylation of biotin carboxyl carrier proteinsin planta Considering that cadaverine inhibits biotin synthesis, we hypothesized that treating Arabidopsis seedlings with cadaverine should result in decreased biotinylation of target proteins in plant tissues. Previous studies have shown that probing Western blot membranes with a streptavidin probe allows the detection of a minimum of three biotinylated plant proteins, including MCCA, involved in amino acid metabolism, and the biotin carboxyl carrier protein 1 and 2 subunits (BCCP1 and BCCP2) of chloroplastic, heterodimeric ACCase, involved in fatty acid metabolism (Aubert et al.,1996; Che,2003; Li et al.,2012). BCCP2 is primarily expressed in flowers and developing seeds, but scarcely detectable in seedling tissues (Thelen et al.,2001). We used a similar Western blot analysis to determine whether cadaverine treatment is sufficient to induce differences in MCAA and/or BCCP proteins biotinylation in dissected root and/or shoot tissues. Wild‐type,cdh3, andcdh3[BIO3‐BIO1pro::BIO3‐BIO1] #2rescue seedlings were germinated and grown on control or cadaverine‐containing media for 8 days. Roots and shoots were then dissected. Proteins extracted from these samples were subjected to Western blot analysis using a streptavidin probe. The amounts of biotinylated MCCA protein showed little change upon cadaverine treatment in the root (Figure5a,c) or shoot (Figure5b,d). On the other hand, a decrease in biotinylated BCCP1 protein was observed in both roots (Figure5a,e) and shoots (Figure5b,f), with a larger magnitude of decrease occurring in the roots. Levels of biotinylated proteins are altered following cadaverine (Cad) treatment. qRT‐PCR analysis ofMCCAandBCCP1expression showed no significant transcriptional alteration incdh3and Col‐0 upon cadaverine treatment, whether applied since germination, or for 24, 48, or 72 h (FigureS4). Taken together, our data are consistent with cadaverine treatment leading to decreased biotin synthesis, thereby resulting in decreased biotinylation in BCCP1 protein in both shoots and roots. They are also consistent with decreased biotinylation levels of MCCA protein incdh3mutant roots, as increased MCCA apoprotein abundance is not accompanied by increased levels of biotinylated MCCA (Figure5c). In summary, cadaverine treatment significantly affects the amount of biotinylated BCCP1 protein in both shoots and roots. Lipid composition is altered by cadaverine ACCase requires biotinylation of the BCCP1 subunit to generate malonyl‐CoA from acetyl‐CoA at the first step of fatty acid biosynthesis. The cadaverine‐induced reduction in biotinylated BCCP1 protein in plant tissues is expected to decrease fatty acid production. To test this hypothesis, we determined the impact of cadaverine treatment on the lipid profile of Arabidopsis seedlings. Wild‐type Col‐0 seeds were germinated and grown on control media for 5 days, then transferred to either control media or media containing 200 µmcadaverine, and allowed to grow for 72 more hours, a time previously determined to be sufficient to allow primary root growth inhibition by cadaverine (Figure1). At that time, lipids were extracted from these samples, and subjected to lipidomics analyses by tandem mass spectrometry (Shiva et al.,2013). Total polar lipids as well as diacylglycerol (DAG) and triacylglycerol (TAG) lipids, were analyzed with five biological replicates. Triacylglycerol content following 72 h of cadaverine (Cad) treatment. Columbia‐0 seedlings were germinated on control media and transferred to either control or 200 μmcadaverine‐containing media after 5 days. 72 h post‐treatment, whole seedlings were harvested and used for lipid extraction and analysis using tandem mass spectrometry. The average of five biological replicates are shown containing approximately 200 seedlings per replicate, with dots representing each replicate. Bars indicate standard error. Student’st‐test was done to determine significance between cadaverine treatment and control. *P< 0.05. **P< 0.01. We observed similar levels of total polar lipid species between cadaverine‐treated and control seedlings, with slight decreases observed in total PA and phosphatidylinositol (PI), and an increase in phosphatidylcholine (PC) (TableS1). Although total DAG levels were not altered by cadaverine treatment, specific DAGs changed in abundance in response to cadaverine, including increases in DAG 16:0/16:1, DAG 18:0/16:2 and DAG 18:3/dnOPDA, and decreases in DAG 18:3/18:3 content (TableS1). In addition, we have also seen modification of phospholipids, albeit below the significance threshold, with PI and PA decreasing with cadaverine treatment. As we have shown exogenous biotin rescues the cadaverine response phenotype, the effect of cadaverine treatment on primary root growth is in part associated with induced alterations in lipid composition, including decreased TAG content, and/or signaling phospholipids. Analysis ofSUC5,required for biotin transport into the developing embryo from the maternal plant, shows thesuc5andbio1orbio2double mutants rescued with exogenous biotin have an increased proportion of short chain fatty acids (16:0 and 16:1), in accordance with our observation of cadaverine treatment (Figure6; TableS1) (Pommerrenig et al.,2012). The decrease in PI and PA could be due to increased activity through the phosphoinositide pathway to generate DAG to compensate for decreases in TAG. Alternatively, cadaverine may function to affect the components of the phosphoinositide pathway, independently from its effect on biotin, contributing to the root growth phenotype we see in response to cadaverine. Biotin is also involved in amino acid homeostasis, gluconeogenesis, and other aspects of central metabolism. MCCase has previously been shown to accumulate in response to biotin depletion or starvation to allow for recycling of amino acids (Aubert et al.,1996; Che,2003; Ding et al.,2012). The increase of MCCA apoprotein incdh3(Figure5a,c) is compatible with a mechanism that allows modulation of target MCCA protein abundance by biotin availability, in agreement with previous studies (Che,2003; Li et al.,2012). The absence of such changes in cadaverine‐treated wild‐type plants may simply reflect a lower level of biotin limitation in wild‐type roots. While root growth inhibition ofcdh3was not observed with putrescine‐derived polyamines (Figure1g), thepao4phenotype and subsequent rescue by biotin (Figure3d) suggests a connection between cadaverine and the putrescine‐derived polyamines. Polyamine oxidases, such as PAO4, oxidize polyamines spermidine and spermine, thereby contributing to putrescine‐derived polyamines homeostasis (Kamada‐Nobusada et al.,2008; Liu et al.,2014).pao4mutants show increased spermine content, decreased spermidine and hydrogen peroxide, and changes in primary metabolism (Sequera‐Mutiozabal et al.,2016). Altered primary metabolism associated with thepao4mutation may reflect an indirect role for the putrescine‐derived polyamines or their catabolic products in biotin synthesis or the downstream effects of biotin. The putrescine‐derived polyamines are essential components for growth and development; for example, thermospermine is required for vasculature development in Arabidopsis (Kakehi et al.,2008) and spermidine is required for eukaryotic translation (Park et al.,1982). Studies on the functions of putrescine‐derived polyamines have been hampered by the embryo lethality associated with spermidine depletion (Imai et al.,2004). Therefore, it is possible that putrescine‐derived polyamines provide other essential roles that have yet to be uncovered. OCT1has been characterized as a carnitine transporter and was proposed to transport cations, such as polyamines (Lelandais‐Brière et al.,2007; Strohm et al.,2015). In mammals the carnitine cycle allows acyl transport into the mitochondria for beta‐oxidation. An analogous mechanism has been proposed in plants after identification of a carnitine acyl carrier‐like protein with homology to mammalian carnitine acyl carrier, but the role of carnitine in plants has yet to be further elucidated (Lawand et al.,2002).oct1mutants could be sensitive to cadaverine because of altered polyamines homeostasis and/or localization. Alternatively, cadaverine‐induced lipid deficiency could be exacerbated by altered acyl transport capabilities in theoct1mutants. Seedling root growth measurements Seedlings were grown on plates containing 1.5% agar, 0.5× Linsmaier and Skoog (LS) media pH 5.7 with 1.5% sucrose unless otherwise noted. After 48 h of stratification, plates were moved to a 22°C growth chamber under long day conditions, 60 μmol m–2sec–1white light (cool‐white fluorescent bulbs) and the wave assay was carried out as described in Rutherford and Masson (1996). Day lengths were 16 h. After 6 days of growth, the position of the root tip was marked and seedlings were grown for 4 more days. After 10 days, plates were scanned using a document scanner and the growth from Day 6 to 10 was measured using the Neuron J plugin of ImageJ. Root growth was standardized to the control of each mutant line. To determine if the response was specific to cadaverine, mutant lines were screened on media supplemented with putrescine (5, 10, and 15 mm), spermidine (300, 500, and 700 μm), and spermine (200, 300, and 400 μm), and root growth measurements were carried out as described above. Meristem morphology and cell size Zeiss confocal LSM780 microscope was used to characterize cell size and morphology of cadaverine‐treated roots. Eight‐day‐old seedlings were germinated on control media or 200 μmcadaverine‐containing media. Seedlings were grown as described above. After 8 days in the growth chamber, seedlings were stained with 1.0 mg ml–1propidium iodide for approximately 2 sec and then rinsed with water. Roots were imaged using a 561‐nm laser, 20× objective. Images were analyzed using ImageJ. Meristem was defined from the quiescent center to the first elongated cell in the cortex. The number of cells in the meristem was counted from the quiescent center along files of cortical cells to the first elongated cell (Perilli et al.,2010). The cell length in the mature zone was quantified by measuring cells in the epidermis using ImageJ. Seedlings were germinated on control media (as above) and grown vertically to reduce waving. Three days after germination, seedlings were transferred to control or 200 μmcadaverine‐containing media and grown under 60 μmol m–2sec–1of continuous light. A high‐resolution raspberry pi camera was used to image seedlings every 8 h. Imaging began within 10 min after transfer. ImageJ was used to measure tip growth every 8 h. Statistical difference in root tip growth between cadaverine and control treatment was tested using a mixed effects model with anF‐test for the interaction between time and treatment, corrected with Tukey’s adjustment for multiple comparisons in SAS Studio Version 3.8 (Gueorguieva and Krystal,2004). To generate an EMS population, approximately 0.19 g of Col‐0 seeds (M0) were treated with 50 ml of 0.2% EMS for 15 h, then rinsed with water eight times (Weigel and Glazebrook,2002). On the last wash, seeds were soaked in water for an hour. Seeds were then resuspended in 0.1% agar and pipetted on to soil. After EMS application M0 seeds are referred to as M1. M1 plants were self‐pollinated and M2 seeds were collected in individual pools for each plant. In total, 1064 M2 lines were screened on plates containing LS media supplemented with 200 μmcadaverine. Seedlings showing a hypersensitive response, a decrease in root growth compared with the wild type on cadaverine media, were self‐pollinated and the M3 lines were rescreened on 200 μmcadaverine and control media. Root growth of these M3 lines was quantified as described above. Student’st‐test was done against Col‐0 to determine if the mutant line was hypersensitive to cadaverine (FigureS1). A mapping population ofcdh3was generated by backcrossingcdh3to wild‐type Col‐0. The segregating F2 population was screened on 50 μmcadaverine plates as described above, omitting sucrose. In total, 162 cadaverine hypersensitive seedlings were pooled and frozen in liquid nitrogen, then homogenized with a 4.5‐mm steel bead using Mixmill. DNA was extracted using the QIAGEN DNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Next‐generation sequencing was done using Illumina HiSeq 2000 (UW‐Biotech Facility) with 100 bp, paired‐end reads.dnastarsoftware (version 12.3) was used for alignment and variant identification. Reads with a Q value <30 were removed from analysis. Variants present in multiple EMS mutant lines and Col‐0 were subtracted from thecdh3variant list. The location of the mutation was identified by looking at the percentage single nucleotide polymorphism along the position in the genome (Zuryn et al.,2010). Seedlings were germinated on LS media with or without 200 μmcadaverine and 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, or 100 nmbiotin. Biotin was prepared as described in Schneider et al. (1989). Seedling root growth was quantified as described above. Student’st‐test was done to determine significance against Col‐0 usingP< 0.05 as a cut off. Primers containing adapters forAsc1 andPac1 restriction sites were used to amplify Col‐0 wild‐typeBIO3‐BIO1genomic DNA (At5G57590), from 1233 bp upstream from the transcriptional start site to 382 bp 3′ of the stop codon, yielding a 5706‐bp product. The PCR reaction was restriction‐digested withAsc1 andPac1 and ligated into pMDC99 (Curtis,2003). The ligated product was transformed intoEscherichia coliDUO competent cells (Lucigen, Middleton, WI, USA) and selected on 50 μg ml–1kanamycin. Transformation rescue was done on thecdh3mutant using the floral dip method as described (Clough and Bent,1998) using Agrobacteria strain GV3101. T1 seeds were screened on 50 μg ml–1hygromycin to identify positive transformants. Protein expression and isolation Protein expression of pET‐mBIO3‐BIO1 was carried out as described previously (Cobessi et al.,2012). The plasmid was introduced into Rosetta‐2E. colicompetent cells (Novagen, Madison, WI, USA) and cultured overnight at 37°C, 200 r.p.m. in 10 ml LB medium containing 50 μg ml–1kanamycin. After overnight growth the culture was transferred into 500 ml LB with appropriate antibiotic and supplemented with 10 μmpyridoxine and 15 μmthiamin (Cobessi et al.,2012). The culture was incubated at 37°C until the OD600reached 0.3. At this point, 0.4 mmisopropylthio‐β‐d‐galactoside was added, and the culture was grown for 16 h at 18°C, shaking at 200 rpm. Cells were then harvested by centrifuged at 4°C for 20 min at 4000g. Pellet was resuspend in lysis buffer with additional 1× protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) and 500 μmPLP. Cell lysate was centrifuged at 10 000gfor 30 min at 4°C. Supernatant was collected and subjected to QIAexpress Ni‐NTA column purification (Qiagen). Eluted protein was desalted using Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter units, Ultra‐15 MWCO 50 kDa (Millipore Sigma, Burlington, MA, USA). Protein was stored and diluted in 100 mmHEPPS pH 8.6. BIO3‐BIO1in vitroenzymatic assay The assay was modified from the method developed by Cobessi et al. (2012). Reaction buffer contained the following: 100 mmHEPPS pH 8.6, 1 mmDTT, 100 mmNaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 3 mmAdoMet, 10 mmNaHCO3, and 0.3 mmATP. Each reaction included various concentrations of racemic hydrochloride‐KAPA (synthesized according to the procedure described by Nudelman et al. (2004) as substrate (0 or 20 µm), along with 0 or 50 µmcadaverine dihydrochloride. The BIO3‐BIO1 enzyme at a final concentration of 6.9 µmwas added to start the reactions. Reactions were run at 25°C for 8 min. At the end of each reaction, the enzyme was inactivated by addition of 20% acetic acid. Inactivated enzyme was removed from the reaction using a 10‐kDa column (Pall NanoSep). DTB was detected using FluoReporter Biotin Quantitation Assay Kit (F30751; Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA). Twenty‐five microliters of reaction product was mixed with 25 µl 2× Biotective Green Reagent and incubated for 5 min in the dark before detection using a Tecan Infinite M1000 Pro microplate reader with 495 nm (10 nm bandwidth) excitation and 530 nm (10 nm bandwidth) emission. A standard curve of DTB was generated from 0 to 80 pmol and used to determine the amount of DTB per sample. Seedling growth for gene expression analysis Seedlings were germinated on control media and transferred to plates containing control or 200 μmcadaverine media for 24, 48, or 72 h before collecting tissue at 8 days after germination. An additional subset of seedlings was germinated directly on control or 200 μmcadaverine media. To harvest, seedlings were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and homogenized using a 4.5‐mm steel bead and a Mixmill. RNA extraction was done using TRIzol reagent and Direct‐zol RNA MiniPrep Kit, with a chloroform phase separation, according to manufacturer’s specifications (ZymoResearch, Irvine, CA, USA). cDNA synthesis was done using SuperScript III. qRT‐PCR was done using Bullseye EvaGreen qPCR Mastermix (MidSci) and run on a LightCycler 480 II Instrument (Roche). Gene expression was calculated by the delta deltaCtmethod and standardized to the PP2A (At1G59830) reference gene (Czechowski et al.,2005; Ramakers et al.,2003). Fold‐change of expression for all samples was then set relative to a control sample. Statistical significance was identified by ANOVA with Tukey’s HSD correction (SAS version 9.3). Seedling growth is as described above, with seedlings germinated on 1.5% agar, 0.5× LS media pH 5.7 with 1.5% sucrose with or without or 200 μmcadaverine. Tissue was frozen using dry ice after 8 days of growth. Frozen samples were homogenized using MixMill. Protein was extracted in the equivalent of 1 ml of protein extraction buffer (20 mmMOPS [pH 7.5], 5 mmMgCl2, 5 mmKCl, 50 mmSucrose [Roche inhibitor cocktail tablet], 1 mmDTT, 7% glycerol [adapted from (Li et al.,2012]) per 250 mg of tissue. The homogenate was gently mixed at 4°C for 30 min, then centrifuged at 4°C for 30 min, 18 000gto pellet the debris. Total protein was quantified and standardized for each gel using the Roche BCA assay. Approximately 150 μg of protein was loaded on to a 12% Tris‐Bis NuPAGE gel (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA) and run using the Invitrogen X‐cell SureLock Mini‐Cell Electrophoresis System. After electroblotting, the Immunobilon‐FL PVDF membrane was blocked for 1 h at 4°C with a 5% milk/TBS solution (25 mmTris‐HCl, 140 mmNaCl, 3.0 mmKCl). Anti‐RPT4A, a proteasome subunit‐specific antibody generated in rabbit, was used as a loading control at 1:4000 dilution. BIO3‐BIO1 antibody was generated against guinea pig by Claude Alban and used at 1:25 000 (Cobessi et al.,2012). BCCP1 and MCCA antibodies were generated against rabbit by Basil Nikolau and obtained from the Plant Antibody Facility (PAF, Ohio State) (Che,2003; Li et al.,2011). MCCA and BCCP1 antibodies were used at a concentration of 1:10 000. LiCor CW800, secondary antibodies were used according to manufacturer’s instructions at 1:10 000 dilution. Membranes were scanned using LICOR Odyssey. Image studio software version 5.2.5 and Adobe Photoshop was used to quantify band intensity. Biotin‐containing protein analysis Biotin‐containing proteins were quantified following protocol from Li et al. (2012). RPT4A loading control was used as described above. Membranes were blocked in TBST with 1% Tween20 before treating with streptavidin. Streptavadin CW800 was used to detect biotinylated proteins at a concentration of 0.5 µg ml–1in 1% milk TBST. Col‐0 wild‐type seedlings were grown on LS media as described above. After 5 days in the growth chamber, seedlings were transferred to plates containing control or 200 μmcadaverine media, and allowed to grow for an additional 72 h. Fresh tissue was submerged immediately in 75°C isopropanol with 0.01% butylated hydroxytoluene. Lipid extraction procedure was done according to Devaiah et al. (2006). Samples were dried under nitrogen gas and shipped to Kansas State Lipidomics Research Center for analysis (Vu et al.,2014). Lipids were standardized to dry weight for each sample. Total acyl lipids, DAG and TAG were analyzed on a Waters Xevo TQS mass spectrometer (Waters, Milford, MA, USA). Samples contained 200 seedlings per biological replica, with a total of five biological repeats.
