Obesity is characterized by an increased recruitment of proinflammatory macrophages to the adipose tissue (AT), leading to systemic inflammation and metabolic disease. The pathogenesis of this AT inflammation, however, remains to be elucidated. The circulating adipokine leptin is increased in obesity and is involved in immune cell function and activation. In the present study, we investigated the role of leptin in the induction of obesity-associated inflammation. We generated radiation chimeric C57BL/6J mice reconstituted with either leptin receptor-deficient (db/db) or wild-type (WT) bone marrow and challenged them with a high-fat diet (HFD) for 16 weeks. Mice reconstituted withdb/dbbone marrow (WT/db), had significantly lower body weight and adiposity compared with mice with WT bone marrow (WT/WT). Gonadal AT in WT/db mice displayed a 2-fold lower expression of the inflammatory genesTnfa,Il6, andCcl2. In addition, gonadal fat of WT/db mice contained significantly fewer crown-like structures compared with WT/WT mice, and most of their AT macrophages expressed macrophage galactose-type C type lectin 1 (MGL1) and were C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2)-negative, indicative of an anti-inflammatory phenotype. Moreover, WT/db mice exhibited greater insulin sensitivity compared with WT/WT mice. These data show that disrupted leptin signaling in bone marrow-derived cells attenuates the proinflammatory conditions that mediate many of the metabolic complications that characterize obesity. Our findings establish a novel mechanism involved in the regulation of obesity-associated systemic inflammation and support the hypothesis that leptin is a proinflammatory cytokine. Obesity is positively correlated with a plethora of inflammatory diseases and a higher susceptibility to infections (1). Therefore, investigating the link between obesity and immune system function is of utmost importance. The close interplay between metabolic and inflammatory pathways is beneficial under physiological conditions but becomes deleterious with either nutrient scarcity or nutrient excess (2). Indeed, obesity is characterized by a state of low-grade inflammation (3) in which increased levels of inflammatory markers and leptin prevail in the expanding adipose tissue (AT) (4,5). This chronic low-grade inflammation is believed to be the origin of most the obesity-associated diseases (2). Macrophages have been identified as the major secretory cells in AT, contributing to systemic and local inflammation in obesity (6,7). AT macrophage (ATM) recruitment is increased dramatically with the expansion of fat mass, comprising up to 50% of AT cells in the obese state (6). In addition to being more numerous in obese subjects, ATMs differ in localization, phenotype, and function between lean and obese individuals. In the lean state, resident (type II) macrophages display an anti-inflammatory phenotype with high gene expression ofIl10,Mgl1(macrophage galactose-type-C-type lectin 1), andArg1(8). Type II macrophages are mouse EGF-like module containing mucin-like hormone receptor-like 1 positive (F4/80+), cluster of differentiation molecule 11c negative (CD11c−), MGL1+(CD301) (9), and dispersed in the interstitial space between adipocytes (10) where they are believed to play a role in preserving AT integrity and maintenance. Conversely, obesity-recruited (type I) macrophages display a proinflammatory phenotype (9), have a high level of expression ofTnfa,Il6andNos2(11) transcripts, and are F4/80+, CD11c+, and MGL1−(8,12). These cells form what is known as crown-like structures (CLSs) surrounding adipocytes and are involved in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance (13). Although macrophage involvement in AT inflammation with obesity is well characterized, little is known about the mechanistic basis for ATM accumulation. Leptin is involved in both innate and adaptive immunity (14). The long leptin receptor isoform (LepRb), responsible for leptin's physiological activities (15), has been identified on most immune cells including monocytes and macrophages (16–19). Leptin-deficient (ob/ob) and leptin receptor-deficient (db/db) mice exhibit less macrophage infiltration and inflammatory gene expression in AT, despite increased weight gain and adiposity (7). Moreover, obesity is accompanied by sustained elevated circulating concentrations of leptin, resulting in leptin resistance (20). In the present study, we investigated whether leptin signaling in white blood cells was involved in the recruitment of proinflammatory ATMs in diet-induced obesity. We demonstrated that the absence of leptin-receptor signaling in white blood cells led to reduced weight gain and adiposity and improved insulin sensitivity in high-fat diet (HFD)-feddb/dbbone marrow-transplanted wild-type (WT) mice compared with HFD-fed mice that received WT bone marrow transplants. Mice that receiveddb/dbbone marrow also exhibited decreased AT inflammation. Insulin, leptin, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, IL-6, and TNF-α were measured in serum of fasted mice by fluorescent immunoassay using a Milliplex MAP kit (Millipore) at 0, 8, and 16 weeks of dietary treatment. Fasting blood glucose was measured at each blood withdrawal using a digital glucometer (Contour Blood Glucose Monitoring System; Bayer). The homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated using the following formula: fasting blood glucose (milligrams per deciliter) × fasting insulin (microunits per milliliter)/405 (22). RNA isolation and gene expression quantification AT RNA was extracted with the Trizol method. RNAs were reverse transcribed into cDNA with the RT2First Strand cDNA Kit (SABiosciences). AT cDNA was used to measure transcripts of interest by real-time PCR using a customized SYBR Green real-time PCR detection superarray from SABiosciences. Sequences coding forTnfa,Il6,Ccl2,Ccr2,Mgl1, andLepwere targeted by the assay.Actb(β-actin), used as the internal standard for normalization and reverse transcription, and genomic DNA were assessed for each sample as quality controls. Gonadal white AT (gWAT) was digested as previously described (23), and the stromal-vascular fraction (SVF) pellet was collected. Cells were blocked with 50% normal goat serum in PBS for 30 minutes at 4°C and incubated with F4/80 and CD11b antibodies for 1 hour at 4°C followed by 2 washes in PBS. ATMs were then sorted by coexpression of F4/80 and CD11b using a MoFLO XDP cell sorter (Becton Dickinson). Samples from gWAT were fixed in 10% formaldehyde for 24 hours before embedding in paraffin. Sections (10 μm thick) were cut and deparaffinized with xylene and decreasing concentrations of ethanol. Antigen retrieval was performed by immersing the slides in citrate buffer (10mM citric acid, 0.05% Tween 20 [pH 6.0]) for 30 minutes at 90°C to 95°C. Sections were stained overnight at 4°C with antimouse F4/80, MGL1, and C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2) antibodies (AbD Serotec). Sections were examined using a laser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 5 PASCAL). Data are displayed as mean ± SEM. Mean comparison analysis was performed using a simplettest. All analyses was performed using SPSS software. For all analyses, statistical significance was considered atP< .05. Effect of bone marrow leptin receptor deficiency on body weight and body composition Anthropometric and food intake of WT/WT and WT/db mice on an HFD. A–C, WT male mice reconstituted with leptin receptor-deficient (WT/db) bone marrow gained significantly less weight at the end of a 16-week HFD challenge (A), with a significantly different cumulative weight gain (B) and significantly lower ratio adipose tissue pads to body weight (C) compared with controls (WT/WT).

In summary, the data presented support the hypothesis that leptin signaling in bone marrow-derived cells is important for the development of the AT inflammation that accompanies obesity and possibly the pathogenesis of insulin resistance.
