Ferl,robferl@ufl.edu This article was submitted to Plant Abiotic Stress, a section of the journal Frontiers in Plant Science Received 2019 Sep 7; Accepted 2020 Feb 17; Collection date 2020. The observation that plant roots skew in microgravity recently refuted the long-held conviction that skewing was a gravity-dependent phenomenon. Further, spaceflight root skewing suggests that specific root morphologies and cell wall remodeling systems may be important aspects of spaceflight physiological adaptation. However, connections between skewing, cell wall modification and spaceflight physiology are currently based on inferences rather than direct tests. Therefore, the Advanced Plant Experiments-03-2 (APEX-03-2) spaceflight study was designed to elucidate the contribution of two skewing- and cell wall-associated genes in Arabidopsis to root behavior and gene expression patterns in spaceflight, to assess whether interruptions of different skewing pathways affect the overall spaceflight-associated process. SPIRAL1 is a skewing-related protein implicated in directional cell expansion, and functions by regulating cortical microtubule dynamics. SKU5 is skewing-related glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein of the plasma membrane and cell wall implicated in stress response signaling. These two genes function in different cellular pathways that affect skewing on the Earth, and enable a test of the relevance of skewing pathways to spaceflight physiological adaptation. In this study, bothsku5andspr1mutants showed different skewing behavior and markedly different patterns of gene expression in the spaceflight environment. Thespr1mutant showed fewer differentially expressed genes than its Col-0 wild-type, whereassku5showed considerably more than its WS wild-type. Developmental age played a substantial role in spaceflight acclimation in all genotypes, but particularly insku5plants, where spaceflight 4d seedlings had almost 10-times as many highly differentially expressed genes as the 8d seedlings. These differences demonstrated that the two skewing pathways represented bySKU5andSPR1have unique and opposite contributions to physiological adaptation to spaceflight. Thespr1response is less intense than wild type, suggesting that the loss of SPR1 positively impacts spaceflight adaptation. Conversely, the intensity of thesku5responses suggests that the loss of SKU5 initiates a much more complex, deeper and more stress related response to spaceflight. This suggests that proper SKU5 function is important to spaceflight adaptation. Spaceflight studies offer unique insights into plant biological processes, and enable the exploration of the relationships between root morphology, gene expression and the physiological adaptation to spaceflight. The developmental patterns of plant organs are continuously altered through perception of the environment, signal integration, and response to environmental stimuli. A diversity of tropic gradients influence the path of growth in roots by initiating localized, asymmetrical changes in cell elongation. These changes are primarily brought about through hormonal interactions and subsequent remodeling of cell physiology (Roy and Bassham, 2014;Vandenbrink et al., 2014;Schultz et al., 2017). Root skewing and waving are phenomena in which root growth deviates from a gravity vector throughout its development, and which vary between theArabidopsis thaliana(Arabidopsis) ecotypes Columbia (Col-0) and Wassilewskija (WS) (Rutherford and Masson, 1996;Roy and Bassham, 2014;Schultz et al., 2017). Although once thought to be a gravity-dependent growth behavior (Oliva and Dunand, 2007), skewing occurs in the microgravity of spaceflight (Paul et al., 2012a). This suggests that skewing is independent of both the tropic force of gravity and the gravity-induced contact forces between roots and growth media (Millar et al., 2011;Paul et al., 2012a,2013;Nakashima et al., 2014). Therefore, the spaceflight environment provides a unique and relevant context in which to study genes associated with skewing phenotypes. Plants grown in the spaceflight environment exhibit complex and unique gene expression patterns (e.g.,Paul et al., 2005;Paul et al., 2012b,2013,2017;Correll et al., 2013;Kwon et al., 2015;Johnson et al., 2017;Choi et al., 2019). The predominant feature of the spaceflight environment is microgravity. The lack of gravity has a direct effect on plant cells and signal transduction; this direct effect represents a novel environment for plants, and any terrestrial organism, and appears to be generally perceived as stressful. In addition, microgravity imposes secondary environmental stresses due to the disruption of fluid movement, and any processes influenced by convection, such as gas exchange and temperature redistribution. Combinatorial stresses induce changes in gene expression and tolerance that are not fully recapitulated by exposure to the individual stressors (e.g.,Ramegowda and Senthil-Kumar, 2015;Suzuki et al., 2016). Thus it is important to think of the spaceflight environment as more complex than microgravity alone. Several classes of stress response genes have been identified as consistently involved in the response to spaceflight across ecotypes of Arabidopsis via analyses of gene expression. Heat shock genes are often induced by spaceflight (Paul et al., 2005,2012b;Salmi and Roux, 2008;Shagimardanova et al., 2010;Zupanska et al., 2013,2017,2019;Johnson et al., 2017;Choi et al., 2019). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling and scavenging processes are also common in the spaceflight response, though ROS-associated genes have been observed as both up- and downregulated in spaceflight (Shagimardanova et al., 2010;Correll et al., 2013;Paul et al., 2013,2017;Kwon et al., 2015;Choi et al., 2019;Zhou et al., 2019). Some stress gene expression changes are also associated with spaceflight-induced changes in the Arabidopsis methylome (Zhou et al., 2019). Cell wall remodeling processes are enriched in spaceflight gene expression datasets (Paul et al., 2012b,2013,2017;Correll et al., 2013;Kwon et al., 2015;Johnson et al., 2017). Cell wall remodeling genes, typically associated with biotic stress and pathogen defense pathways, also contribute to spaceflight acclimation (Paul et al., 2012b,2013,2017;Correll et al., 2013;Choi et al., 2019). Spaceflight also affects abundances of proteins of defense pathways and cell wall remodeling (Mazars et al., 2014;Ferl et al., 2015). However, the particular genetic pathways activated and repressed in spaceflight vary among ecotypes of Arabidopsis, demonstrating that there are significant genotypic contributions to spaceflight physiological adaptation (Paul et al., 2017;Beisel et al., 2019;Choi et al., 2019). Mutations in genes associated with stress response and signaling pathways can significantly alter the differential gene expression profiles of spaceflight physiological adaptation. Single gene mutations in heat shock transcription factors, gravity perception genes, and light signaling genes in Arabidopsis seedlings and cultures exhibit altered spaceflight responses (Paul et al., 2017;Zupanska et al., 2017,2019). Therefore, we sought to understand better the relationships among spaceflight responses, root morphology, and spaceflight adaptation by exploring the spaceflight responses of two single gene skewing-related mutant lines:spiral1andsku5. SKU5 and SPR1 are therefore very different proteins in seemingly unrelated physiological processes, but both proteins have roles in root skewing. Both of these proteins are also associated with cell wall remodeling, a process that is regularly involved in spaceflight acclimation. As such, these genes offer an appropriate initial genetic dissection of root skewing and the effect of skewing pathways in the microgravity of spaceflight environments. Extensive discussion of the relevance of skewing and waving in microgravity has been presented elsewhere (e.g.,Paul et al., 2012a), but to paraphrase from that paper, prior to spaceflight research, the consensus was that gravitropism was the directional driver in skewing (e.g.,Simmons et al., 1995;Oliva and Dunand, 2007). Yet we now know that gravity is not required, and root skewing in spaceflight appears to be an inherent feature of many Arabidopsis ecotypes, even in conditions lacking both light and gravity (Millar et al., 2011;Paul et al., 2012a,2017;Nakashima et al., 2014). These observations suggest a testable relationship among root morphologies governed by skewing regulation pathways. The hypothesis is that skewing pathways play a large role in spaceflight adaptation via the inherent cell wall remodeling that accompanies those morphologies and the physiological adaptation to spaceflight. This relationship was examined by growingspr1,sku5and their wild type controls for 4 and 8 days on the International Space Station and at the Kennedy Space Center, then observing both their growth morphologies and gene expression profiles in response to spaceflight as measures of response quality and complexity. A change in gene expression or morphology during spaceflight would suggest a significant role for these skewing genes in the physiological adaptation process. Differential gene expression profiles are often deployed as measures of the underlying gene expression changes needed for physiological adaptation and developmental changes within an organism. Differential gene expression responses, in terms of the number of genes involved and their fold-change levels, may be considered a measure of the metabolic cost of adapting to that environment (e.g.:Chan et al., 2016). Therefore gene expression profiles morphologies were used to examine the relationships between skewing genes and the resulting complexity of spaceflight acclimation. SKU5 and SPR1 function in different cellular pathways that affect skewing on the Earth, which enabled a test of the relevance of contrasting skewing pathways to spaceflight physiological adaptation. Growth morphologies were used to examine the productivity and developmental success of these genotypes in spaceflight. Plant Material and Plate Setup Spaceflight Experimental Workflow Advanced Plant Experiments-03-2 overview.(A)Images detailing the standard procedures used onboard the ISS during the experiment. In Panel 1, the Vegetable Production System (VPS, “Veggie”) and its local environment can be seen, while panel 2 provides a close-up of the plate setup inside Veggie after insertion. Panel 3 shows astronaut Butch Wilmore harvesting seedlings into a KFT (Kennedy Space Center Fixation Tube), and the workstation used for the orbital harvests. The images of the Veggie hardware and Butch Wilmore were taken on the ISS by NASA; all NASA photos are in the public domain.(B)Full images of plates taken at the time of harvest and from which tissue was used in the APEX-03-2 RNA-Seq experiment. Images from the ground control are in the top two rows, while those from the spaceflight experiment are in the bottom two rows. The genotype and developmental age of the seedlings are listed on each image. The provided images were taken from above the surface of the growth medium. The ground control (GC) for the experiment, composed of an identical set of plants and plates, was performed on a 48-h delay at KSC using Veggie hardware within the ISS Environmental Simulator (ISSES) chamber. The same growth timeline was used, with seedlings being imaged and harvested into RNAlater-containing KFTs at 4d and 8d time points. The GC operations were as described above for the spaceflight experiment, with KSC personnel following the precise timing of the astronaut activities. Telemetry data also enabled the ISSES chamber to replicate the CO2levels, temperature, and ambient lighting in the vicinity of the Veggie hardware onboard the ISS across the course of the experiment. The spaceflight and GC seedlings, stored in RNAlater, were transferred from −80°C storage to 4°C overnight to thaw. Seedlings in RNAlater were examined with an Olympus SZX12 stereoscope (Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) and whole roots were dissected away from the shoot and hypocotyl. The remaining shoot and hypocotyl tissues were restored to −80°C in RNAlater. RNA was prepared from 5–8 4d plant roots, and 2–3 8d plant roots. Total RNA was extracted using the Qiashredder and RNAeasy kits from QIAGEN (QIAGEN Sciences, MD, United States) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. An on-column digestion with RNase-free DNase (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany) was used to remove residual DNA. Library preparation was performed at the University of Florida’s Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research (ICBR) Gene Expression Core. RNA integrity was verified using the Agilent 2100 BioAnalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, United States). Of the total RNA, 10 ng were used to construct cDNA libraries with the ClonTech SMART-Seq v4 ultra-low input RNA kit for sequencing (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Cat#: 634890), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 1st strand cDNA was primed by the SMART-Seq v4 oligonucleotide, which then base-pairs with these additional nucleotides, creating an extended template. The reverse transcriptase then switches templates and continues transcribing to the end of the oligonucleotide, resulting full-length cDNA that contains an anchor sequence that serves as a universal priming site for second strand synthesis. Then, cDNA was amplified with primer II A for 8 PCR cycles. Illumina sequencing libraries were then generated with 150 pg of cDNA using the Illumina Nextera DNA Sample Preparation Kit (Cat#: FC-131-1024) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 150 pg of cDNA were fragmented by tagmentation reaction and adapter sequences were added onto template cDNA by PCR amplification. Libraries were quantitated using both the 2100 BioAnalyzer and qPCR (Kapa Biosystems, catalog number: KK4824). Sequencing experiments were performed at the UF ICBR Next-Generation DNA Sequencing Core. In preparation for sequencing, barcoded libraries were sized on the 2100 BioAnalyzer, and quantitated by QUBIT (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States) and qPCR (Kapa Biosystems, catalog number: KK4824). Individual libraries were pooled equimolarly at 4 nM. This “working pool” was used as input in the NextSeq500 instrument sample preparation protocol (Illumina, Part#: 15048776, Rev A). Typically, a 1.3 pM library concentration resulted in an optimal clustering density in our instrument (i.e., ∼200,000 clusters per mm2). Samples were sequenced on 5 flow cells (5 NextSeq500 runs), using a 2 × 75 cycles (paired-end) configuration. A typical sequencing run in the NextSeq500 produced 750–800 million paired-end reads with a Q30 ≥ 85%. For RNA-Seq, around 40 million paired-end reads per sample provided sufficient depth for transcriptome analysis (Tarazona et al., 2011). Bioinformatic processing of the sequencing data was performed at the UF ICBR Bioinformatics Core. Fastq files were trimmed to remove sequencing adapters and low-quality base calls using Trimmomatic (version 0.36) with the parameters: LEADING:3, TRAILING:3, SLIDINGWINDOW:4:15, MINLEN:50 (Bolger et al., 2014). Quality control of the trimmed reads was performed using FastQC (version 0.11.2) (Andrews, 2010). Reads for each set of Arabidopsis lines were aligned to their respective reference genomes using the STAR aligner (version 2.5.1b) (Dobin et al., 2012). The Col-0 TAIR10 genome release was used for reads from Col-0 andspr1(Lamesch et al., 2011;Berardini et al., 2015), while reads from WS andsku5were aligned to the WS reference genome (Gan et al., 2011). Duplicate reads resulting from PCR artifacts were then removed using the Picard MarkDuplicates tool (Broad Institute, 2019b). In total, 502 million transcriptomic reads were aligned. Following alignment, expression quantification and differential gene expression analysis were performed using Cufflinks and Cuffdiff (version 2.2.1), respectively, with default parameters (Trapnell et al., 2010,2012). Output from Cuffdiff was then parsed with custom scripts to generate the final annotated tables of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). A cut-off false-discovery rate (FDR) of 0.05 was used for calling statistical significance in differential gene expression Measurements of Seedling Roots Quantification of APEX-03-2 Root Growth. Images acquired at the time of harvest of spaceflight (FLT) and ground control (GC) plants were used for measurements. Primary root length measurements for(A)Col-0 andspr1and(B)WS andsku5were taken using Jfilament and analyzed in R. Significant differences between genotypes (spr1vs. Col-0,sku5vs. WS) and growth conditions (FLT vs. GC) were assessed via two-tailedt-tests and are indicated by asterisks above bars connecting the relevant sets of measurements (Bonferroni correction:∗p< 0.0125;∗∗p< 0.001). The 8d Col-0 FLT vs. GC comparison did not meet this cutoff (p= 0.0151). Error bars show the SEM of each set of measurements.(C)The angle measured between the root tip and the initial direction of root growth in the 4-day-old seedlings. Plots are separated into rows by growth condition, and into columns by genotype. Positive and negative angles represent rightward and leftward growth of roots, respectively, when viewed from behind the media. Angles are binned in 10° intervals, with each bar’s length representing the number of roots within that bin. As such, a bar reaching the second ring of each plot represents ten roots within that bin. However, note that the upper limit of bin size is lowered in the spaceflight plots to accommodate the higher variation in these data. The total number of roots represented in each plot is indicated in its bottom-right corner, and the mean angle of each plot is noted in its bottom-left corner. FLT, spaceflight; GC, ground control.

Data are based on four biological replicates. Spr1Skews Leftward on Earth and Moreso in Space SPR1 binds with another microtubule plus-end tracking protein, EB1b (Galva et al., 2014). It has been postulated that EB1b and SPR1 work in concert to regulate mechanical force-based directional growth with a balance of gravitropism and thigmotropism, where SPR1 participates in the reinforcement of rightward growth through thigmotropic processes, while EB1b negatively regulates thigmotropism and positively regulates gravitropism (Galva et al., 2014). In an environment lacking a gravity cue such as spaceflight, this gravitropic reinforcement has no effect, resulting in the enhanced skewing ofspr1.Similarly elevated leftward skewing ofspr1occurs under cold conditions alongside alterations of the microtubule network, and skewing is conversely suppressed by heat or salt treatments (Furutani et al., 2000;Sedbrook et al., 2004). The elevated skewing seen inspr1may therefore be the result of spaceflight-induced signals in the root which are similar to those involved in cold response signaling. The microtubule-associated protein MAP65-1 is more abundant in spaceflight, and is also hypothesized to be linked to cold-responsive microtubule stabilization (Chen et al., 2016;Soga et al., 2018). Actin cytoskeleton mutants also exhibit a greater degree of skewing in microgravity when compared to wild-type and GC plants, though this skewing occurs to the right when regarded from behind the media (Nakashima et al., 2014). These structural systems both appear to have roles in suppressing endogenous root skewing patterns in spaceflight. The spaceflight-enhanced skewing ofspr1may therefore be attributed to its altered microtubule dynamics in the spaceflight response, similar to altered dynamics induced by terrestrial cold stress. Sku5Skews Inappropriately in Spaceflight Differential Gene Expression as a Measure of the Quantity and Character of the Physiological Adaptation to Spaceflight Differential gene expression profiles reveal the underlying gene expression changes needed for physiological adaptation to environmental changes. There are numerous, well-documented environmentally-induced gene expression profiles in plants, all of which detail specific physiological changes related to the specific stresses. The intensity of the differential gene expression response, in terms of the number of genes involved and their fold-change levels, may be considered a measure of the metabolic cost of adapting to that environment. A terrestrial example of this metabolic cost is in the transcriptomic response to cold stress in Arabidopsis lines that are either sensitive or resistant to cold (Chan et al., 2016). Plants that overexpressed RNA-DIRECTED DNA METHYLATION 4 (RDM4) had a cold-tolerant phenotype, and exhibited a greatly reduced transcriptomic response to cold stress compared to the more cold-sensitive wild-type andrdm4knock-out plants (Chan et al., 2016). The plants that were least able to tolerate cold environments displayed a far higher number (up to 100×) of differentially expressed genes in response to cold than the cold-tolerant plants exposed to the same environment (Chan et al., 2016). Sku5Mutation Produces a Dramatic Increase in Differential Gene Expression in Spaceflight Differentially expressed genes between FLT and GC of particular interest. Statistically significant DEGs with greater than twofold magnitude in at least one context. Each gene in this list corresponded to the following categories: potential and highly probable skew gene candidates (Skewing, HPSGC;Schultz et al., 2017), late embryogenesis abundant (LEA;Hundertmark and Hincha, 2008), associated with gravitropism (GO Terms;Carbon et al., 2008), and abscisic acid (ABA, GO Terms;Carbon et al., 2008). The heat map scale Log2(Fold-Change) is indicated in the bottom right corner. Categorical information is provided beside each gene group. Data are based on four biological replicates. Spr1Mutation Produces a Decrease in Differential Gene Expression in Spaceflight Many abiotic stresses trigger remodeling of cortical microtubules, with salt stress tolerance requiring the 26S proteasome-mediated degradation of SPR1 (Shoji et al., 2006;Wang et al., 2011;Chen et al., 2016). Microtubule reorientation also contributes to cell elongation in the spaceflight response of hypocotyls (Soga et al., 2018). Thespr1mutant, which has altered microtubule dynamics in favor of decreased stability, may have enhanced capabilities for remodeling of microtubule networks in the response to many forms of environmental stress (Galva et al., 2014). Spr1andSku5Mutants Both Differentially Regulate Skewing-Associated Genes in Response to Spaceflight The physiological adaptation ofsku5to spaceflight is characterized by powerful stress responses, as well as the strong induction of LEAs and other genes associated with seed development. In contrast tosku5,spr1differentially expressed fewer genes than Col-0 to physiologically adapt to spaceflight. This observation suggests that thespr1mutation imbued an enhanced ability for rapid spaceflight acclimation whilesku5required an extended spaceflight response to accomplish acclimation, even to the point of initiating classic deep stress responses. These observations further suggest that the functional distinctions betweensku5andspr1inform distinct aspects of the spaceflight response in plants, in particular the responses of young seedlings. The dramatic responses ofsku5suggest that lipid raft nanodomains of the plasma membrane and their associated GPI-APs play important roles in spaceflight physiological adaptation. The fact thatsku5andspr1show markedly different gene expression patterns in spaceflight suggests that the two skewing pathways highlighted by SKU5 and SPR1 differentially affect the mechanisms used by plants to physiologically acclimate to spaceflight. Sincespr1andsku5root lengths are not altered by spaceflight, the effects of these mutations lie not in the process of growth, but in the processes that direct morphology and structure, likely tying together the large number of cell wall remodeling genes observed as differentially expressed in spaceflight. The data from APEX-03-2 therefore provide an initial functional dissection of the spaceflight response in roots, one that allows an integration of pathways associated with root directionality, morphology and physiological responses to spaceflight.
