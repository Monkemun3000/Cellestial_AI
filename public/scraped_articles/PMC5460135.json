These findings could help explain why astronauts are at a greater risk for dental diseases when in space. Kelly Rice and colleagues from the University of Florida, Gainesville, USA, culturedStreptococcus mutansbacteria under simulated microgravity and normal gravity conditions. The bacteria grown in microgravity were more susceptible to killing with hydrogen peroxide, tended to aggregate in more compact cellular structures, showed changes in their metabolite profile and expressed around 250 genes at levels that were either much higher or lower than normal gravity control cultures. These genes included many involved in carbohydrate metabolism, protein production and stress responses. The observed changes collectively suggest that space flight and microgravity could alter the cavities-causing potential ofS. mutans. S. mutansHARV growth curves and cell aggregation To probe the effect of simulated microgravity growth onS. mutans, continuous growth curves (whereby cell samples were removed from the same HARV at different time points) were performed (n= 3 independent experiments each) in biofilm media (BM) containing 11 mM glucose and 10 mM sucrose over a 24 h period. In this analysis, no statistically significant differences in CFU/ml at each time point were observed (Supplemental Fig.S1). An initial decrease in CFU/ml was observed in both the simulated microgravity and normal gravity HARV cultures betweent= 0 (time of inoculation) andt= 2 h growth, which was likely a function of sucrose-dependent cell aggregation. Very small differences in cell viability patterns in early stationary phase (6–8 h growth) suggest that the simulated microgravity HARV culture may have entered stationary phase slightly sooner than the normal gravity HARV culture in this experiment. As well, the simulated microgravity culture persisted in stationary phase until approximately 12 h growth, followed by a somewhat rapid death phase, with a 1-log loss of viability between 12 and 24 h growth. In contrast, the viability of normal gravity culture underwent a more gradual decrease in cell viability between 12 and 24 h of growth. Monitoring of cell growth by CFU/ml in the continuous growth curve experiments described above required constant disruption of the HARV cultures, making it difficult to assess potential macroscopic differences in cell aggregation in the simulated microgravity and normal gravity conditions. Therefore, these growth curves were also performed using an “end-point” approach, whereby simulated microgravity and normal gravity HARV cultures (n= 2 independent experiments per time point per growth condition) were grown undisturbed in replicate HARV vessels fort= 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, and 48 h (Fig.1). Using this end-point approach, no significant differences in CFU/ml were observed between the simulated microgravity and normal gravity HARV cultures at the assessed time points (Fig.1), and the initial drop in CFU/ml observed early in the growth curves of the continuous cultures (Supplemental Fig.S1) was not observed in these end-point cultures. As well, both the simulated microgravity and normal gravity cultures underwent the same pattern of growth when monitored with this end-point approach: Log phase growth occurred between 0 and 6 h, and both cultures were in early stationary phase at 8 h growth, followed by entry into late stationary phase/death phase between 24 and 48 h growth. Interestingly, differences in macroscopic cell aggregation were consistently observed between the simulated microgravity and normal gravity HARV conditions when using the end-point growth analysis. Specifically, the simulated microgravity condition tended to form round/compact cellular structures, whereas the aggregates in the normal gravity growth condition tended to form less compact structures (Fig.2). RepresentativeS. mutansend-point HARV cultures grown for 8 h in biofilm media under simulated microgravity (a) and normal gravity (b) conditions. Note the structural differences of the self-aggregating bacterial cells under each condition (indicated byarrows) Metabolomics analysis of “end-point” HARV cultures To monitor potential differences in the metabolome of simulated microgravity and normal gravity HARV cultures, cell pellets and culture supernatants were harvested from a second end-point HARV culture experiment (n= 3 independent experiments per time point per growth condition) att= 4,t= 8, andt= 24 h samples, corresponding to log-phase, early stationary phase, and late stationary/death phase, respectively(Supplemental Fig.S2). Given that macroscopic differences in the self-aggregating clusters ofS. mutanscells were consistently observed at thet= 8 h time point (Fig.2), RNA-seq analysis was also performed on thet= 8 h samples. Principle component analysis (PCA) of metabolomics data generated fromt= 4, 8, and 24 h HARV cultures (Supplemental FilesS2andS3) revealed a strong relationship between the time of growth (t= 4, 8, and 24 h) and metabolite profile for each of the simulated microgravity and normal gravity cultures (Fig.3). However, a much weaker “time-treatment” relationship existed when comparing the metabolite profile between simulated microgravity vs. normal gravity cultures at each time point. Welch’s two samplettests revealed 8, 14, and 10 statistically significant differences (p≤ 0.05) in cellular metabolite production between cells grown under normal gravity and microgravity conditions at the 4, 8, and 24 h time points, respectively (Supplemental FileS2). Likewise, 21, 21, and 23 statistically significant differences were observed between the corresponding culture supernatant samples at these time points (Supplemental FileS3). Keeping in mind the caveat that the number of significant differences at each time point were close to that expected by random chance alone (5% error rate), the significant changes of cell-associated and supernatant metabolites of the 8 h HARV cultures are summarized in Table1, and their potential relationship to the corresponding 8 h RNA-seq data are discussed below. Principle component analysis (PCA) of cellular (a) and supernatant (b) metabolites. Values onXandYaxis labels = % of the total eigen values List of cellular and supernatant metabolites that displayed a significant (p< 0.05) time/growth condition interaction att= 8 h HARV growth Because macroscopic structural differences between theS. mutanssimulated microgravity and normal gravity HARV cultures were consistently observed at 8 h growth (early stationary phase), we chose to perform RNA-seq analysis onn= 3 independent biological samples per growth condition (simulated microgravity and normal gravity) isolated from this time point. Compared to the metabolomics data, differential expression analysis of the 8 h RNA-seq data revealed a large number of statistically significant gene expression changes in normal gravity relative to simulated microgravity growth (Supplemental FileS4). Specifically, 94 genes were up-regulated (log2fold-change ≥1.0) and 153 genes were down-regulated (log2fold-change ≤−1.0) in normal gravity cultures relative to simulated microgravity cultures. These patterns in gene expression were confirmed by qPCR for a subset of genes (Supplemental TableS1). Functional classification (Fig.4) revealed that expression of a large number of genes associated with transposon sequences, as well as several genes encoding predicted phage proteins, were down-regulated in normal gravity cultures relative to simulated microgravity growth. A second trend of interest was the significant down-regulated expression of genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, including various phosphotransferase (PTS) systems, the carbon catabolite protein regulatorccpA, and the redox sensitive transcriptional regulatorrex, in the 8 h normal gravity cultures relative to the simulated microgravity cultures (Fig.4and Supplemental FileS4). Increased expression of genes encoding ribosomal proteins, tRNAs and other aspects of protein translation was also observed in the normal gravity cultures compared to simulated microgravity growth, whereas expression of a large number of genes encoding transcriptional regulators was decreased in the normal gravity cultures (Fig.4). As well, altered expression of stress genes was also observed in the normal gravity HARV cultures, including decreased expression of the toxin–antitoxin (TA) systemsmazEF(SMU_172/173) andrelBE(SMU_895/896), decreased expression of the holin-likelrgA, decreased expression of the peroxide resistance genedpr, and increased expression of genes encoding glutathione S-transferase (SMU_1296) and glutaredoxin (SMU_669c) (Fig.4). DAVID bioinformatics resource22,23was used to further probe the RNA-seq dataset for functional annotation groups that were enriched in the genes that displayed a log2fold change expression of at least ±1.0 in the normal gravity vs. simulated microgravity HARV cultures (Supplemental TableS2). This analysis revealed the presence of four significant (enrichment scores ≥1.3) functional annotation clusters in the down-regulated normal gravity genes, which included genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism and transport (cluster I), transcriptional regulators (clusters II and III), and carbohydrate transporters/other membrane proteins (cluster IV). As well, functional annotation clusters involved in arginine metabolism (cluster V) and nucleoside/tRNA metabolism (cluster VI) were significantly enriched (enrichment scores ≥1.3) in the up-regulated normal gravity genes. To identify metabolic pathways potentially altered under the simulated microgravity growth condition, all statistically-significant changes in 8 h growth gene expression from the RNA-seq differential expression analysis with a minimum log2fold-change of at least ±0.6 were also analyzed using the bioinformatics program Metacyc.24. The top metabolic pathways identified by this analysis were mixed acid fermentation (seven genes), arginine biosynthesis (six genes), and pyrimidine deoxyribonucleotide biosynthesis (five genes) (Supplemental Fig.S3). Specifically, genes involved in the conversion of acetyl-CoA to 2-oxoglutarate (a TCA cycle intermediate), arginine biosynthesis, and dCDP/dTMP biosynthesis were upregulated in the normal gravity HARV cultures, whereas genes involved in ethanol and acetate fermentation were down-regulated in normal gravity HARV cultures. Interestingly, when comparing these metabolic pathways to statistically-significant changes in cellular metabolites at 8 h growth (Table1), several matched to the corresponding metabolic pathway changes (Supplemental Fig.S3) identified in the RNA-seq data by Metacyc, including 2-oxogluarate (alpha-ketoglutarate; mixed acid fermentation), pyruvate (mixed acid fermentation), argininosuccinate (arginine biosynthesis), uridine monophosphate and uracil (pyrmidine deoxynucleotide de novo biosynthesis). The apparent increased sensitivity of the RNA-seq data in detecting more changes inS. mutansmetabolism relative to the corresponding metabolomics data may reflect a suboptimal component of the metabolomics sample collection method and/or processing time. Assessment of oxidative stress and competence phenotypes S. mutansencounters significant oxidative stress in the oral cavity in the form of H2O2production by competing non-cariogenic oral streptococci,25,26as well as from dental care products (toothpastes, mouthwash) that contain H2O2. Furthermore, expression of several oxidative stress-related genes (dpr,rex,SMU_1296, SMU_669c) was altered in the 8 h simulated microgravity HARV cultures. Therefore, the ability ofS. mutansto survive exogenous H2O2treatment was compared in cells isolated from exponential (t= 4), early-stationary (t= 8) and late stationary (t= 16) simulated microgravity and normal gravity HARV cultures (Fig.5). Although no significant differences in oxidative stress resistance were observed between normal gravity and simulated microgravity cells isolated from 4 and 8 h growth, the H2O2-treated 4 h cells (Fig.5a) displayed a greater overall loss of viability (~1% survival after 90 min of treatment) compared to the 8 h cells (Fig.5b; ~50% survival after 90 min of treatment). Interestingly, when this experiment was repeated on cells from normal gravity and simulated microgravity cultures harvested at 16 h growth (Fig.5c), the simulated microgravity cells displayed significantly (P< 0.05, one-tailedTtest) increased H2O2killing (~22% survival after 60 min treatment) compared to the normal gravity cells (~43% survival after 60 min treatment). Percent survival ofS. mutanspost-treatment with 5 mM H2O2. Cells fromt= 4 (a),t= 8 (b), ort= 16 (c) hour simulated microgravity (triangles) and normal gravity (circles) HARV cultures (n= 3 independent experiments per time point per growth condition) were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in sterile HBSS. Samples were withdrawn to determine initial CFU/ml (“t= 0”), and then H2O2was added to a final concentration of 5 mM. CFU/ml of each cell suspension was sampled at 20, 40, 60, 90, and 120 min post-H2O2addition, and CFU/ml were determined. % Survival was calculated by 100 × [(t= final CFU/ml)/(t= 0 CFU/ml)].Error bars= SEM.Asteriskdenotes statistical significance, one-tailedttest (p< 0.05) Because previousS. mutansstudies have implicated a complex link between oxidative stress, biofilm formation, and natural competence [reviewed in27], we were curious if competence was also subject to regulation by the low-shear modeled microgravity ﻿(LSMMG) environment. Therefore early-exponential phase (growth phase at whichS. mutansis most competent during standard in vitro growth) simulated microgravity and normal gravity HARV cultures were tested for their ability to uptake plasmid DNA. However, transformation efficiency (as measured by uptake of a plasmid conferring erythromycin resistance) was nearly identical between simulated microgravity and normal gravity HARV cultures (Fig.6). The transformation efficiency was also not affected by HARV growth itself, as the HARV transformation efficiencies were similar to those measured in a parallel non-rotating culture ofS. mutans(Fig.6). S. mutanscompetence phenotype assessed in simulated microgravity and normal gravity HARV cultures. Simulated microgravity and normal gravity HARV cultures, as well as a parallel static Falcon tube control culture, were each grown for 1.5 h in biofilm media prior to addition of 2 µg pOri23 plasmid DNA. All three cultures were then grown for 2.5 more hours followed by harvest and serial dilution plating on BHI agar ± 10 µg/ml erythromycin (selective antibiotic to monitor plasmid transformation). Transformation efficiency was calculated as the percentage of transformants (CFU/ml on BHI + erythromycin) among total viable cells (CFU/ml on BHI).Datarepresent the average ofn= 3 independent experiments.Error bars= SEM 3.S. mutansdisplays an altered cell aggregation phenotype under simulated microgravity conditions: Micro-organisms such asMicrococcus luteus,57E. coli,58P. aeruginosa,34,35,59S. aureus,29S. typhimurium,36andCandida albicans60,61have all displayed increased biofilm growth when grown in either ground-based simulated and/or space flight microgravity conditions. In some instances, this biofilm increase was paralleled by documented increases in expression of biofilm-promoting regulatory genes or adhesion factors.29,34–36,49,58,61Given these observations in other micro-organisms, we predicted thatS. mutanswould also display an increase in biofilm formation when grown in HARV microgravity cultures. Although biofilms attached to a solid surface were not assessed in these studies, macroscopic differences in cell–cell aggregation were typically observed in simulated microgravity compared to normal gravity HARV cultures at stationary phase (8 h growth; Fig.2), suggesting that cell–cell adhesion and/or biofilm-like properties of this bacterium were altered in response to simulated microgravity growth. Although cell aggregation was observed in both the normal gravity and simulated microgravity HARV cultures grown in biofilm-promoting media containing sucrose, the simulated microgravity cell aggregates were more compact and more difficult to disrupt relative to the aggregates formed during normal gravity growth. Follow-up studies will be required to better characterize the structural properties of these cell aggregates (i.e. production of sucrose-dependent exopolysaccharide) and whether they are actually similar to biofilms that form on hydroxyapatite in vitro and/or the tooth surface in vivo. However, it is noteworthy that altered cell aggregation and/or “attachment-independent” phenotypes have also been observed in other biofilm-forming microbes in both LSMMG29,34and during spaceflight.61 Bacterial strain and growth conditions S. mutansUA15962was used for all of the experiments described below. AllS. mutanscultures (including HARV vessels) were grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO2incubator. For each experiment,S. mutanswas freshly streaked from a frozen 30% (vol vol−1) glycerol stock onto Brain heart infusion (BHI) agar and grown for 48 h. A single colony was then inoculated into 30 ml BHI broth, and grown as a static culture for 16–18 h prior to inoculation of HARVs. Disposable vessel rotary cell culture systems (Synthecon) with vertical and horizontal 4-station rotator bases were used to simulate microgravity (HARV rotated on axis perpendicular to gravitational vector) and “normal” (1 × g) gravity (HARV rotated on axis parallel to gravitational vector), respectively (Supplemental FigureS4). All HARV manipulations were performed under a Class II A2 biosafety cabinet (Labconco). HARV vessels were filled with sterile media according to manufacturer’s recommendations, and incubated at room temperature for 18 h prior to each experiment. This media was then aseptically removed, and 20× diluteS. mutansovernight culture (approximate OD600= 0.06/ml) in room-temperature semi-defined biofilm media (BM)43containing 11 mM glucose and 10 mM sucrose, was used to fill each HARV. Prior to HARV rotation and incubation, sterile 5-ml luer lock syringes were used to remove air bubbles according to manufacturer’s protocols. For each experiment (n= 3 independent experiments per growth condition), overnightS. mutanscultures were used to inoculate 120 ml of sterile BM containing 11 mM glucose and 10 mM sucrose. This inoculum was mixed well by vigorous swirling and vortexing, and 1 ml withdrawn to measure the time-of-inoculation (t= 0) CFU/ml. The remaining inoculum volume was then subjected again to vigorous swirling and vortexing and immediately used to fill 2 × 50 ml disposable HARVs as described above. Each HARV was rotated either vertically (“simulated microgravity”) or horizontally (“normal gravity”) at 37 °C, 5% CO2for 24 h. HARVs were rotated at 30 RPM for the first 8 h of growth, and the rotation speed of each reactor was increased to 32 RPM after 8 h of growth to ensure thatS. mutanscell aggregates did not settle to the bottom of the simulated microgravity HARV. At 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 h postinoculation, each HARV was removed from the incubator, vigorously agitated to remove adherent cell clumps from the walls and membrane of the HARV reactor and evenly dispersing cell clumps, and 1 ml culture was immediately removed for CFU/ml assessment. The same volume of sterile media was then added back to each HARV and air bubbles removed as described above prior to re-initiation of simulated microgravity or normal gravity HARV growth. For CFU/ml quantification, each 1 ml sample was vortexed vigorously for at least 30 s to resuspend cell clumps, followed immediately by serial dilution (each tube vortexed vigorously for at least 15 s between each dilution) and CFU/ml determination using the track plating method.63 HARV “end-point” growth curves OvernightS. mutanscultures were used to inoculate 500 ml sterile BM containing 11 mM glucose and 10 mM sucrose to an approximate OD600= 0.06/ml as described above. This inoculum was mixed well by vigorous swirling and vortexing, and 1 ml was withdrawn to measure thet= 0 OD600, pH, and CFU/ml. The remaining inoculum volume was then immediately used to fill 8 × 50 ml disposable HARVs (inoculum volume was subjected to vigorous swirling and vortexing before addition to each HARV). For end-point growth curve analysis att= 4, 6, 8, and 12 h (n= 2 independent experiments total per time point per growth condition), four simulated microgravity and four normal gravity HARV cultures were grown in parallel at 37 °C, 5% CO2. HARVs were rotated at 30 RPM for the first 8 h of growth, and the rotation speed of each reactor was increased to 32 RPM after 8 h of growth to ensure thatS. mutanscell aggregates did not settle to the bottom of the simulated microgravity cultures. At each time point, one simulated microgravity and one normal gravity HARV were each harvested as follows: 25 ml of HARV culture was transferred to a sterile 50 ml Falcon tube. The HARV was then closed and shaken vigorously for approximately 5 s (until there were no remaining visible clumps of bacteria stuck to the inside walls and membrane of the HARV). The reactor was then immediately uncapped and the remaining culture transferred to the 50 ml Falcon tube, which was vortexed at high speed for 30 s prior to removing 100 µl for CFU counts. The tube was vortexed again for 10 s, and 900 µl immediately removed for measuring OD600and pH readings. OD600readings were obtained using a Genesys 10 Bio spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific), culture pH measured with colorpHast indicator strips (EMD), and CFU/ml calculated by serial dilution plating as described above. For the end-point growth curve analysis att= 24 andt= 48 h, a separate experiment (n= 2 biological replicates for each time point) was performed as described above. HARV end-point growth for metabolomic and RNA-seq analyses OvernightS. mutanscultures were used to inoculate 350 ml sterile BM containing 11 mM glucose and 10 mM sucrose to an approximate OD600= 0.06/ml as described above. This inoculum was mixed well by vigorous swirling and vortexing, and 1 ml was withdrawn to measure thet= 0 OD600, pH, and CFU/ml. The remaining inoculum volume was then immediately used to fill 6 × 50 ml disposable HARVs (inoculum volume was subjected to vigorous swirling and vortexing before addition to each HARV). A sterile media control was also collected at the beginning of each experiment and stored at −80 °C for metabolomics analysis (see below). For each experiment (n= 3 independent experiments total), three simulated microgravity and three normal gravity HARV cultures were grown in parallel at 37 °C, 5% CO2as described above for the end-point growth curve analysis. For each experiment, one simulated microgravity and one normal gravity HARV were each harvested att= 4,t= 8 h, andt= 24 h growth, as described above for the end-point growth curve analysis (for a total ofn= 3 independent samples per time point per growth condition). HARVs were photographed prior to culture disruption and harvest to document macroscopic growth observations. After harvesting, 34 ml of eacht= 4, 8, and 24 h HARV culture was centrifuged at 3000 RPM, 4 °C for 20 min and immediately placed on ice. 1 ml of culture supernatant was removed from each centrifuged sample, transferred to 1.5 ml tubes, and immediately frozen at −80 °C. The remaining culture supernatants were decanted and cell pellets immediately frozen at −80 °C. For RNA-seq samples (t= 8 h only), a 10-ml aliquot of each HARV culture was also centrifuged at 3000 RPM, 4 °C for 20 min and immediately placed on ice. Culture supernatants were decanted and 1 ml RNAlater (Ambion) was added to each cell pellet prior to immediate storage at −80 °C. Metabolite extraction and metabolomics analysis RNA isolation and RNA-seq analysis Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) assay For each experiment (n= 3 independent biological samples each for simulated microgravity and normal gravity HARV cultures), twoS. mutans10-ml HARV cultures were inoculated as described above, and each was grown for either 4, 8, or 16 h. For the 4 and 8 h experiments, the HARV rotation speed was 30 RPM. For the 16 h experiment, the HARV rotation speed was 30 RPM for the first 8 h of growth, and was then increased to 35 RPM to counteract sedimentation of cellular aggregates.S. mutanscultures were then harvested from each HARV vessel, transferred to a 50 ml Falcon tube, and centrifuged for 10 min at 4000 RPM. Cell pellets were resuspended in 5 ml sterile 1× Hanks Buffered Salt Solution (HBSS), and 100 µl was withdrawn from each tube and subjected to serial dilution plating as described above to enumerate CFU/ml of each cell suspension at “t= 0” (prior to H2O2addition). H2O2was added to each remaining 4.9 ml cell suspension to a final concentration of 5 mM, and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Samples of each cell suspension were removed at 15, 30, 45, 60, and 120 min post-H2O2addition to enumerate CFU/ml, and % survival for each sample was calculated by 100× (t= × CFU/ml/t= 0 CFU/ml). The DAVID Bioinformatics Resource22,23was used to aid in functional categorization of the RNA-seq differential expression data and to perform functional annotation clustering. Only genes with statistically-significant log2-fold changes of at least ±1.0 were included in these analyses. The lowest classification stringency was used for functional categorization. For functional annotation clustering analysis, the default analysis parameters were used: Medium classification stringency, similarity threshold = 0.5, enrichment threshold (EASE score) = 1.0. As recommended previously,22an enrichment score cutoff of ≥1.3 was applied to the functional annotation clustering analysis. For identifying trends in metabolic pathway changes, all statistically-significant RNA-seq differential expression data with a log2-fold change of at least ±0.6 were also analyzed using Metacyc.24 For metabolomics, statistical analyses were performed in ArrayStudio on log transformed data. For those analyses not standard in ArrayStudio, the programs R (http://cran.r-project.org/) or JMP (SAS,http://www.jmp.com) were used as previously described.72Two-way ANOVA was used to compare the effects of treatment (simulated microgravity vs. normal gravity growth) and growth time (t= 4, 8, and 24 h) on metabolite differences. Multiple comparisons were accounted for with the false discovery rate (FDR) method, and each FDR was estimated byq-values. PCA was also applied to the metabolomics data. For RNA-seq, differential expression analysis was performed by Seqwright Genomic Services using FPKM (fragments per kilobase per million mapped reads) values and fold-change was expressed as log2(FPKM normal gravity/FPKM simulated microgravity). For all other data, statistical analyses were performed using Sigmaplot version 12.5 (Build 12.5.0.38, Systat Software, Inc.). Data was tested for normality and equal variance, followed by aT-test or Rank-sum test, as appropriate.
