The microbiome of the built environment comprises bacterial, archaeal, fungal, and viral communities associated with human-made structures. Even though most of these microbes are benign, antibiotic-resistant pathogens can colonize and emerge indoors, creating infection risk through surface transmission or inhalation. Several studies have catalogued the microbial composition and ecology in different built environment types. These have informedin vitrostudies that seek to replicate the physicochemical features that promote pathogenic survival and transmission, ultimately facilitating the development and validation of intervention techniques used to reduce pathogen accumulation. Such interventions include usingBacillus-based cleaning products on surfaces or integrating bacilli into printable materials. Though this work is in its infancy, early research suggests the potential to use microbial biocontrol to reduce hospital- and home-acquired multidrug-resistant infections. Although these techniques hold promise, there is an urgent need to better understand the microbial ecology of built environments and to determine how these biocontrol solutions alter species interactions. This review covers our current understanding of microbial ecology of the built environment and proposes strategies to translate that knowledge into effective biocontrol of antibiotic-resistant pathogens. To reduce the risks associated with various disinfection cleaning agents, hospitals now more frequently use a variety of cleaning strategies for disinfection, including advanced technologies like exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light and hydrogen peroxide vapour [8]. Despite these powerful treatments, outbreaks ofClostridioides difficile[9] and other antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) organisms [10-14] have continued to rise within healthcare settings, highlighting the enduring challenge of simultaneously disinfecting an area while avoiding selection for traits that increase pathogenic potential. Reducing the spread of AMR pathogens is a crucial priority for global human health. In 2019, 1.27 million deaths were directly caused by AMR pathogens globally [15], and they are projected to cause an additional 10 million deaths annually by 2050 [16]. We must therefore bolster our defences against persistent and emerging pathogens, safeguarding global health and well-being amidst the evolving landscape of microbial threats [17]. Investigations in real-world built spaces have led to numerous new hypotheses regarding microbial survival and transmission, and the metabolic interactions that underpin these properties. Robustly testing these hypotheses has required innovations in experimental laboratory-based studies. Despite laboratories being built spaces themselves, recreating the inherent ecological dynamics that define the indoor microbiome has proven difficult and has required a reimagining of traditional microbiology techniques. Microbes in the built environment are generally assumed to be starving, dying, or dead [41]. We are, therefore, attempting to study life on the edge of survival. Many microorganisms are unable to survive on surfaces, but some pathogens have demonstrated the ability to survive on surfaces common to the built environment. For example, MRSA shows robust viability on surfaces such as vinyl and plastic over days [42]. Traditional microbiology cultivates microbes using media optimized over decades of experimentation to encourage their growth. Such conditions are unlikely to replicate microbial interactions in the built environment. So, it is necessary to use techniques that more closely reproduce the harsh conditions of most built environment surfaces to more accurately examine how microbes survive, grow, and interact in this environment. Observational studies and laboratory investigations inform intervention studies in ways that help determine the potential benefit of removing species of concern or introducing potentially beneficial microbes, both for the integrity of the building structure and the health of the occupants. Intervention studies have been performed in mock built environment microcosms, as well as in full-scale field trials, and are now elucidating the ecological dynamics of these environments. Unfortunately, due to the cost and added risk of conducting an intervention within buildings such as hospitals, only a few full-scale tests of these intervention techniques have been completed. This review will discuss recent advances in built environment microbiome research, with a focus on strategies related to the understanding and translation of biocontrol practices used to reduce antibiotic-resistant pathogens on surfaces in real-world clinical settings. Techniques for investigating the microbiome of the built environment Modelling microbial metabolism To improve our understanding of microbial activity and ecology in these extreme environments, it is necessary to fundamentally understand their metabolic potential. Genome-scale metabolic models (GSMMs) are mathematical models of metabolic networks reconstructed from the organism’s annotated genome [63,64]. Genome-scale metabolic modelling can help facilitate a clear understanding of the mechanisms that microbes deploy to survive, germinate, and compete for resources. These models predict growth rates in a simulated medium and determine what reaction rates are needed to support growth. Pairs or larger groups of models can be connected to determine which metabolites are being readily exchanged (commensally or symbiotically) and which limited nutrients drive competition between the organisms [65,66]. These models can make predictions for hundreds of conditions within seconds, allowing for the rapid identification of important nutrients, uptakes, and secretions, thereby rationally informing the design of subsequent experiments. In an iterative process, experimental data can be incorporated into GSMMs, contextualizing the data and further refining their predictions. Transcriptomics can also be used to detect reactions associated with low-transcription genes, increasing the specificity of the model to the environment of interest [67]. The refined model then yields insights into the biological relevance of transcriptional changes by identifying how they affect the expression of larger metabolic pathways. These models can also facilitate the analysis of multiomics data, by integrating them into an interpretable scaffold, which can then be used to predict how changes in the genome or to the environment influence survival or competitive outcomes. Using these modelling techniques on samples from the International Space Station, an extreme built environment revealed beneficial interactions between the pathogenKlebsiella pneumoniaeand bacterial species of the genusPantoeaand the familyEnterobacteriaceae[68]. The model also predictedK. pneumoniaeis parasitic towards the fungal genusAspergillus, which was confirmed experimentally via co-culture [68]. Predicting microbial interactions in built environments via modelling is a powerful technique to inform efficacious biocontrol strategies by identifying novel species interactions and predicting their differential effect in a range of scenarios. This information can be generated based solely on ‘omics data and subsequently confirmed in laboratory studies. Interpreting metabolic ecology Semi-in vitroinvestigations are effective at discovering novel microbial interactions, but ecological dynamics can also be inferred from applying multiomic techniques to controlled building environments. For example, one study characterized the chemical and microbial compositions of two frequently wet surfaces in a residential setting, specifically the kitchen sink and bathroom shower [73]. This study used a combination of culture-dependent and independent techniques, including transcriptional analysis of the 16S rRNA gene to determine which bacteria were active at the time of sampling, and assessment of both volatile and soluble chemicals to explore the links between the observed microbiota and chemical exudates. This study showed that microbes play a critical role in structuring the chemical profiles of surfaces in built environments, particularly in kitchen sinks and shower stalls. The microbial volatile organic compounds (mVOCs) were predominantly associated with fatty acid processing, and the composition of these mVOCs appeared more stable than that of the microbial communities themselves, which showed variations in response to changing environmental conditions. A second example demonstrated microbial colonization, succession, and viability in a tightly controlled restroom environment [61]. This study focused on the ecological succession and viability of human-associated microbiota on restroom surfaces, including floors, toilet seats, and soap dispensers. The study demonstrated that a late-successional microbial community develops on restroom surfaces within 5 to 8 hours of decontamination. This community showed remarkable stability over weeks to months, indicating a quick establishment and persistence of specific microbial assemblages. The authors also showed that faecal taxa, particularly those able to enter a dormant phase, can persist for extended periods on restroom surfaces. This insight into microbial survival strategies in dry and nutrient-poor environments of built environments is crucial for understanding disease transmission, ecology, and environmental health. This study also found a significant positive correlation between bacterial and viral abundances, but with an unexpectedly low virus-to-bacterium ratio of nearly 1:1. This suggests that many bacteria on restroom surfaces are in a dormant state, influencing the dynamics of phages in these environments. Understanding microbial ecological dynamics in these systems is essential if we are able to control the survival, emergence, and persistence of pathogens. Next, we explore how biocontrol may be applied to manipulate these ecosystems to reduce the persistence of pathogens in the built environment. Biocontrol in the built environment In agriculture, biocontrol has been rigorously investigated as a replacement for pesticidal, antimicrobial, and antifungal compounds used to eliminate disease-causing organisms [74,75]. As many plant-associated microbes are naturally antagonistic towards human-associated pathogens [76], the adaptation of this method in built environments has become an emerging area of research. TheBacillusspecies used in probiotic cleaning products are also often associated with plants and soil [77]. Additionally,Priestia megaterium(previouslyBacillus megaterium)is often included in these formulations due to its biocontrol activity in agriculture [78]. SomeBacillusspecies are also part of the healthy human microbiome and can confer health benefits when administered as an oral probiotic. For example, consumingB. subtilisspores can decolonizeS. aureusfrom the human gut [79].Staphylococcus aureusis an opportunistic pathogen and present in approximately one-third of the human population [80-82], suggesting that decolonization can lower the overall risk of developing futureS. aureusinfections, although we also concede that removal of beneficialStaphylococcusspecies and strains may have negative health impacts. Bacillusspecies form spores when starved for nutrients, making them resistant to damage by heat, UV, chemicals, and desiccation. Spores remain in this dormant state until conditions improve and then germinate upon exposure to certain amino acids, such asl-alanine,l-valine, andl-asparagine [83]. This makes them ideal for inclusion in cleaning solutions because unlike probiotics that contains vegetative cells (which must be refrigerated), a spore-containing solution can be stored at room temperature indefinitely. Additionally,Bacillusspores will remain viable on built environment surfaces for at least 72 hours [84], can be incorporated into materials [85] where they can repair microfractures [86], and facilitate changes to a material’s shape in response to changes in humidity [87]. In the future, building materials might contain spores for the purpose of maintaining structural integrity and improving the health of occupants via biocontrol mechanisms and immune stimulation [88,89], although research in this area is still in the very early stages. The germination ofBacillus spores is triggered by either (A)L-alanine/L-valine or (B) a combination ofL-asparagine, glucose, fructose, and potassium ions [107]. VegetativeBacilluscells can generate different compounds that can exclude pathogens, including (C) the siderophore bacillibactin, which binds iron and is involved in competitive exclusion of nearby microbes [108]; (D) surfactin, which has antimicrobial properties and also aids in movement across surfaces [109]; (E) bacillomycin, which has potent antibacterial activity [110]; (F) bacilysin [106]; and (G) fengycin [111], which are both antifungal compounds. Differential use patterns of healthcare facilities might alter best practices for probiotic cleaner use. For example, it is unknown how the magnitude of response might vary between different wards or rooms. Patient rooms and bathrooms have been the primary focus of intervention studies; however, other shared spaces, such as hallways or visitor areas, also carry the potential for pathogen accumulation and transmission risk. Additionally, long-term monitoring is crucial to detect whether the pathogens in these environments begin to adapt to this new cleaning method and therefore become resistant to biocontrol. Such a situation could start an evolutionary “arms race” with unknown outcomes. It is crucial to consider the health and emotional impacts on the patients and staff. Sociological studies on healthcare workers and patients are necessary to understand the perception that patients, staff, and the public have about the use of these novel products and to involve their feedback in product design and application. The popularity of probiotics in popular foods and drinks could help alleviate concerns, but deploying them in hospitals, especially around high-risk patients, will likely be controversial. Understanding the perception of these products, and explaining how and why they work, will aid in successful widespread adoption across healthcare systems. As seen in studies conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, harsh cleaning treatments using bleach may inhibit the probiotic and phage cleaners, so it will be imperative that staff are trained in how to properly treat surfaces cleaned with probiotics. Beyond direct application to the engineering of probiotic materials [85], 3D printing is primed to be the future of microbial biocontrol in built environments. Recent advances in 3D printing have resulted in materials that can be printed at low enough temperatures that spores and even live bacteria are not harmed during the assembly process. Unlike previous efforts, which used hydrogels [85], these new approaches can enable the printing of ceramics or hard plastics with improved utility as building materials. Using genome-enabled metabolic modelling to select bacteria that are optimized for these printing processes presents unique opportunities for built environment-specific designs that could be used to manipulate the ecology of these environments in prescribed ways. If this trend continues, we may soon be able to print tiles, furniture, or even entire structures out of sustainably produced microbially active materials [97]. Establishing the efficacy of these products through well-designed field intervention studies that are informed by lab-based experiments is an exciting subfield of built environment microbiome research and will ultimately lead to better products, building materials, and design techniques in buildings to improve occupant health and well-being.
