Enterococcus faecalisis a multidrug resistant, opportunistic human pathogen and a leading cause of hospital acquired infections. Recently, isolates have been recovered from the air and surfaces onboard the International Space Station (ISS). Pangenomic and functional analyses were carried out to assess their potential impact on astronaut health. Genomes of each ISS isolate, and both clinical and commensal reference strains, were evaluated for their core and unique gene content, acquired antibiotic resistance genes, phage, plasmid content, and virulence traits. In order to determine their potential survival when outside of the human host, isolates were also challenged with three weeks of desiccation at 30% relative humidity. Finally, pathogenicity of the ISS strains was evaluated in the model organismCaenorhabditis elegans.At the culmination of this study, there were no defining signatures that separated known pathogenic strains from the more commensal phenotypes using the currently available resources. As a result, the current reliance on database information alone must be shifted to experimentally evaluated genotypic and phenotypic characteristics of clinically relevant microorganisms. Enterococcus faecalisrepresent a core, yet quantitatively minor portion of the human gut microbiome (Schloissnig et al., 2013) that are well suited to persist outside of the host environment. Evidence recently emerged that the enterococci may have split from their last common ancestor at approximately the time animal life began to colonize terrestrial habitats (∼425 million years ago), and traits that promote survival and transmission in the exposed land environment selected for the characteristic ruggedness of the genus (Lebreton et al., 2017). Supporting that proposition, enterococci display significantly higher levels of resistance to a variety of antiseptics, salts, organic compounds, desiccation, and starvation than ancestral outgroups (Lebreton et al., 2017). Because traits contributing to environmental persistence also contribute to persistence in the hospital environment, enterococci rank among leading causes of healthcare associated infections (Weiner et al., 2016). While certain strains ofE. faecalisare pathogenic for hospitalized patients,e.g., MMH594 (Huycke et al., 1991) and V583 (Sahm et al., 1989), and possess genomes swollen to 3.3 Mb by the accretion of mobile genetic elements (MGEs), the genomes of commensal isolates are 25% smaller, as typified by the strain OG1RF (Bourgogne et al., 2008). In the antibiotic era, loss of CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) protection of the chromosome further facilitated the accumulation of additional antibiotic resistance by enterococci (Fiore et al., 2019). Several other MGEs have been directly linked to virulence factors (Shankar et al., 2002), however, the selective value of most mobile elements in clinical isolates of enterococci remains to be determined. In addition to characterizing the microbiome of the ISS, understanding the effects of spaceflight on bacterial physiology will be imperative for assessing the impacts on crew health. WhenPseudomonas aeruginosawas exposed to spaceflight, there was an increase in the total cell viable numbers, biomass, biofilm thickness, and the cells produced a unique biofilm architecture not seen in ground controls of the species (Mclean et al., 2001;Kim et al., 2013).Su et al. (2014)documented growth curve, transcriptomic, and proteomic alterations (related to amino acid transport, metabolism, energy production, and conversion) inBacillus cereusandSerratia marcescensduring spaceflight (Wang et al., 2014). Carbon utilization profiles were altered amongS. marcescensclones after flight, and transcriptomic and proteomic data revealed significant changes in metabolic functions (Wang et al., 2014). Additionally,Wilson et al. (2007)utilized proteomic analysis and expression profiles to demonstrate that changes in genomic regulation ofSalmonella typhymuriumwere widely distributed, and virulence was increased in response to spaceflight. AlthoughHammond et al. (2013)report a significant decrease inE. faecalisOG1RF virulence when grown under spaceflight conditions, this was inferred by a reduction in the optical density of cultures grown in the presence of adultCaenorhabditis elegansrather than worm viability. In addition to altered microbial physiological responses, astronaut health is also impacted by the spaceflight environment. Factors such as microgravity, physiological stress, isolation, abnormal circadian rhythms, and altered nutrition have been shown to weaken an astronaut’s immunity in as little as 10 to 15 days (Crucian et al., 2013), and these effects can persist up to 6 months post mission ISS (Crucian et al., 2015). This weakened immunity, combined with the prevalence ofE. faecalisstrains, or other potential pathogens including viruses (Rooney et al., 2019), could result in severe human health consequences on board the ISS, even in incidences of routine medicinal procedures (i.e., the introduction of a percutaneous catheterMermel, 2012). Strains and Culture Conditions Isolate recovery locations on the International Space Station. Isolates (denoted 1-4) were recovered from the United States Lab and Node 3. Toilets (T) are located in Zvezda (Service Module) and Tranquility (Node 3). Summary of genomic characterization of ISS and control strains ofEnterococcus faecalis. ** Single nucleotide variant of the nearest ST. Genome Sequencing of ISS Strains Pangenomic and Phylogenetic Analysis Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was performed by evaluating sevenE. faecalisgenes (aroE,gdh,gki,gyd,pstS,xpt, andyqiL) and sequence types (STs) assigned based on the alleles present in each genome (Larsen et al., 2012). The potential presence of plasmids was assessed using PlasmidFinder (Carattoli et al., 2014). VirFinder was used to detect potentialE. faecalisvirulence factor genes (Joensen et al., 2014), and PathogenFinder provided a predictive score for each strain’s potential pathogenicity for humans (Cosentino et al., 2013). Additionally, the web server PHAge Search Tool – Enhanced Release (PHASTER) was used to detect the presence of phage sequences within bacterial genomic data (Arndt et al., 2016), and the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD) was used to identify genes potentially associated with antimicrobial resistance (Jia et al., 2016). The presence of CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) arrays and Cas (CRISPR associated proteins) was detected using the online tool, CRISPRCasFinder (Couvin et al., 2018). Capsule type polymorphisms were determined as described byMcBride et al. (2007). Briefly the presence, or absence, of genes in the locus (EF2485 to EF2495) were verified in the genomes of each isolate. CPS type 1 strains are defined as isolates withcpsAandB, andhcp1(EF2484), while CPS type 2 strains consist of the fullcpslocus andhcp1(EF2484 to EF2495). CPS type 5 strains are similar to the type 2 gene profile, but do not containcpsF(EF0090). Minimum Inhibitory Concentration of Antibiotics Antibiotic MIC was determined by broth microdilution as described (CLSI, 2017). Briefly, overnight cultures of isolates were diluted and 104cells in MH broth were inoculated into each well of 96 well plates containing serial 2-fold dilutions of antibiotics. Maximum concentration tested: penicillin (10 μg mL–1), amoxicillin (10 μg mL–1), ampicillin (10 μg mL–1), oxacillin (256 μg mL–1), erythromycin (50 μg mL–1), and tetracycline (64 μg mL–1). This procedure was repeated in BHI (McBride et al., 2007), and isolates were additionally evaluated for high level aminoglycoside resistance (HLGR) with: gentamicin, streptomycin, and kanamycin (each at a maximum concentration of 2 mg mL–1). Plates were incubated at 37°C and growth was monitored at 24 and 48 h. Wells containing the lowest antibiotic concentration lacking growth after 48 h were designated the MIC for the respective antibiotics. Survival to desiccation was assessed as previously described (Lebreton et al., 2017;Bryan et al., 2019) with the following modifications.E. faecalisisolates were harvested from stationary phase by centrifugation, and washed twice with sterile (autoclaved, 0.22 μm filtered) water (sH2O). Prior to desiccation, the concentrated cells were resuspended in CDM, and a 10 μL sample was track diluted (Jett et al., 1997) onto M9 medium (M9; Amresco®, cat. no.: J863-500G) amended with 0.1% glucose agar, and incubated at 37°C. After ∼24 h, the number of CFUs recovered from 10 μL track dilutions prepared according toJett et al. (1997)were used to determine the original concentration of cells mL–1(t= −1). Aliquots of cell suspensions (50 μL) were spotted onto autoclaved coverslips, and placed into the desiccation chamber containing Drierite®(≥ 98% CaSO4, W. A. Hammond Drierite Company, Ltd., cat. no.: 778-18-9) until the liquid evaporated (t=0, 24 h). The relative humidity (RH) in the chamber was monitored using a digital hygrometer, and maintained between 30-40% by adding additional Drierite®. Three replicates were prepared for each isolate at each timepoint. The dried cells were removed from the coverslips by rinsing and resuspending the material with a pipet into 1 mL of sH2O. To ensure the samples were homogenously resuspended, rehydrated cells were incubated at 37°C for 1 h while shaking (225 RPM), and vortexed for 15 minutes. The cells were then serially diluted into sH2O and 10 μL track dilutions were plated onto M9 agar. At thet= 0 time point, the number of CFUs recovered from the substrate was designated as the starting population size that survived the initial drying on the coverslip (N0). Subsequent samples were removed from the desiccation chamber every three days and rehydrated as described above to determine the number of surviving CFUs over time (N). The surviving fraction of cells was determined from the ratio ofN/N0. Each time point was evaluated whenNwas ≥ 30 CFU. Pathogenicity ofE. faecalisisolates in aC. elegansmodel Nematode killing assays were performed as previously described (Yuen and Ausubel, 2018). Briefly,C. elegans fer-15;fem-1(CF512) worms were grown on NGM inoculated withE. colistrain OP50 and incubated at 15°C until they reached the L4 stage. Approximately 30–40 of the L4 stage worms were then transferred to BHI agar plates (amended with kanamycin, 10 μg mL–1) inoculated with 100 μL aliquots of each log phaseE. faecalisisolate. The plates were incubated at 25°C and worms were examined for viability. Worms that did not exhibit movement nor respond to physical touch were scored as dead and removed from the plate. Moving worms were scored as alive and also counted. Statistical analyses for the desiccation experiments were performed using JMP®Pro v.14.3 (JMP®, 2019). Prior to evaluating the data for significant differences, the data were assessed for equal variances. Subsequent one-way ANOVAs were performed to determine the significant differences of desiccation survival at different timepoints and among individual isolates.Post hoccomparisons for time were performed using parametric comparisons with a control using Dunnett’s method (N= 18 for each isolate, with the exception oft= 12 d whereN= 17). The meanN/N0for each isolate att= 21 d was evaluated using the non-parametric comparison with a control performed following the Steel method (N= 3 for each isolate). Individual comparisons for survival at two timepoints were performed using a homoscedastic Student’st-test. Analysis of the survival ofCaenorhabditis elegansinfected with the ISS and control strains ofEnterococcus faecalis. The data are reported as the restricted mean (± SE) of three replicates, with the exception of ISS_1 (N= 2 at t = 9d). * Starting number of worms. ** Pairwise analysis of each Kaplan-Meier survival curve using the log-rank test (Han et al., 2016). Those that were not significantly different from each other are indicated with a capital letter, with A being the least pathogenic (p> 0.05). Isolates Recovered From the ISS Following the designations ofMcBride et al. (2007), the capsule type for each ISS strain was determined. All three known capsule type polymorphisms were detected from the ISS strains. ISS_1 contained the fullcpslocus (EF2485 to EF2495) andhcp1(EF2484), and similar to MMH594 and V583, was designated CPS type 2. Isolates ISS_2 and ISS_3 contained thecpslocus andhcp1, but lackedcpsF(EF0090). In agreement with previous analysis of two additional ST30 isolates (McBride et al., 2007), these strains were classified as CPS type 5. The strain ISS_4 contained onlycpsA(EF0095),cpsB(EF0094), andhcp1, and like the other isolates of CC40 and OG1RF, was classified as CPS type 1 (McBride et al., 2007). Assessment of Mobile Elements and Defense Systems The Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD) database identified the tetracycline resistance gene,tetW/N/W, in isolates ISS_2, ISS_3, and ISS_4, which was not present in OG1RF (Jia et al., 2016). The ISStetW/N/Wshared 69.3 (ISS_2 and ISS_3) and 69.1% (ISS_4) sequence homology with the reference sequence (Accession no.:ARO:3004442). The reference gene has been detected in 2.70% of the availableE. faecalisisolates surveyed (Jia et al., 2016). A standard nucleotide BLAST search confirmed thetetW/N/Wgenes present in ISS_2 and ISS_3 shared 100% sequence identity to each other, and differed by three SNPs to thetetW/N/Wgene present in ISS_4 (Altschul et al., 1990). Genome-Based Assessment of the Potential for Pathogenicity The presence, and sequence identity (%), of known virulence factors ofEnterococcus faecalispresent in the ISS and reference genomes (Joensen et al., 2014). * Multiple copies were detected. MMH594 was the only isolate withcylA, one of the genes responsible for the production of cytolysin. Neither OG1RF nor the ISS isolates carried any of the genes in the cytolysin pathway reviewed byCoburn and Gilmore (2003). Minimum Inhibitory Concentration of Antibiotics Minimum inhibitory concentration of antibiotics evaluated in BHI. Desiccation Tolerance ofE. faecalisStrains Desiccation survival ofEnterococcus faecalisstrains from the ISS and the control strains, OG1RF and MMH594. The data are presented as the average (± SD) of triplicate measurements. Some error bars have been obscured by the data points. Pathogenicity of Isolates in aC. elegansModel The average survival ofCaenorhabditis elegansexposed to ISS and control strains ofEnterococcus faecalis. While multiple studies have detected the presence of a wide range of opportunistic human pathogens onboard the ISS, the consensus was that additional data was needed to determine if these microorganisms posed an actual threat to crew health (Schiwon et al., 2013;Be et al., 2017;Lang et al., 2017;Singh et al., 2018a,b;Mora et al., 2019;Sielaff et al., 2019,Sobisch et al., 2019;Urbaniak et al., 2019). Here, we expanded upon previous genomic analyses in an effort to provide a framework for the determination of the pathogenic potential ofE. faecalisisolates. For the comparative analyses, the commensal type strain OG1RF and the clinical isolates, MMH594 and V583, were chosen because of their extensive genotypic (Shankar et al., 2002;Paulsen et al., 2003;McBride et al., 2007;Bourgogne et al., 2008) and phenotypic characterization, specifically in regards toC. eleganspathogenesis (Garsin et al., 2001;Yuen and Ausubel, 2018). In addition, theE. faecalisgenomes of strains 5952 and JH-1 were chosen as representative ST strains of the ISS isolates ISS_2 and ISS_3, and ISS_4, respectively. As members of the core gut microbiome,E. faecaliswill continue to be transported to the ISS and the ability to detect pathogenic strains will be beneficial for crew health. Unlike most environmental bacteria (Staley and Konopka, 1985),E. faecalisstrains are routinely recovered on culture media. Based on the antibiotic resistance profiles presented here, incorporating the above high-level aminoglycosides to the routine onboard culturing activities could serve as the first step toward distinguishing pathogenic from commensal strains ofE. faecalis. Because of their commonness as survivors on abiotic surfaces, their potential ability to infect, as well as the ability ofE. faecalisto readily acquire and spread mobile elements conferring antibiotic resistance, continued microbial monitoring and pathogen identification will be important. Current microbial monitoring of ISS air and surface sampling occurs once a month for the first 90 days of a mission, and decreases to one sample event for every 90 days thereafter (ISS-MORD, 2013). Because these microbial monitoring procedures are culture based, there is an inherent bias toward the small fraction of bacterial species that will form a colony on a plate (Staley and Konopka, 1985). Assessing the total microbial burden, and viable fraction, by combining genomic and culture-based analyses provides a more accurate representation of the ISS microbiome (Be et al., 2017;Mora et al., 2019;Sielaff et al., 2019). However, it is still unclear which, if any, of these microorganisms are relevant to crew health (Schiwon et al., 2013;Be et al., 2017;Lang et al., 2017;Singh et al., 2018a,b;Mora et al., 2019;Sielaff et al., 2019;Sobisch et al., 2019;Urbaniak et al., 2019). The need for expedient identification of pathogenic microorganisms and their antibiotic resistance profiles is not a challenge unique to the spaceflight environment. Recent advances in rapid diagnostics have helped alleviate the clinical reliance on culture based techniques to identify infectious agents, yet these resources are not always widely available (Maurer et al., 2017). Fortunately, this is not the case for the ISS where the crew have access to Wetlab-2 Cepheid© SmartCycyler that can be used for quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis of air, surface, water, and clinical samples3. Although it is currently configured to detect only a limited number of microbial pathogens, the RAZORTMEX BioDetection System (Idaho Technology Inc.) is currently being developed for in-flight microbial monitoring and could be modified for a wider range of microbial targets. Another promising technology for pathogen detection is the ONT MinION sequencing device employed above.Castro-Wallace et al. (2017)have previously validated its efficacy in the spacecraft environment. The MinION is currently capable of identifying bacterial species in near real time from metagenomic data (Sanderson et al., 2018) or isolated samples (Gargis et al., 2019) and has been used for the first ever off-Earth identification of bacteria cultured and sequenced in flight (Burton et al., 2020). Due to the inability for the existing tools to distinguish pathogenic from commensal strains ofE. faecalis, we make the following recommendations: Rather than continuing to wait for sample return and analysis using the current unvalidated databases, we suggest performing an initial screen for HLGR. Then, any isolates exhibiting HLGR should be sequenced using the MinION and evaluated for the presence of the type 2 capsule (McBride et al., 2007), the vancomycin resistance operon observed in V583 (Paulsen et al., 2003), components of the pathogenicity island (e.g., cytolysin production loci and the enterococcal surface protein, Esp), and the absence of functional CRISPR-Cas arrays (Van Tyne et al., 2019). This information would then provide near real-time information for the crew regarding the need for additional decontamination procedures. These advancements would not be limited toE. faecalisisolates, however more accurate genomic targets for additional pathogen detection will need to be experimentally validated (Chiu and Miller, 2019). With the development of such targets, multiple pathogens (including bacteria, fungi, and viruses) can quickly be identified within a single sample (Miller et al., 2019).
