Spaceflight leads to cardiovascular deconditioning in the absence of mitigation strategies. Cardiovascular changes in response to spaceflight are attributed to altered microgravity levels and the ensuing cephalad fluid shift [1]. Overall reductions in physical activity and other factors such as nutritional changes, elevated CO2levels, and a demanding workload also may be contributing factors. Some of the reported cardiovascular changes caused by exposure to the spaceflight environment include reductions in left ventricular mass [2,3], transient atrial distension [4], and hypovolemia [5]. Stagnant or retrograde venous flow as well as thrombosis have been observed in crew during flight [6]. Heart rhythm disturbances postflight also have been reported [7]. Orthostatic intolerance [8] and stiffer carotid arteries [9] have also been observed in crew upon return to Earth. Crew on exploration-class missions (e.g., trip to Mars) will experience prolonged periods of microgravity and exposure to low doses of space radiation given current spacecraft shielding designs. Therefore, it is important to understand the cardiovascular responses to long-duration spaceflight to mitigate potential health risks. The rodent hindlimb unloading (HU) model [10,11] has been used to gain insights into some aspects of human cardiovascular responses to microgravity and cephalad fluid shifts. HU for four weeks in rats resulted in decreased left ventricular mass and volume [12], consistent with findings from a number of bed rest studies [2,13,14,15,16] and from spaceflight [3]. Two weeks of HU in rats perturbs day–night blood pressure (BP) and heart rate regulation [17]. Compared to baseline (pre-HU) values, HU generally led to increased systolic and diastolic BP during both day and night cycles, whereas heart rate was increased during the day but not at night. Some of these HU findings could also have been confounded by other factors such as social isolation and restraint stress [17]. In addition, arrhythmias and aberrant intracellular Ca2+signaling have been observed in mice that underwent HU (26–56 days) [18]. Changes in redox balance have also been reported. For example, hearts from male Sprague–Dawley rats that underwent two weeks of HU displayed increased levels of malondialdehyde, a lipid peroxidation marker [19]. Currently, there is limited information regarding the effects of long-duration spaceflight on the human cardiovascular system at time scales relevant to interplanetary missions (>2 years). In addition, the effects of age, sex, duration of exposure, and long-term recovery on cardiovascular outcomes are not well established. Hence, the goals of our study are to (1) determine the impact of sex, age, duration of exposure, and recovery on oxidative stress responses to microgravity and (2) define underlying molecular mechanisms. We hypothesized that exposure to simulated microgravity and the ensuing recovery would lead to changes in redox balance and the expression of select genes including those that play a role in oxidative stress responses. To test this hypothesis, we examined hearts from male and female rats that underwent hindlimb unloading (HU) for various durations (up to 90 days) and those that underwent reambulation after 90 days of HU. To achieve this, we assessed DNA oxidative damage markers and select transcripts, and performed RNAseq analysis of cardiac tissue. 2.1. Animals and Experiment Design Animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the recommendations of Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, 8th edition. All animal experiments were conducted with prior approval from the UC Davis Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Female and male Long–Evans rats (Taconic) were selected for this study. Animals were group-housed in standard vivarium cages until the onset of HU. A group of females and males (referred to as “young”) underwent HU at three months of age, while a group of retired male breeders (referred to as “older males”) began HU at nine months of age. Normally loaded (NL) controls were individually housed in standard vivarium cages. Animals were suspended onto the pulley apparatus via orthopedic traction tape as described previously [11]. NL controls were handled the same way as the HU animals except for the actual attachment of traction tape and tail suspension. HU was conducted for either 14 days or 90 days. A subset of nine-month-old (older) males that underwent HU for 90 days were then released from the suspension apparatus to reambulate normally (Reloading, Rel) for 90 days. All animals were supplied with standard rodent laboratory chow (Purina, St. Louis, MO, USA) and water ad libitum. Enrichment consisted of Diamond Twists paper sticks (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN, USA) and I-Chews (Newco, Hayward, CA, USA) and replenished as needed. Room temperature was maintained within a range of 20–26 °C with a 12-h light and 12-h dark cycle. After the designated duration of HU, animals were euthanized via isoflurane overdose followed by exsanguination and decapitation. Tissues were collected shortly thereafter. Hearts were bisected, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until processing. Refer toTable S1for the sample sizes of the experiment groups included in this study. Young male and female, 90 day HU, and recovery groups were not included in the study either due to insufficient sample sizes or unavailability of appropriately processed samples. 2.2. Processing of Frozen Heart Samples Frozen hearts were retrieved from −80 °C storage and placed on a metal platform that was pre-chilled with liquid nitrogen. Left ventricular tissue was excised from the anterior to posterior ends (apex) of the heart. The excised left ventricular tissue was further cut into thirds (anterior, middle, and posterior). The anterior and posterior thirds were processed for DNA and RNA extraction, respectively. Samples were excluded from analyses if anatomical landmarks could not be conclusively identified for isolation of left ventricular tissue. 2.3. RNA Extraction from Cardiac Tissue Total RNA was extracted from frozen left ventricular tissue using the RNeasy Fibrous Tissue Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA) according to manufacturer’s protocol. RNA concentration was determined using NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), and purity was determined using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Only samples showing an RNA integrity number (RIN) > 8 were used for RNA sequencing and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). First-strand DNA was synthesized from total RNA as follows. A total of 450 ng of RNA was used for a 30 uL first strand synthesis. Briefly, 1.5 uL of random hexamers (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA, Cat# N8080127), 1.5 μL dNTPs (Qiagen, Cat# 1005631), and 12 μL of water were mixed, incubated at 65 °C for 5 min, and immediately chilled on ice. A solution-containing 3 μL RNase-free water, 6 μL 5× first strand buffer (Invitrogen, Cat# Y02321), 3 μL DTT (Invitrogen, Cat# Y00147), and 1.5 μL RNase Out (Invitrogen, Cat# 100000840) was added to the abovementioned mix and then incubated at 37 °C for 2 min. Then 1.5 μL of Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus (MMLV) reverse transcriptase (200 U/μL, Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA, Cat# 28025013) was added to the resulting solution and incubated as follows: 25 °C for 10 min, 37 °C for 50 min, and 70 °C for 15 min. All incubation steps were performed using a TC-312 thermocycler (Techne, Vernon Hills, IL, USA). First-strand DNA was stored at −80 °C until use for qPCR using the Taqman system. Multiplex PCR reactions were set up to measure both genes of interest and housekeeping gene expression in the same well of a 384-well plate. A premade gene expression master mix (Taqman, LifeTechnologies, Waltham, MA, USA, Cat# 4369016) was utilized, and each reaction was completed in duplicate. FAM-labeled Taqman probes (LifeTechnologies, Waltham, MA, USA) were used for the following genes of interest: nuclear factor, erythroid 2-like 2 (Nfe2l2,Rn00582415_m1), superoxide dismutase 1 (Sod1, Rn00566938_m1), superoxide dismutase 2 (Sod2, Rn00690588_g1), and sirtuin 1 (Sirt1, Rn01428096_m1). VIC-labeled ribosomal protein L19 (Rpl19, Rn00821265_g1) was used as housekeeping gene. qPCR was performed on a QuantStudio 6 Flex Real-Time PCR instrument (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA, USA). The relative gene expression levels for HU groups relative to age- and sex-matched controls were determined by the ΔΔCt method and reported as fold change. 2.5. 8-Hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) Assay Total DNA was extracted from frozen left ventricular tissue using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer’s protocol. Quantification of 8-OHdG was performed using OxiSelect™ Oxidative DNA Damage ELISA Kit (Cell Biolabs Inc., San Diego, CA, USA, Cat# STA-320) following manufacturer’s specifications. Enzyme reaction/absorbance was measured using a Spectra Max 250 (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA) and Softmax Pro 5 software. 2.6. RNA Sequencing and Bioinformatics Analysis Poly(A)+-enriched cDNA libraries were prepared using the Illumina TruSeq RNA Library Prep kit (Illumina Inc., Hayward, CA, USA) and sequenced using Illumina NextSeq 550 (Illumina Inc., Hayward, CA, USA) instrument to generate 75 bp single-end reads. Sequencing data quality was checked using FastQC (version 0.11.5) software. Subsequently, reads were mapped to the rat reference genome (rn6) using STAR (version 2.6.0c). Then, a matrix of read counts per gene was generated using “featureCounts” from the Rsubread package (version 1.30.5). Genes with low expression values were filtered from downstream analysis by requiring more than 5 reads in at least 6 samples for each gene. Subsequently, between-sample normalization was performed using EDASeq (version 2.16.0). One sample from each group had to be excluded from analysis due to technical issues. Hence, 6 samples per group were used for the succeeding analysis. RUVseq (version 1.16.0) [RUVs with k = 4] was used to estimate the factors of unwanted variation. Genes differentially expressed between HU and control samples were identified using DESeq2 (version 1.22.2), controlling for factors of unwanted variation. Hierarchical clustering analysis was performed and heat maps generated using Morpheus, with Pearson method selected [20]. RStudio analysis software (Version 1.1.419), together with ggplot2 (version 3.1.1), ggrepel (version 0.8.0), and Bioconductor (DESeq2 version 1.22.2) packages, were used to obtain principal component analysis plots. For gene enrichment analysis, differentially expressed genes meeting a log2 fold change cut-off of >0.3 or <−0.3 and an adjustedp-value < 0.05 were input into Toppfun [21,22]. Toppfun was used to assess functional enrichment of DEGs based on ontologies, gene family, phenotype (human disease), and pharmacome (drug–gene associations). Of the 125 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), 121 matched the contents of the Toppfun database and were therefore included in the list for gene enrichment analysis. The DEGs that had no match in the Toppfun database wereClec4a1,Lilrb3l,Fcna, andMill1. Gene enrichment analysis was performed at a false discovery rate (FDR, Benjamini Hochberg) of <0.05 and a gene limit of 2 or greater. GO Terms were plotted for visualization using the matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, and pandas packages run in Google Colaboratory (Python ver 3.10). Equivalence of variance was first evaluated by Levene’s test. Once equal variance was confirmed, at-test was performed to compare HU and matched control groups. This study involved an extended sampling period (3 years). To minimize batch effects, we compared HU and the matched controls for any given sex and timepoint since these groups were collected within the same period. Specifically, any HU group and its normally loaded control group (e.g., young male 14 day HU and NL groups) were euthanized on the same day or a day apart. Comparisons were not made across timepoints, sexes, or ages. Statistical analyses were performed using JMP software version 13.1.0 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Data shown are mean +/− S.D.

The underlying bases for the observed upregulation of complement genes in HU hearts is unclear. In Earth-based cardiovascular disease, altered fluid distribution and pressure changes can give rise to injury of cardiac tissue and therefore may play a role in the upregulated complement response seen in this rodent model for microgravity-induced fluid shifts. Complement activation also can occur as a response to pathogens or their constituents. Hence, another possibility that requires further study is the role of gut permeability in promoting a complement response during simulated microgravity. HU has been reported to alter the gut microbiome, cause damage to intestinal villi, and compromise the structural integrity of tight junctions [40], which can lead to gut leakiness. Indeed, HU can cause a transient release of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in circulation and changes in the distribution of neutrophils and lymphocytes, [41] as well as an increase in circulating levels of the potent pro-inflammatory cytokine interferon γ (IFNγ) [42]. Further, synthetic bacterial DNA has been shown to induce a robust inflammatory response in the heart of mice [43]. Consistent with a potential role of gut permeability, we found upregulation ofCD14in 14-day HU hearts.CD14is a surface receptor expressed in circulating monocytes/macrophages, which binds to LPS to induce an immune response [44]. Other key genes involved in the inflammatory response were also upregulated after 14 days of HU, includingCD163andCD68.CD163is a marker for activated macrophages.CD163+ macrophages promote angiogenesis, vessel permeability, and leukocyte infiltration [45] and are increased in hearts of simian immunodeficiency virus-infected monkeys [46]. Further,CD68marks the monocyte/macrophage population. Both expression levels ofCD68and immunopositive cell counts increase in the hearts of mice exposed to spaceflight-relevant doses (<0.5 Gy) of radiation [47]. In addition, HU in mice increased hippocampalCD68levels, which mark activated microglial populations [48,49]. Collectively, the upregulation ofCD14,CD68, andCD163expression would be consistent with macrophage infiltration in HU hearts. Humans in future deep space missions will experience extended periods of low-dose space radiation and microgravity. Hence, the impact of the predicted upregulation of macrophage activity on human cardiovascular health requires further study.Tlr8also was upregulated in the hearts of 14-day HU animals. Accumulating evidence demonstrates the important role of TLR signaling in the development of cardiovascular disease [50,51], whereasTlr8transcripts increased in patients with enterovirus-induced dilated cardiomyopathy [52].
