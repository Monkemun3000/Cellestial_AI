The use of film media involves considerably less preparation, waste, and incubator space than conventional agar-media-based assays and has proven in past studies to provide counts of cultivable microbes similar to those of traditional agar media. Film media also have the advantage of allowing sample volumes similar to those used in pour plates and, therefore, are well-suited for cultivable microbial counts in extremely low-biomass environments such as clean rooms or space habitats, particularly where the subsequent isolation of colonies is necessary. As the preparation of film media plates relies on water cohesion/adhesion rather than manual spreading, they may have future applications in low- or microgravity settings. In this study, cultivable microbial count performance was compared between agar media and film media in three kinds of samples: food items, surfaces in built environments on Earth (homes), and on the environmental surfaces of the International Space Station (ISS). Easy Plates (Kikkoman Corporation) and Petrifilm (3M) were compared with traditional agar plating for food and home surfaces, while only Easy Plates were compared with agar for ISS samples. For both food items and built environments on Earth, both types of film media performed comparably to agar media for bacterial counts, with R2values of 0.94–0.96. Fungal counts for built-environment samples had a lower correlation between film and agar counts, with R2values of 0.72–0.73. Samples from the ISS, which ranged from below detection to 103CFU per 100 cm2, had R2values of 0.80 for bacterial counts and 0.73 for fungal counts, partially due to multiple samples recording below the detection limit for agar or too numerous to count, and the growth of fungal species on R2A medium. The species compositions of isolates picked from agar vs. film media plates were similar; however, further phylogenetic analysis is needed to confirm the differential microbial diversity composition. Overall, film media such as Easy Plates and Petrifilm are viable alternatives to agar plates for low-biomass built environments as well as for food samples, and the two brands tested in this study performed equally well. For the last 50 years, miniaturized stackable media called “film” media have been available as alternatives to traditional agar [14]. Petrifilm was developed by 3M in the 1980s as an alternative to agar spread and pour plates. It consists of a thin wafer of nutrient/gelling agent between two plastic films. Petrifilm was designed to plate 1 mL of a sample on a surface with the approximate size and volume of a playing card, using dyes such as tetrazolium to indicate colony growth [15]. This greatly reduces both the volume of incubator space needed to grow a large number of samples and the time and materials needed to prepare agar plates. According to 3M, Petrifilm media “take up 85% less space, reduce waste 66%, greenhouse gas emissions by 75%, and water waste by 79%” compared with agar plates [15]. Recently, Kikkoman/Dai Nippon Printing (DNP) has developed another brand of film media, Easy Plates, which are similar to Petrifilm in many respects but which have the advantage of a hydrophobic resin ring surrounding the medium which negates the use of a spreader tool, reducing preparation time even further. In addition, the Easy Plate design purportedly increases the ease of counting by its reduced liquefaction of the gel compared with Petrifilm [16]. Most studies testing film vs. agar media performance for cultivable microbial counts have focused on high-bioburden environments and samples such as dairy products and food, or samples/surfaces that are pre-inoculated with a known microbial consortium. Film media are only recently being assessed for cultivable microbial counts in extremely low-biomass environments such as clean rooms and hospitals [31,32,33]. Recently, researchers from NASA compared Petrifilm Rapid Aerobic Count (RAC) plates with tryptic soy agar (TSA) plates for measuring the bioburden of an extremely low-biomass clean room environment and found that Petrifilm was equal to TSA plates in aerobic bacterial estimation [31]. In addition, Petrifilm was found to be superior to TSA in containing colonies that could spread and grow to cover 25% or more area of agar plate [31]. Kikkoman’s Easy Plates have not yet been compared in the scientific literature for their performance relative to both agar plates and Petrifilm. While film media have been previously used in place of agar plating to assess cultivable microbial counts for built environments and hospitals [30], they have not been tested in extremely low-biomass environments, particularly those with high fiber counts. Additionally, because Easy Plates entirely rely on water adhesion/cohesion forces for inoculation rather than manual spreading, it is likely that they could be viable options for environmental monitoring in micro- or low-gravity settings in future space installations. Therefore, our objectives for this study were to (1) test the bacterial enumeration performance among agar plates, Petrifilm, and Easy Plates for a variety of food items; (2) compare the cultivable microbial counts in an Earth-built-environment setting for agar plates, Petrifilm, and Easy Plates using bacterial- and fungal-specific media; and (3) test the efficacy of Easy Plates as an alternative method for bacterial and fungal bioburden estimation and the isolation of bacterial and fungal strains for surface samples from the ISS, for both cultivable microbial counts and species composition of isolates. 2.1. Descriptions of Petrifilm and Easy Plate Media Tested According to the manufacturer’s instruction manuals, Petrifilm Aerobic Count (AC) Plate [15] (3M, Saint Paul, MN, USA, Cat# 6400) and Easy Plate AC [16] (Kikkoman, Noda, Chiba, Japan, Cat# 61973) were used for the enumeration of aerobic bacteria, and Petrifilm Rapid Yeast and Mold Count (RYM) Plate (3M, Cat# 6475) and Easy Plate YM-R (Kikkoman, Cat# 61977) were used for the enumeration of yeast and mold in the food and beverage industries. In general, in food and beverage microbiological testing, both the Petrifilm AC and Easy Plate AC count red colonies after 48 h of incubation at 35 °C. Petrifilm RYM counts blue-green colonies after 48 h of incubation at 25 °C or 28 °C, and Easy Plate YM-R counts purple colonies after 48 h at 25 °C. Both media can extend the incubation time up to 3–7 days if the colonies appear faint. 2.2. Food-Item Cultivable Microbial Counts and Media Testing 2.3. Built-Environment Cultivable Microbial Counts and Media Testing The surfaces of Japanese homes (n = 5) were sampled for bacterial and fungal cultivable microbial counts. At each home, three different surfaces were sampled: one expected low-bioburden (example: window glass), one expected medium-bioburden, and one expected high-bioburden (example: living room floor) sample. Pro-media ST-25 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) swab kits from ELMEX LIMITED (Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, Japan), consisting of a cotton swab in 10 mL of sterile PBS, were used to swab the surfaces and were kept refrigerated (~4 °C) until use. In each home, for each surface, a 100 cm2area was sampled in all cases except for complex shapes (such as doorknobs) in which case the shape was thoroughly wiped over its entire surface area, and the swab was returned to the sterile PBS and shaken. Aliquots of 1 mL of undiluted and 1 mL of 10−1diluted samples were plated on 6 types of media for each sample: traditional plate count agar (PCA) pour plate, Easy Plate AC, and Petrifilm AC to target aerobic bacteria, and conventional potato dextrose agar (PDA, BD Diagnostics Cat #213400) with 0.05 g/L chloramphenicol pour plate, Easy Plate YM-R, and Petrifilm RYM to target environmental fungi. Plates were incubated for 7 days at 25 °C, with cultivable microbial counts taken on Day 2 and Day 7; however, if plates were close to being too numerous to count on Day 2, colonies were counted and not incubated further. 2.4. International Space Station Sampling and Media Testing Upon delivery to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), the wipes were separated into batches and stored at 4 °C until processing. All wipes were processed within 48 h of arrival at the JPL for the isolation of environmental microbes. All lab procedures were performed for all samples within a 12 h period. Each wipe was placed in a sterile 500 mL bottle with 200 mL sterile PBS and vigorously shaken for 2 min. In addition to the 45 ISS samples, an unopened wipe and a bottle of a sterile buffer without the addition of wipes were used as negative controls; no colonies resulted from these samples; thus, those data are not reported here. The PBS was then concentrated using an InnovaPrep CP-150 (Innovaprep LLC, Drexel, MI, USA) with a 0.2 µm Polysulfone hollow-fiber-concentrating pipette tip. Using additional sterile PBS, the resulting PBS concentrate was adjusted to 4 mL for all samples, and dilutions of 10−1, 10−2,and 10−3were prepared. Inoculation and cultivable microbial counting:Two replicate spread plates were prepared for all three dilution levels (10−1, 10−2,and 10−3), using two types of agar media: Reasoner’s 2 agar (R2A, BD Diagnostics Cat # 218263) and PDA plates supplemented with 0.05 g/L chloramphenicol, for a total of 12 plates per sample (2 agar types × 3 dilution levels × 2 replicates; ~540 plates in total). This occupied a total of almost 0.1 cubic meters, the equivalent of a large moving box. For each of the two types of film media (Kikkoman Easy Plate AC and Easy Plate YM-R), 1 mL of the 10−1dilution was directly pipetted into the center of each plate and then sealed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Agar and film plates were incubated at room temperature for 7 days; cultivable microbial counts were performed on Days 2 and 7. For ISS samples, PetriFilm media were not used. Isolation, purification, and identification of ISS strains:After cultivable microbial counting, up to 5 isolates were chosen from each combination of media type and sample. On both the agar plates and Easy Plates, colonies were deliberately selected for morphological differences, size, and colony coloration on agar plates. Colonies from Easy Plates were first streaked out onto TSA/PDA plates, incubated at 25 °C for 7 days, and imaged, before being transferred to 1:10 agar stabs of respective media. Similarly, the colonies from agar plates were directly transferred to respective agar stabs. The isolates were later streaked out for purification onto TSA or PDA plates. The secondary streak plates of purified isolates were sent to Azenta Life Sciences (Southfield, NJ, USA) for colony PCR + Sanger sequencing for the 16S rRNA gene or the ribosomal Internal Transcriber Space (ITS) region, respectively, for bacteria and fungi. Primers 27F and 1429R (27F 5′-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3′; 1492R 5′-GGTTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3′) [37] were used to target the entire 16S region (V1-V9) for bacterial strains. ITS regions 1 and 2 were targeted for fungal taxonomy using primers ITS1-F and ITS4 (ITS1 5′-CTTGGTCATTTAGAGGAAGTAA-3′; ITS4 5′-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3′) [38]. Per Azenta Life Sciences standard operating procedure, enzymatic cleanup was performed after amplification using Exonuclease I—Shrimp Alkaline Phosphatase (ExoSAP), and dye-terminator Sanger sequencing was performed using an Applied Biosystems BigDye version 3.1 sequencing kit using an Applied Biosystem 3730xl DNA Analyzer.

Species and Genus Distributions for Bacterial and Fungal Isolates In general, the use of film media over agar allows for lower costs, greatly increased inoculation speed, greatly reduced experimental preparation time, and much smaller amounts of space required in incubators or counters; these advantages have been discussed in numerous previous reports [28]. When dealing with high volumes of samples that must be processed in a very short amount of time, film media such as Petrifilm and Easy Plates provide distinct advantages. In processing the ISS samples, plating the same number of samples on Easy Plates took one person 2 h, as opposed to three people taking 8 h to inoculate the agar plates. The use of film media or pour plates requires fewer dilutions than spread plates because it can produce accurate plate counts at higher bioburden levels, which is not necessarily a fair comparison of the time spent. However, in addition to a pipetting step, spread plates require either retrieving a pre-sterilized spreader from its packaging or sterilizing a reusable spreader and thoroughly spreading the sample over the surface without damaging the agar. For upwards of 300 agar plates per experiment, this adds up to multiple hours. In this study, we found no particular advantage or disadvantage to using Petrifilm (3M) vs. Easy Plates (Kikkoman), except for the lack of necessity of using a spreader for Kikkoman plates. The cultivable microbial counts for built-environment samples and food samples correlated extremely well with counts from agar media and with each other. The one exception to this trend was the bacterial counts from raw poultry products, where Petrifilm and Easy Plate cultivable microbial counts correlated well with each other but did not correlate with agar; given the small number of poultry samples (n = 4), this trend would need to be investigated further to be considered significant. The species distribution for film media vs. agar media was similar between both fungal-specific and bacteria-specific plates. Three main differences were that (1) yeast colonies grew but were not visible on Easy Plate AC (although non-yeast fungal colonies were visible and countable), whereas yeast colonies were of course visible on R2A; (2) Easy Plates isolated multiple strains ofMicrococcus, whereas R2A did not; and (3) isolation from R2A allowed for the isolation of single strains of slow-growing low-nutrient-loving bacterial species not isolated on Easy Plates, from minuscule colonies. In some cases, the minuscule colony had a distinct color that allowed us to select it as a colony of interest from the agar, whereas on the Easy Plate, it was not distinguishable from other colonies; in some cases, there was only a single tiny colony on the agar plate vs. no colony on the Easy Plate, which could be due to random chance: In at least two cases, there would have been no way to pick the rare species out, and it was chance that led us to collect it. Inoculating well-grown colonies isolated from R2A onto Easy Plate AC medium allowed the growth of these minuscule colonies. Picking colonies out by their relative size on film media is difficult, as the dye used in Petrifilm and Easy Plates magnifies the size of tiny colonies. Additionally, without a clear view of colony morphology and color that agar provides, it is possible that isolating “rare” species might have been overlooked. This could be an advantage or disadvantage of film media depending on the goals and study design (it removes non-random sampling biases, but if one is sampling non-randomly, it may result in a lower diversity of isolates). Other disadvantages of film media are that (1) because of the smaller surface area and the miniaturization of colonies, it was difficult to count colonies by eye for high bioburden samples, and in a few cases, counting from magnified photographs was necessary (3M has developed an automated CFU counter for use with Petrifilm plates, which negates this issue), and (2) because colony color was not observable, and morphology was somewhat obscured in film media, it would be extremely difficult to rule out the colonies of a known contaminant that appeared also in control plates (for example, in a situation where samples are plated out in the field or in otherwise non-laboratory conditions). Surfaces in built environments inhabited by humans and animals are inherently difficult to consistently sample for cultivable microbial counts, due to having higher fungal:bacterial ratios and the presence of hairs and fibers, which adsorb bacterial and fungal spores, thus requiring multiple replicates to obtain an accurate count. Even with every effort made to vortex or otherwise homogenize samples before plating, in extremely low-biomass environments, the presence or absence of a single hair or fiber might make the difference between a zero and non-zero cultivable microbial count, or a lower or higher cultivable microbial count. Human habitation and the accompanying presence of dust, fibers, and hairs from bodies and cloth, combined with extremely low surface biomass due to constant cleaning and well-filtered air, is a combination peculiar to hospital environments [40], clean rooms [41], and space habitats [42,43]; however, because astronauts do not wear masks, gloves, or other protective equipment aboard the ISS, the problem of hairs and fibers is exacerbated. One study tested the efficacy of Petrifilm vs. contact plates on regular hospital surfaces and found that Petrifilm detected larger numbers of cultivable microbes [32]; however, cultivable microbial counts in that study were higher than what would be considered “low bioburden” (i.e., comparable to a clean room or the ISS). In a study of debris and lint collected via vacuuming the ISS surfaces, fibers and hairs—as opposed to tinier particles such as skin cells with a greater surface area—yielded a distinct microbial community with greater fungal diversity and only one order of magnitude fewer cultivable microbes than powdery debris despite a vastly smaller surface area [42]. Therefore, the use of a larger volume is critical for accurate plate counts. As film media use a 10× higher volume than traditional spread plates, while not presenting the same challenges of possible heat death (molten agar at 55 °C) and excavation that isolating bacteria and fungi presents when using pour plates [44,45], film media are well-suited for use with samples from the ISS and other future space habitats. In fact, because film media are extremely light, and thin, and rely on water cohesion and adhesion rather than gravity or manual spreading, they may be suitable for testing in microgravity in the future and may be a possible method for both food and environmental safety testing for future space habitats.
