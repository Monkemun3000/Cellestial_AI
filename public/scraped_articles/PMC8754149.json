In an ongoing microbial tracking investigation of the International Space Station (ISS), severalSphingomonasstrains were isolated. Based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence, phylogenetic analysis identified the ISS strains asSphingomonas sanguinis(n= 2) and one strain isolated from the Kennedy Space Center cleanroom (used to assemble various Mars mission spacecraft components) asSphingomonas paucimobilis. Metagenomic sequence analyses of different ISS locations identified 23Sphingomonasspecies. An abundance of shotgun metagenomic reads were detected forS. sanguinisin the location from where the ISS strains were isolated. A complete metagenome-assembled genome was generated from the shotgun reads metagenome, and its comparison with the whole-genome sequences (WGS) of the ISSS. sanguinisisolates revealed that they were highly similar. In addition to the phylogeny, the WGS of theseSphingomonasstrains were compared with the WGS of the type strains to elucidate genes that can potentially aid in plant growth promotion. Furthermore, the WGS comparison of these strains with the well-characterizedSphingomonassp. LK11, an arid desert strain, identified several genes responsible for the production of phytohormones and for stress tolerance. Production of one of the phytohormones, indole-3-acetic acid, was further confirmed in the ISS strains using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Pathways associated with phosphate uptake, metabolism, and solubilization in soil were conserved across all theS. sanguinisandS. paucimobilisstrains tested. Furthermore, genes thought to promote plant resistance to abiotic stress, including heat/cold shock response, heavy metal resistance, and oxidative and osmotic stress resistance, appear to be present in these space-relatedS. sanguinisandS. paucimobilisstrains. Characterizing these biotechnologically important microorganisms found on the ISS and harnessing their key features will aid in the development of self-sustainable long-term space missions in the future. IMPORTANCESphingomonasis ubiquitous in nature, including the anthropogenically contaminated extreme environments. Members of theSphingomonasgenus have been identified as potential candidates for space biomining beyond earth. This study describes the isolation and identification ofSphingomonasmembers from the ISS, which are capable of producing the phytohormone indole-3-acetic acid. Microbial production of phytohormones will help futurein situstudies, grow plants beyond low earth orbit, and establish self-sustainable life support systems. Beyond phytohormone production, stable genomic elements of abiotic stress resistance, heavy metal resistance, and oxidative and osmotic stress resistance were identified, rendering the ISSSphingomonasisolate a strong candidate for biotechnology-related applications. Sphingomonasspecies are found in a variety of habitats, including soil, marine sediments, wastewater, and freshwater, in addition to the habitats contaminated with dyes, herbicides, and other pollutants (1–3). They possess diverse catabolic capabilities; for instance, assimilation of different types of complex sugars, including polysaccharides, was reported (2). Some species are tolerant to copper, resulting in biofilm formation and eventually surface corrosion (4), and some aid in herbicide mineralization or degradation of pollutants (5–7).Sphingomonas paucimobilishas been isolated from the International Space Station (ISS) potable drinking water (8), ISS surfaces (9), and hospital clinical specimens and is known to cause rare infections in immunocompromised individuals (2,10,11). Recent reports have identified the role of someSphingomonasspecies in plant growth promotion (5,12–14). Microorganisms aid in plant growth promotion via different mechanisms, including secreting metabolites like phytohormones, solubilizing phosphate, fixating nitrogen, inducing stress response pathways, or acting as biocontrol agents (5,14–19). Phytohormones play a significant role in plant metabolism and defense mechanisms (20). For instance, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) is responsible for promoting cell division, elongation, and differentiation (21) and is involved in a wide range of plant processes ranging from responses to light and gravity to heavy metal stress tolerance (22,23). Recent studies have detailed the role ofSphingomonasspecies in plant growth promotion via the production of phytohormones and increased stress tolerance.S. paucimobilisZJSH1 produces phytohormones like IAA, salicylic acid, zeatin, and abscisic acid and helps in nitrogen fixation (14).Sphingomonassp. LK11, isolated from the leaves of the arid medicinal plantTephrosia apollinea, was shown to produce auxins and gibberellins and was reported to increase stress tolerance to salinity and cadmium in tomato plants (12,15,24). In addition, genomic analysis ofSphingomonassp. LK11 also revealed genes for hydrogen peroxide production that enhance plant growth, seed germination, and root colonization, genes for phosphate uptake, osmotic stress, and heavy metal stress (15). Genomic analysis ofSphingomonas panacisDCY99Tisolated from the roots ofPanax ginsengidentified genes for IAA production, phosphate solubilization, heavy metal stress tolerance, and degradation of phenolic compounds (5). Furthermore,Sphingomonassp. Cra20 was shown to improve plant growth under drought stress conditions by altering the rhizosphere microbial community (13). The ability of microorganisms to produce phytohormones thus offers the potential to manipulate plant growth and development but without the need to supplement hormones externally to the plants. Abundance ofSphingomonasspecies in the ISS. Genomic characteristics ofSphingomonasstrains isolated from the ISS and cleanroom KSC-PHSF cleanroom floor: Kennedy Space Centre- Payload Hazardous Servicing Facility. ANI values shown are calculated against their respective type strainsS. sanguinisNBRC 13937 andS. paucimobilisNCTC 11030. % Values in parentheses indicate the proportion of genes among the total number of genes. The abundance ofSphingomonasspecies across different flights and locations on the ISS based on metagenome-derived genomic reads. The numbers on top of bars represent the number ofSphingomonasspecies identified from that particular location in the corresponding flight number (F1, F2, or F3). Different locations on the ISS from where samples were collected: location 1, port panel next to cupola (node 3); location 2, waste and hygiene compartment (node 3); location 3, advanced resistive exercise device (ARED) foot platform (node 3); location 4, dining table (node 1); location 5, zero G stowage rack (node 1); location 7, panel near portable water dispenser (LAB); and location 8, port crew quarters, bump out exterior aft wall (node 2). Plant growth-promoting features inSphingomonasspecies isolated from spaceflight environments. BLAST-based genome comparisons visualized using BLAST Ring Image Generator (BRIG) revealed relatively high levels of identity shared across each spaceflight genome and their type strains compared against theSphingomonassp. LK11 genome (Fig. 2). Additionally, patterns of GC content for eachS. sanguinis(66.1 to 66.2%) andS. paucimobilis(65.5%) genome were highly similar to that of LK11 (66.09%). Subsequent pangenome comparisons conducted by Anvi’o revealed a substantial core genome and further support both shared nucleotide and functional identity among these spaceflightSphingomonasgenomes, their type strains, and the endophyteSphingomonassp. LK11 (Fig. 3). Pangenome analysis ofS. sanguinis,S. paucimobilisgenomes obtained from space-relevant surfaces with their type strains, andSphingomonassp. LK11, generated by the Anvi’o software. Primary functional annotation in Anvi’o was conducted using the anvi-script-FASTA-to-contigs-db and anvi-run-ncbi-cogs commands. Subsequent pangenome gene clustering was carried out using blastp via the anvi-pan-genome command (–num-threads 2, –mcl-inflation 6, –min-bit 0.5, –use-ncbi-blast). Ordering of the pangenome display was determined using a Euclidean distance clustering algorithm and the provided ward linkage method. Beginning from the innermost ring and moving outward, rings 1 to 8 correspond to gene clusters identified in each of the analyzedSphingomonasgenomes in the following order: 1,Sphingomonassp. LK11; 2,S. paucimobilisFKI-L5-BR-P1; 3,SphingomonasLCT-SP1; 4,S. paucimobilisNCTC 11030T; 5,S. sanguinisIIF7SW-B3A; 6,S. sanguinisIIF7SW-B5; 7,S. sanguinisISS-IIF7SWP (MAG); 8,S. sanguinisNBRC 13937T. Ring 9 shows a density plot of the number of genes within the identified gene clusters, and ring 10 highlights single-copy gene clusters (black). Rings 11 and 12 correspond to the geometric homogeneity index and functional homogeneity indices of similarity, with the former accounting for gaps in alignments, while the latter scores functional similarities by residue within the aligned sequences. The outermost ring represents the location of known Clusters of Orthologous Genes (COG) functional categories. The right-most bar chart corresponds to the number of singleton gene clusters, number of gene clusters, number of genes, total length, and GC content for each genome present in the analysis. Due to the high degree of functional identity shared between each of the spaceSphingomonasspecies andSphingomonassp. LK11, functional annotations for each of the spaceflightSphingomonasgenomes and their type strains were conducted to identify putative PGPF. Functional analysis of these outputs revealed that many PGPFs proposed forSphingomonassp. LK11 (15) are likely also present in the analyzedS. sanguinisandS. paucimobilisgenomes. Annotations reported from the EggNOGv5 database suggest that several gene products proposed to promote phosphate and sulfur assimilation in plants are also present in these selectSphingomonasstrains, albeit with some species-specific patterns. Pathways associated with phosphate uptake metabolism and solubilization in soil appear to be conserved across all the selectedS. paucimobilisandS. sanguinisstrains; however, gene products associated with sulfate/thiosulfate and hydrogen production may be exclusive to the selectedS. sanguinisstrains. Furthermore, several pathways proposed to promote plant resistance to abiotic stress, including the heat/cold shock response, heavy metal resistance, and oxidative and osmotic stress resistance, appear to be shared between these selectedS. sanguinisandS. paucimobilisgenomes. (A) Zeaxanthin and nostoxanthin pathway. (B) Genes discussed relevant to trehalose metabolism inS. sanguinisandS. paucimobilis. In the first step of theotsA/Bpathway, a condensation reaction between glucose 6-phosphate and UDP-glucose synthesizes trehalose 6-phosphate (otsA). Second, a dephosphorylation of trehalose 6-phosphate catalyzed byotsByields the product trehalose. Additionally, trehalose can also be formed from the rearrangement of the α(1,4) glycosidic bonds of glucose polymers to α(1) glycosidic bonds viatreY, allowing for the hydrolysis of the terminal trehalose disaccharide viatreZ. (C) Proposed pathway for IAA production inS. paucimobilisandS. sanguinisusing functional predictions generated by eggNOG-MapperV2. Enzyme classes are denoted in brackets, with gene, enzyme, or protein names provided where appropriate. Purple coloring denotes identified enzyme classes that were identified only in the analyzedS. paucimobilisspaceflight strains. Question marks (??) denote yet-to-be-validated reaction mechanisms in the proposed pathway. Chemical structures were constructed using the ChemDraw software. These findings suggest that the testedSphingomonasspecies, including the strains sequenced from spaceflight-relevant surfaces, contain several pathways likely to confer resistance to a variety of abiotic stressors, especially with respect to several antioxidant enzymes and metabolites. The presence of these features supports the potential role of these newly sequencedSphingomonasstrains to promote plant growth and increase plant stress tolerance. Indole-3-acetic acid production byS. sanguinisandS. paucimobilisstrains isolated from the ISS. Since the genomic analysis of the spaceflight isolates revealed genetic signatures for the production of several plant growth-promoting hormones, metabolomic characterization was carried out to identify the phytohormone IAA. AllSphingomonasisolates obtained from spaceflight-relevant surfaces were cultured in the presence of tryptophan, and metabolites extracted from the culture filtrate were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection-mass spectrometry (HPLC-DAD-MS). The MS data analysis showed the presence of IAA among the metabolites extracted from all three strains,S. sanguinisIIF7SW-B3A,S. sanguinisIIF7SW-B5, andS. paucimobilisFKI-L5-BR-P1 (Fig. 5A). The production of IAA (molecular weight, M = 175.18 g/mol) by these isolates was confirmed by comparing the electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) profile (positive mode: M+H = ∼176 g/mol) of IAA standard with culture extracts, either alone or mixed with IAA standard (Fig. 5A). The ESI-MS profile of all the three culture extracts was found to be comparable with the standard. Further, the production of IAA was validated by tandem mass spectrometry to generate a mass fragmentation profile in positive mode, corresponding to M+H of ∼176 g/mol. The three culture extracts resulted in a fragmentation pattern that was similar to the IAA standard, generating three different fragments, including a parent ion of ∼176 g/mol (Fig. 5B). In contrast, the presence of IAA was not observed in nutrient media without tryptophan (data not shown). Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) data also revealed the presence of few other metabolites with molecular weights similar to those of other phytohormones; however, their positive identification will require further analysis, which is outside the scope of this study. (A) LC-MS profile of IAA produced byS. sanguinisandS. paucimobilisflight isolates, compared to the standard. (B) LC-MS/MS spectrum of IAA standard compared to that produced byS. sanguinisandS. paucimobilisflight isolates, all generating similar fragmentation patterns. Functional differences between ISSSphingomonasisolates and their type strains. Analysis of plant growth-promoting features suggested the potential for conserved functional characteristics between the spaceflight and type strains ofS. paucimobilisandS. sanguinisgenomes but with some distinctions. Therefore, functional differences were further explored through hierarchical clustering of the relative abundance of functional categories assigned by the eggNOG database (Fig. 6). Intriguingly, the selectedSphingomonasgenomes clustered primarily according to the environment in which they were sampled (terrestrial type strains versus spaceflight-relevant surfaces at KSC and the ISS) and then clustered according to their species assignment. Examining the relative abundance of each of the assigned functional categories, it is clear that a sizeable portion (∼20% to 21%) of each of these selectedSphingomonasgenomes lack known functional roles, highlighting novel gene products that are ripe for future bioinformatics and molecular characterization. Yet, differences in functional products corresponding to the category L, replication, recombination, and repair, are noticeably higher in genomes of the strains isolated from spaceflight-relevant surfaces. Hierarchical clustering of the relative abundances for eggNOG functional categories for each of the selectedSphingomonasstrains. Counts of each functional category were normalized to the total number of annotated proteins within each genome. The y-axis displays eggNOG functional category letter codes corresponding to the following: A, RNA processing and modification; B, chromatin structure and dynamics; C, energy production and conversion; D, cell cycle control, cell division, chromosome partitioning; E, amino acid transport and metabolism; F, nucleotide transport and metabolism; G, carbohydrate transport and metabolism; H, coenzyme transport and metabolism; I, lipid transport and metabolism; K, transcription; L, replication, recombination and repair; M, cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis; N, cell motility; O, posttranslational modification, protein turnover, chaperones; P, inorganic ion transport and metabolism; Q, secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport and catabolism; R, general function prediction only; S, function unknown; T, Signal transduction mechanisms; U, intracellular trafficking, secretion, and vesicular transport; V, defense mechanisms; W, extracellular structures; Y, nuclear structure; Z, cytoskeleton. (A) UpSetR plot showing the intersection of named eggNOG predicted proteins fromS. sanguinisandS. paucimobilisgenomes obtained from space-relevant surfaces and their respective type strains. Total named eggNOG protein counts from each strain are shown in a horizontal bar plot (left) and the number of shared named eggNOG proteins among the strains are represented in the vertical bar plot (right). (B) JVENN plot displaying the intersection of named EggNOG proteins according to their species and environment (S: space-relevant surface, T: type strain), where the named eggNOG proteins were pooled by category for simpler comparisons. Color schemes denote both the species and their environment of origin (green:S. paucimobilisspace-relevant surface isolate, blue:S. paucimobilistype strain, pink:S. sanguinisspace-relevant surface isolate, yellow:S. sanguinistype strain). In addition, analysis of metabolic pathways of spaceflightSphingomonasstrains also suggested that each strain is likely capable of producing the carotenoids zeaxanthin and nostoxanthin. Zeaxanthin has been suggested to play a number of roles in both bacteria and plants, including photoprotection, detoxification of ROS, and resistance to ionizing radiation (32). Indeed, high levels of zeaxanthin production in the bacteriumParacoccus zeaxanthinifacienswere shown to promote resistance to ionizing, UV radiation, and hydrogen peroxide; however, resistance among the selectSphingomonasstrains was weaker than that amongP. zeaxanthinifaciens(33). Additionally, zeaxanthin also serves as a metabolic precursor for the formation of the plant phytohormone abscisic acid, prompting speculation that zeaxanthin-producing, plant-associated microbes may promote plant growth by supplying plant hosts with carotenoid derivatives such as zeaxanthin (34). Prompted by differences in functional compositions betweenSphingomonasstrains obtained from spaceflight-relevant surfaces (KSC, ISS, Shengzhou Rocket X), intersectional analysis of orthologous groups of spaceflight-relevant genomes against their type strains was performed. Analysis of KEGG-associated annotations provided by eggNOGv5 showed the presence of several genes in space-relatedSphingomonasisolates that were not otherwise found in their respective type strains.S. sanguinisspaceflight isolates showed the presence oftragenes involved in pilus assembly and conjugal transfer (traF,trbC,traU,traW,trbI,traC,traV,traB,traK,traE,traL, andtraH) and those involved in mating pair stabilization (traGandtraN), which were absent in the type strain (46). Some groups have previously reported the occurrence of conjugal transfer in bacteria under microgravity conditions (47–49). Therefore, the presence oftragenes inS. sanguinisspaceflight isolates indicates the existence of conjugal transfer under space conditions that might also be responsible for acquiring genetic materials from related bacterial species. In addition,S. paucimobilisFKI-L5-BR-P1 showed the presence of genes involved in quorum sensing:lasI(acyl-homoserine lactone synthase), acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs) biosynthesis, and LuxR family transcriptional regulator. AHLs act as signaling molecules through which LuxR regulates the expression of a number of genes, some of which are potentially associated with virulence (50). AntiSMASH analysis ofS. paucimobilisFKI-L5-BR-P1 spaceflight isolate also showed the presence of a gene cluster (region 6.1; Fig. S1) involved in the synthesis of a homoserine lactone (Hserlactone). Further, KEGG analysis also showed the presence of some genes involved in the production of industrially important metabolites in the spaceflight isolates. For instance, bothS. sanguinisandS. paucimobilisspaceflight isolates showed the presence of modules associated with the biosynthesis of antibiotics like erythromycin A/B and vancomycin, which were absent in the type strains. Another important pathway that was highlighted in these spaceflight isolates is the betalain biosynthesis pathway and the presence of gene 4,5-DOPA dioxygenase extradiol. The enzyme dioxygenase extradiol is involved in opening the cyclic ring of dihydroxy-phenylalanine (DOPA), resulting in the formation of an unstable seco-DOPA that further rearranges to form betalamic acid, the structural unit of betalains (51). Betalains are known to be majorly produced byCaryophyllalesplants (e.g., the red and yellow pigments found in beets) and some fungal species; however, one bacterial species,Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus, was recently reported to produce betalains (52). They are known to have antioxidant activity, are reported to be effective against some cancer cells, and also promote anti-inflammatory response (53–55). In addition, KEGG Orthology analysis indicated the presence of some genes inS. sanguinisspaceflight isolates that may have been acquired to help them survive the use of antibiotics, as noted by multiple studies of other microbial species on the ISS (26,56–59). For instance, the mercury resistance operon present in some bacteria contains mostly three genes:merR(transcriptional regulator),merT(inner membrane mercury scavenging protein), andmerP(periplasmic mercury scavenging protein) (60), which were also found inS. sanguinisspaceflight and type strains. In addition to these three genes, the spaceflight-relevant isolates also showed the presence ofmerB(alkylmercury lyase),merE(mercuric ion transport protein), andmerD(MerR family transcriptional regulator, mercuric resistance operon regulatory protein), which are not present in all bacteria containing the operon. Previous studies have reported that severalmergenes (merDandmerE) were more likely to be encoded on plasmids or transposons and, therefore, can be transferred via horizontal gene transfer (61), which might also be the case forS. sanguinisspaceflight isolates.S. sanguinisspaceflight isolates also contained genercnA, belonging to nickel/cobalt transporter family protein. This study utilized comparative genomics and identified a plethora of factors inSphingomonaspresent in spaceflight environments that may result in the production of several PGPFs and aid in the growth of plants. The production of one of the phytohormones IAA was also confirmed using metabolomics. These spaceSphingomonasstrains, along with other plant growth-promoting strains of microbes isolated from the ISS (62), therefore, hold great potential to contribute to space exploration through promoting and controlling plant growth as part of an integrated bio-regenerative life support system enabling future extended-duration crewed missions. Sample collection and whole-genome sequence analysis. Sample collection and processing, followed by WGS and assembly that led to the isolation ofSphingomonasstrains, are described elsewhere (25,63). Samples collected across different locations on the ISS, and the KSC-PHSF cleanroom, were plated on Reasoner’s 2A agar (R2A) to culture different bacterial colonies (25). In addition to cultivation, previously published metagenomic sequences sampled from ISS locations were downloaded from NCBI (26) and analyzed for the presence ofSphingomonasspecies, and MAGs were generated. DNA extraction was followed by metagenomic sequencing and assembly as described previously (26). Identification ofSphingomonasspp. from metagenomic assembly was performed as described elsewhere (59). In the case ofS. sanguinisgenome assembled from the metagenome, sample collection, processing, and DNA extraction were carried out as reported previously (26). The assembled draft genomes were annotated using NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline (PGAP) 4.11 (64,65). The identity of the strains was confirmed based on ANI calculated using EZBioCloud (66). To further explore potential functional differences between spaceflight isolates and their respective type strains, we obtained coding sequences from the NCBI RefSeq database and, where applicable, performed additional annotation through the online eggNOG-mapperV2 web server using the default settings (67,68). The coding sequences of the metagenome-assembled genome ofS. sanguinisISS-IIF7SWP were retrieved from the NCBI GenBank database. Coding nucleotide sequences for eachSphingomonasgenome along with their respective type strains were annotated using the online eggNOG-MapperV2 software, whose column-based outputs were parsed and compared on a per-genome basis using a custom python script (available for use viahttps://github.com/jlombo96/Sphingomonas-EggNOG-Workbook). Preliminary annotations of these select spaceflight isolates highlighted potential connections to the plant endophyteSphingomonassp. LK11, a strain well characterized with respect to its plant growth-promoting capabilities (12,15,24,27,69). Given the presence of a thoroughly annotated and complete genome sequence (15), robust evidence for the production of the plant phytohormones gibberellic acid (GA) and IAA (12,15), and previous use as a model for novel plant-associatedSphingomonasgenomes (5),Sphingomonassp. LK11 was selected as a reference genome to identify putative plant growth-promoting features in otherSphingomonasgenomes. In this study, the endophyteSphingomonassp. LK11, twoS. sanguinisisolates (IIF7SW-B3A and IIF7SW-B5), and oneS. sanguinisMAG (ISS-IIF7SWP) sampled from the ISS,S. paucimobilisFKI-L5-BR-P1 cultured from KSC-PHSF, andS. paucimobilisLCT-SP1 isolated from the Chinese spacecraft Shenzhou X were compared against their respective type strains:S. sanguinisNBRC 13937TandS. paucimobilisNCTC 11030T. Metabolite extraction and analysis. Previous reports have characterized the phytohormone production capability of severalSphingomonasspecies, includingSphingomonassp. LK11 (11),S. panacisDCY99T(5), andS. paucimobilis ZJSH1(14). While bothS. paucimobilisZJSH1 andSphingomonassp. LK11 were confirmed to produce the plant phytohormone IAA, the definitive chemical pathway responsible for their production is yet to be elucidated (12,14,15). Therefore, the potential for the production of the auxin-derivative IAA in each of the selectedS. paucimobilisandS. sanguinisstrains was examined. The space isolates (S. sanguinisIIF7SW-B3A,S. sanguinisIIF7SW-B5, andS. paucimobilisFKI-L5-BR-P1) were streaked on R2A (Difco, USA) and incubated at 28°C for 5 days. The strains were then inoculated in nutrient broth (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) containing 3 g/Ll-tryptophan (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and incubated at 28°C, 180 rpm for 7 days. To examine the phytohormones produced and secreted in culture filtrate, we pelleted the cells and extracted the metabolites from the supernatant using ethyl acetate. This step was repeated twice. The culture supernatant was then acidified using 6N HCl and metabolites were extracted using ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate layer after each step described above was transferred to a fresh tube and evaporated in TurboVap LV. The residue obtained after drying the solvent was resuspended in 5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)/95% (vol/vol) methanol at a final concentration of 1 mg/mL. A suitable aliquot of the extract (10 μL) was injected for HPLC-DAD-MS analysis. Stock solution of IAA standard (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) was prepared in 5% DMSO/95% methanol (vol/vol) at a concentration of 1 mg/mL. It was diluted 10 times, and 10 μL of the dilution was injected for HPLC-DAD-MS analysis. HPLC-DAD-MS was carried out using Thermo Finnigan LCQ Advantage ion trap mass spectrometer with an RP C18column (Alltech Prevail C183 mm 2.1 by 100 mm) at a flow rate of 125 μL/min. The solvent gradient for liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) was 95% (vol/vol) acetonitrile (MeCN)/H2O (solvent B) in 5% MeCN/H2O (vol/vol; solvent A), both containing 0.05% (vol/vol) formic acid, as follows: 0% solvent B from 0 to 5 min, 0% to 100% solvent B from 5 min to 30 min, 100% solvent B from 30 to 45 min, 100% to 0% solvent B from 45 to 45.10 min, and reequilibration with 0% solvent B from 45.10 to 50 min. Comparative functional analysis. Genome similarities between spaceflightSphingomonasstrains, their respective type strains, and the plant endophyteSphingomonassp. LK11 were visualized using BRIG version 0.95 with theSphingomonassp. LK11 (chromosome and plasmids) assigned as the reference genome (70). Percent identity values for space isolates and corresponding type strains were calculated using blastn (E value: 10, lower identity cutoff: 70%, upper identity cutoff: 90%). To address potential functional differences between space isolates and their corresponding type strains, custom Python and R scripts (https://github.com/jlombo96/Sphingomonas-EggNOG-Workbook) were designed to parse output annotation tables and summarize their features on a per-genome basis. Descriptions for select KEGG IDs identified in eggNOG-MapperV2 were assigned using the BioServices API (71). To identify protein-level differences between theSphingomonasstrains obtained from spaceflight-relevant surfaces and their respective type strains, custom python scripts were created to construct pileup gene count tables for the annotations generated from the EggNOG-MapperV2 software. Genes identified by eggNOG-MapperV2 for theS. paucimobilisandS. sanguinisspaceflight isolates were pooled on a species basis and then compared to their type strains using JVENN (72) and UpSetR (73) using intersection analyses. Output tables generated by these analyses are displayed in Table S1. Pangenome analysis of theSphingomonasspace isolates, their type strains, and the plant endophyteSphingomonassp. LK11 was performed using Anvi’o v6.2 (74–76). Primary functional annotation in the Anvi’o software was conducted using the anvi-script-FASTA-to-contigs-db and anvi-run-ncbi-cogs commands. Subsequent pangenome gene clustering was carried out using blastp via the anvi-pan-genome command (–num-threads 2,–mcl-inflation 6,–min-bit 0.5,–use-ncbi-blast). The ordering of the pangenome display was determined using Euclidean distances and ward linkage settings.
