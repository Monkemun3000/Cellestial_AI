The development of high-throughput pyrosequencing and phylogenetic microarray techniques has dramatically increased the resolution and detectable spectrum of diverse microbial lineages from environmental samples (Soginet al., 2006;La Ducet al., 2009;Mendeset al., 2011). However, DNA-based molecular technologies alone have yet to be validated for assessing the differential viability of cells across varying phylogenetic lineages in a complex microbial assemblage. DNA-derived signals, which originate from both living and dead cell types, often lead to interpretations that overestimate the viable microbial population present (Rogerset al., 2008;Pointinget al., 2009). Quantitative PCR (qPCR)-based analyses increase the speed, sensitivity and specificity of quantitative microbial detection (Hierroet al., 2006;Yanezet al., 2011). Unfortunately, qPCR techniques alone cannot differentiate live from dead cells, as the latter contribute template DNA to the overall PCR amplification (Cawthorn and Witthuhn, 2008). The persistence of nucleic acids post-cell death renders cogent estimations of live–dead cellular ratios in a given sample practically impossible, as naked DNA will ultimately result in the overestimation of total cells (Nockeret al., 2006). The treatment of microbial cell suspensions with propidium monoazide (PMA), which first intercalates and on photo-activation, covalently binds DNA, before DNA extraction followed by downstream PCR and related molecular analyses has become an increasingly popular technique for the selective detection and enumeration of viable microbes (Heinet al., 2006;Nockeret al., 2006;Wagneret al., 2008;Bae and Wuertz, 2009). The use of PMA for discriminating live from dead cells has been studied across various applications and research testbeds, including food (Cawthorn and Witthuhn, 2008), biosolids (van Frankenhuyzenet al., 2011), infectious enteric viruses in water samples (Parshionikaret al., 2010), fungi (Vesperet al., 2008), bacteriophage T4 (Fittipaldiet al., 2010), infectious parasitic protozoa (Bresciaet al., 2009) and wastewater treatment plants (Linet al., 2011). Recently, PMA treatment has been used in combination with crude microarray analysis for assessing cell viability (Nockeret al., 2009). In addition, pyrosequencing profiles of water samples exposed to high temperature and treated with and without PMA have been comparatively analyzed (Nockeret al., 2010). Abbreviations: Bldg, building; bTEFAP, bacterial tag-encoded FLX amplicon pyrosequencing; GSE, ground support equipment; JPL, Jet Propulsion Laboratory; MOTU, molecular operational taxonomic unit; PMA, propidium monoazide; qPCR, quantitative PCR; rRNA, ribosomal RNA; SAF, spacecraft assembly facility. Nine individual samples (each 1 m2) were collected using Biological Sampling Kit and pooled. All filtered samples were divided into two separate aliquots (500 ul each; equivalent to 4.5 m2), one to be subjected to PMA pre-treatment (viability assessment), and the other to serve as a null environmental sample (viable+non-viable; total DNA). The JPL–SAF is the most frequently utilized cleanroom facility, as spacecraft assembly was underway at the time of sampling. In contrast, Bldg 144 was inactive and not in use when samples were collected. The only human traffic in the Bldg 144 facility before sampling was the janitorial servicing, which occurred once a week, or to address any other miscellaneous maintenance issues. Other metadata such as usage rate, and so on, are not in place. The dimensions of the JPL-SAF cleanroom were larger and surface area of the GSE materials were more in JPL–SAF than in Bldg 144. The amount of total 16S rRNA PCR product subjected to hybridization on PhyloChips was normalized across samples (∼400 ng) whenever possible. The total volume of initial PCR product used for subsequent emulsion PCR was 2 μl for strong positives (>10 ng μl−1; all non-PMA samples), 5 μl for weak positives (5 to 10 ng μl−1; GI-42-1(p)) and 20 μl for samples that failed to yield PCR products (<5 ng μl−1; all PMA-treated samples except GI-42-1(p)). This normalization step enhanced retrieval of maximum number of sequences. An all-purpose cleaning and degreasing agent (Kleenol 30, Accurate Industrial Supply, Inc., Cerritos, CA, USA, Cat #: J-CC-00040) was used to maintain cleanliness of the floor. Surface cleaning procedures were performed twice a day in the cleanroom during periods when spacecraft componentry was actively undergoing assembly (SAF; sample #GI-36). In contrast, the quiescent Bldg 144 environmental test facility certified cleanroom was cleaned only once a week since spacecraft hardware was not present in this facility at the time of sample collection. Both of the cleanroom facilities examined were maintained with stringent protocols pertaining to the replacement of tacky mats, vacuuming and mopping of floors, and wiping down of GSE surfaces with alcohol. In addition, before entering, staff were required to don cleanroom garments and comply with appropriate practices to minimize the influx of particulate matter. Sample volumes were extracted from BiSKit devices as instructed by the manufacturer, a total of three times with 15 ml of PBS each. Previous studies have demonstrated that spacecraft-associated surfaces house extremely low-biomass and seldom yield detectable PCR amplification products (Moisslet al., 2007;Vaishampayanet al., 2010). Hence, all samples collected from the same general location or site were pooled together. The biological materials resulting from each pooled sample (∼400 ml each) were further concentrated using Amicon Ultra-50 Ultracel centrifugal filter tubes (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Each filter unit has a molecular mass cutoff of 50 kDa, which facilitates the concentration of bacterial cells, spores and exogenous nucleic acid fragments >100 bp in a final volume of 1 ml. All filtered samples were divided into two separate aliquots (500 μl each), one to be subjected to PMA pre-treatment (viability assessment), and the other to serve as a null environmental sample (viable+non-viable; total DNA). All samples, both with and without PMA pre-treatment were subjected to DNA extraction via the Maxwell 16 automated system (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and resulting DNA suspensions (100 μl each) were stored at −20 °C. A 500 μl aliquot of filter-concentrated sample suspension was treated with 12.5 μl of PMA (2 mℳ; Biotium, Inc., Hayward, CA, USA) to a final concentration of 50 μℳ (Rawsthorneet al., 2009;Nockeret al., 2010), followed by thorough mixing and incubation in the dark for 50 min at room temperature. The tubes were inverted manually 5–6 times over a 10-min incubation interval to promote homogeneous PMA exposure. Sample tubes were then placed horizontally atop a bed of ice and exposed to a 500-W halogen lamp (Osram 64553 C318; Danvers, MA, USA) at a distance of 20 cm for 3 min. Samples without PMA treatment were also subjected to incubation in dark for 50 min and exposure to 500-W halogen lamp on ice along with PMA-treated samples. Bacteria-directed primers (1369F and 1492R) targeting the16S ribosomal RNA(rRNA) gene were used for qPCR analysis (Suzukiet al., 2000). Each 25 μl reaction mixture consisted of 12.5 μl of Bio-Rad 2X iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Hercules, CA, USA), 10.5 μl of UltraPure water (Gibco; Grand Island, NY, USA), 0.5 μl of forward primer 1369F (10 μℳ), 0.5 μl of reverse primer 1492R (10 μℳ) and 1 μl of DNA template. Purified standards and UltraPure Gibco water no-template controls were included in all qPCR runs. Thermal cycling parameters for universal16S rRNAgene qPCR were as follows: hold at 95 °C for 3 min to achieve initial denaturation, followed by 40 cycles of: 10-s hold at 95 °C to denature, ramp-down to 55 °C for primer annealing and extension occurring through a 35-s ramp-up to 95 °C. In this study, all samples were analyzed in triplicate. Bacterial16S rRNAgenes were amplified from DNA preparations from each sample using the primers 27F (5′-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3′) and 1492R (5′-GGTTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3′). PCR conditions were as follows: 1 cycle of initial melting for 3 min at 95 °C, followed by 35 cycles of 30-s melting at 95 °C, 30-s annealing over a 48–58 °C gradient (48 °C, 48.8 °C, 50.1 °C, 51.9 °C, 54.4 °C, 56.3 °C, 57.5 °C and 58 °C), and 2-min extension at 72 °C, with a final 10-min incubation at 72 °C. The amount of total16S rRNAgene PCR product subjected to hybridization on PhyloChips was normalized across samples (∼400 ng) whenever possible. A detailed explanation of the processing of the PhyloChip assay has been described elsewhere (Hazenet al., 2010). Stage 1 and stage 2 analysis were performed and the cross-hybridization response score was adjusted as previous described (Cooperet al., 2011). Following stage 2 analysis, hybridization intensities were transformed (log2*1000) and were henceforth referred to as transformed hybridization intensities. Representative PTU sequences were then compared against the taxonomic architecture of the SILVA database (Pruesseet al., 2007) and PTU were grouped at the genus level. In order to be identified as having been enriched in the PMA-treated samples, PTU had to meet the following two criteria: (a) the PTU must be deemed present based on standard PhyloChip analysis in PMA-treated samples and (b) the corresponding PTU must be present in greater transformed hybridization intensity in the PMA-treated sample fraction than in the non-PMA-treated sample fraction. One representative16S rRNAgene sequence within each PTU was selected, a multiple sequence alignment was generated with the SINA aligner (Pruesseet al., 2012), and a neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree was compiled at the family level with MEGA 4 (Tamuraet al., 2007). This tree was rendered in a circular manner with the iTOL tree viewing program (Letunic and Bork, 2011). Tag-encoded FLX amplicon pyrosequencing Bacterial-biased primers 28F (5′-GAGTTTGATCNTGGCTCAG-3′) and 519R (5′-GTNTTACNGCGGCKGCTG-3′) were used to amplify ∼500-bp fragments spanning the V1–V3 hypervariable regions of the bacterial16S rRNAgene. This primer pair was tailored for bTEFAP by adding a fusion linker and a proprietary 12-bp barcode sequence at the 5′ end of the forward primer, and a biotin and fusion linker sequence at the 5′ end of the reverse primer (Dowdet al., 2008). A HotStarTaq Plus master mix kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) was used to catalyze the PCR under the following thermal cycling conditions: initial denaturing at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturing at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 54 °C for 40 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min, finalized by a 10-min elongation at 72 °C. Resulting PCR products were purified via Rapid Tip (Diffinity Genomics, Inc., West Henrietta, NY, USA) chemistry, and were then pooled accordingly. Small fragments (<100 bp) were removed with Agencourt Ampure Beads in accordance with manufacturer's instructions (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA). In preparation for FLX-Titanium sequencing (Roche, Nutley, NJ, USA), resulting PCR amplicon fragment size and concentration were accurately measured with DNA 1000 chips using a Bioanalyzer 2100 automated electrophoresis station (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and a TBS-380 Fluorometer (Turner Biosystems, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The total volume of initial PCR product used for subsequent emulsion PCR was 2 μl for strong positives (>10 ng μl−1), 5 μl for weak positives (5 to 10 ng μl−1) and 20 μl for samples that failed to yield PCR products (<5 ng μl−1). This normalization step helped to ensure minimal bias favoring downstream amplification from initially strong PCR products. Approximately 9.6 × 106molecules of ∼600-bp double-stranded DNA were combined with 9.6 × 106DNA capture beads, and then subjected to emulsion PCR conditions. Following recovery and enrichment, bead-attached DNA molecules were denatured with NaOH and sequencing primers were annealed. A 454 pyrosequencing run was performed on a GS PicoTiterPlate using the Genome Sequencer FLX System in accordance with manufacturer's instructions (Roche). In all, 24 to 30 tagged samples were applied to each quarter region of the PicoTiterPlate. All bTEFAP procedures were performed at the Research and Testing Laboratory (Lubbock, TX, USA) in accordance with well-established protocols (Dowdet al., 2008). bTEFAP-derived bacterial diversity and data analysis Bacterial TEFAP sequences were processed and analyzed using the MOTHUR software package (Schlosset al., 2009), with the AmpliconNoise algorithm implemented. Raw pyrosequencing data for the PMA-untreated samples was derived from previously published work and was re-analyzed alongside PMA-treated samples (La Ducet al., 2012). Previously described standard operating procedures were followed for the analysis of sequence data in this study (Schlosset al., 2011). Sequences were removed from consideration if they (a) did not contain the primer sequence, (b) contained an uncorrectable barcode, (c) were <200 nt in length, (d) had homopolymers longer than 8 nt or (e) had a quality score of <25. Unique sequences were aligned using the Greengenes reference alignment (Schlosset al., 2009;McDonaldet al., 2012) and trimmed such that all the sequences overlap in the same alignment space. Filtered sequences were assigned to samples according to their 12-nt barcode. After removing chimeras, sequences were classified in accordance with the new Greengenes training set and taxonomy (McDonaldet al., 2012;Werneret al., 2012), and clustered into MOTU at the 0.03 level (that is, at 97% similarity) (Schlosset al., 2011). During this study, a negative control whereby a BiSKit was only pre-moistened with PBS, and a handling control, in which a BiSKit was pre-moistened with PBS and exposed to the sampling environment, were also prepared. These negative and handling controls were processed and analyzed both with and without PMA treatment before DNA extraction. All of the resulting qPCR indices for these controls were below detection limit. BacterialbTEFAPsequencing was not performed on any of these controls because PCR amplification did not yield any quantifiable product. Although no detectable PCR amplification products were available, all negative and handling controls were run on a PhyloChip in order to detect possible contaminants. The resulting 447 PTU (of 8943 PTU in total) detected were omitted from the entire analysis. Only one PTU was detected in one handling control after PMA treatment. No PTU were detected in any of the negative or sampling controls after PMA treatment, supporting the conclusion that the detected PTU originated from extraneous DNA, and not from viable microbes associated with sampling materials or reagents. Multiple statistical analyses were performed to study the differences between the PMA-treated and non-PMA samples, all of which were based on (a) the abundance of sequences of each MOTU and (b) the transformed hybridization intensities of each PTU. This included principal coordinate analysis (PCoA), multi-response permutation procedures and Adonis testing (999 permutations), all of which were based on Bray–Curtis distance measures. Dendogram clustering was based on Euclidean distance. Diversity indices (Shannon–Wiener) were calculated for MOTU only. All statistical analyses, including heatmaps, were performed using the R programming environment (R-project 2011, Vegan, MASS and ape packages).

Heatmap of PTU that increased in transformed hybridization intensities in PMA-treated samples compared with non-PMA-treated samples and were called present in the PMA-treated sample. An increase in transformed hybridization intensities in PMA-treated sample is reflected as a positive ratio. In total, 801 PTU were identified that fulfilled this requirement, which were grouped into 70 genera. Displayed are representatives of all genera with the most drastic changes for each sample pair. Numbers in parentheses are the total number of PTU. PCoA based on: (a) number of pyrosequences per MOTU (PCoA1, percentage of explained variance: 22% PCoA2, percentage of explained variance: 17%) and (b) PhyloChip-derived transformed hybridization scores of each PTU (PCoA1, percentage of explained variance: 87% PCoA2, percentage of explained variance: 6%). Open and closed dots represent PMA-treated and PMA-non-treated samples, respectively. Over the past 25 years, sequence analysis of PCR-amplifiedrRNAgenes has become the ‘gold standard' for assessing species richness in mixed microbial communities, and as a result, total resolvable microbial diversity is now estimated to be threefold greater than that based solely on cultivation (Pace, 1997). As sequences from organisms in greatest abundance are far more likely to be represented in clone libraries than those from singleton and low-abundance taxa, it is advantageous to use high-throughput technologies, such as bTEFAP and PhyloChip, which have been shown to render a far superior representation of community structure (Brodieet al., 2006;Soginet al., 2006;DeSantiset al., 2007;La Ducet al., 2009). The most frequently encountered bacterial MOTU from the stringently maintained and frequently cleaned floors of the SAF cleanroom were members of the genera:Bacillus, ClostridiumandNocardia.These bacteria are known to survive oligotrophic conditions for extended periods of time, tolerate alkaline and oxidative stress, and avoid death by ultraviolet radiation by morphing into highly resilient, dormant endospores (La Ducet al., 2007;Ghoshet al., 2010;Probstet al., 2010). Although routine cleaning and maintenance regimens limit the number of bacterial taxa capable of persisting in cleanrooms, hardy spore-forming microorganisms likeBacillusspp., Clostridiumspp. andNocardiaspp. capitalize on their selective advantage and superior fitness and survive—much to the chagrin of those challenged with bioreduction and sterilization of these environments. The presence of these organisms is detected as a result of their (a) viability, or (b) inability to be penetrated by PMA molecules while in a non-viable state. Owing to subtle nuances inherent in the PMA-chemistry-coupled techniques described herein, endospores and non-viable cells having intact cell walls and/or outer membranes will escape PMA treatment (Nockeret al., 2009;Rawsthorneet al., 2009;Probstet al., 2012), and thus be observed as false-positive viable entities. Similarly, sampling and sample processing steps (for example, the composition of the solution to collect and store microorganisms, method for cell concentration and PMA treatment) might affect the viability of the cells but in a recent study such adverse effect of sample handling procedures was not noticed for sea and canal water samples (Kortet al., 2010;Nockeret al., 2010). As was observed via bTEFAP procedures, PhyloChip-based analyses discerned noticeable differences in the bacterial diversity profiles resulting from PMA- and non-PMA-treated samples. One such observation was the reduction in diversity of proteobacteria detected in PMA-treated samples and prevalence of proteobacteria in samples not treated with PMA. Another consistent result was the observed prevalence of Firmicutes in the PMA-treated samples. This suggests that Gram-positive bacteria are more tolerable of the inhospitable conditions of the cleanroom environment that their Gram-negative kin.
