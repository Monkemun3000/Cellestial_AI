Fungi biofilms have been found growing on spacecraft surfaces such as windows, piping, cables, etc. The contamination of these surfaces with fungi, although undesirable, is highly difficult to avoid. While several biofilm forming species, includingPenicillium rubens, have been identified in spacecraft, the effect of microgravity on fungal biofilm formation is unknown. This study sent seven material surfaces (Stainless Steel 316, Aluminum Alloy, Titanium Alloy, Carbon Fiber, Quartz, Silicone, and Nanograss) inoculated with spores ofP. rubensto the International Space Station and allowed biofilms to form for 10, 15, and 20 days to understand the effects of microgravity on biofilm morphology and growth. In general, microgravity did not induce changes in the shape of biofilms, nor did it affect growth in terms of biomass, thickness, and surface area coverage. However, microgravity increased or decreased biofilm formation in some cases, and this was incubation-time- and material-dependent. Nanograss was the material with significantly less biofilm formation, both in microgravity and on Earth, and it could potentially be interfering with hyphal adhesion and/or spore germination. Additionally, a decrease in biofilm formation at 20 days, potentially due to nutrient depletion, was seen in some space and Earth samples and was material-dependent. Biofilms are cell populations that grow embedded in an extracellular matrix (ECM), which has effects on its ability to adhere to itself and to surfaces, and which changes the interaction between cells and nutrients, quorum-sensing molecules, and its environment in general [1]. For example, it is estimated that up to 80% of bacterial and archaeal cells in nature grow as biofilm populations [2]. The ability of fungi, eukaryotic organisms, to form biofilms depends, in part, on the substratum upon which they form [3], and occurs in a six-phase fashion: arrival at substratum, adhesion, colonization, ECM production, biofilm maturation, and dispersal [4]. One of the most important phases in biofilm formation is adhesion and depends largely on cell–surface and cell–cell adhesion. Following adhesion, microbes proliferate and form the ECM. The ECM has antimicrobial-resistant properties complicating the removal of fungal cells from surfaces. If the process of adhesion is blocked, proliferation and formation of the extracellular matrix will be prevented, providing an ideal way to stop biofilm development [5]. The factors contributing to the fungal biofilm adherence are dependent on the species and strain. Past studies have identified hydrophobicity as a determinant for fungal biofilm adhesion, while other studies concluded that hydrophobicity of the material alone is not enough to determine adhesion [6,7]. The lack of a consensus on the role of material hydrophobicity in biofilm adherence complicates the development of a biofilm-resistant material. Because fungal biofilms are challenging to remove from surfaces due to the ECM, fungal biofilms, or molds, which in the context of this investigation are considered equivalent to fungal biofilms, are a concern for human spaceflight for at least two reasons. The first comes from the potential damage to the surfaces (namely equipment) upon which they grow. Fungal biofilms can directly damage surfaces by using the material as a source of energy, or indirectly by degrading it with enzymes and other metabolic byproducts [8]. This is not an unfounded concern, as there have been issues derived from fungal biofilm formation in previous space stations. On the Soviet Salyut 6 space station, fungal biofilms were observed on “piping and equipment behind the panels” [8]. On Salyut 7, fungal growth was found on the water condensation system used for water recycling, the radiator of the thermal system, and on electric connectors and cables, in some of which “holes” on the insulation tape were observed [8]. On the Mir space station, fungal biofilms (Penicillium chrysogenumnow calledPenicillium rubens[9]) started growing on windows’ rubber seals and expanded onto (and damaged) the quartz and titanium frame. Fungal biofilms were also reported on components of the air conditioning system and on cables using the electric insulation as a source of food. Furthermore, there were “zones completely covered with growth of mold fungi destruction of the plates” on the oxygen electrolysis block, and fungal biofilms were observed on the head phone of the EVA suit, lavatory pan, piping of the thermal control system, urine processing assembly, etc. Cosmonauts reported fungal growths, usually observed on moist areas where water condensed over “cold” material surfaces, as yellow or orange, or as “white powder”, sometimes “the size of a football” [8]. Both in the Mir space station as well as in the International Space Station (ISS),Penicilliumhas been the most isolated genus of fungi [10]. Many of the fungi isolated from Mir were known biodegraders of polymers and showed more aggressive post-flight colony formation and biodegradation activity than reference strains, which the authors suggested could have been caused by the exposure to changes in radiation level, magnetic fields, or solar activity [11]. The second reason why fungal biofilms are a concern to human spaceflight is medical in nature. The ECM and altered cell–cell communication via quorum-sensing molecules can increase antifungal resistance and pathogenicity compared to planktonic cells [1,12], and the biofilms can serve as reservoirs of persistent sources of infections [3]. Fungi can cause infections in humans that are harder to diagnose and treat than those of bacterial origin [3], resulting in failure of antifungal therapy, which may require surgical intervention [4] and translate into high mortality rates [3]. Catheters can be colonized by fungal biofilms, from which cells can detach and cause acute fungemia and disseminated infection that may require long-term antifungal treatments. Similarly, fungi can infect the respiratory tract, causing bronchitis and other types of infections [4]. Fungi can cause superficial and invasive infections, [13], particularly among the immunocompromised [14], posing a threat to astronaut health as spaceflight has been shown to compromise immune response [15] and confined environments, such as spacecraft, can increase exposure [16,17]. Particularly,Penicillium rubenshas been reported to cause rare but severe cases of esophagitis, endophthalmitis, and invasive pulmonary mycosis among immunocompromised individuals [18,19,20]. While these challenges are significant for space stations orbiting Earth, even greater complications can arise in long-term missions. For example, in case of an emergency, such as critical equipment failure or urgent medical needs, the crew can potentially be back on the ground in a matter of hours. However, this will not be true for missions beyond the lower Earth orbit (LEO), including trips around the Moon, Earth–Mars transit, or on space habitats on the Moon and Mars [21]. Although microbial planktonic growth has been studied in relative detail in space [22,23,24,25], little is known about fungal behavior in space when grown as biofilms. In fact, to the best of our knowledge, fungal biofilm growth in space has not been assessed and compared to ground controls, particularly how surface area coverage, biomass, and biofilm thickness change as a function of gravity, time, and material upon which they grow. Conversely, focus has been given to bacterial studies [26,27,28]. This was one of the objectives of our Space Biofilms project performed on the ISS. Here, we report on morphological characteristics ofP. rubensbiofilms grown for 10, 15, or 20 days on seven different spacecraft- and nosocomial-relevant materials on board the ISS, and how they compare against their matched ground controls. Separately, we have reported on the original design of this experiment [9] and on the changes in bacterial biofilm formation in microgravity, also as part of our Space Biofilm project [29,30,31]. Due to the frequency of fungal contamination on spaceflight hardware and habitats and the risks fungal colonization poses to astronaut health and mission success, it is critical to better understand the effect of spaceflight on fungal biofilm development. 2.1. Test Matrix: Fungal Strain, Materials, and Experimental Organization Penicillium rubens ATCC®28089™was chosen given the genus ubiquity in space stations and this specific strain’s presence (and damage caused) in the Mir space station [8,11]. The experiment examined the effect of (i) gravity (microgravity on board ISS vs. 1 g control in our lab on Earth), (ii) incubation duration (10, 15, and 20 days), and (iii) material substratum (seven materials tested) on fungal biofilm morphology. As described in further detail in [9], the materials chosen (and why there were chosen) for this experiment were: Aluminum Alloy (Al6061), as it is used in spacecraft structures, thermal control, structures for electronic devices and panels, etc.; Stainless Steel 316 (SS316), as it is used in spacecraft environmental control and life support system (ECLSS) tanks and tubing (including for potable water), and Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) elements, and on Earth in surgical equipment and implants; Quartz, as it is used in spacecraft windows (at least one of them in the Mir space station damaged byP. rubens); Silicone, as it used in space in O-rings and on Earth in urological catheters, surgical incision drains, and respiratory devices; Titanium alloy (Ti-6Al-4V), as it is used in spacecraft structures, antennae, pressure vessels, brackets, fittings, etc., and on Earth in implants; Carbon fiber, as it is used in spacecraft aeroshells and other applications; MIT Nanograss, chosen to be interrogated as a potential solution to fungal biofilm formation in space. This was developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and is the substrate (nanoetched silicon wafer) described in the making of a lubricant-impregnated surface (LIS) without the lubricant oil and treated to increase hydrophobicity [32]. For each of these materials except SS316, six replicates of each incubation time were launched to ISS to be fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at the end of the incubation period (for the post-flight morphology studies presented in this manuscript). SS316 was set up similarly but had 12 replicates per incubation time to enable more in-depth morphology analyses. Additionally, all materials had seven replicates of per incubation time launched to the ISS to be preserved in RNAlater (except MIT’s Nanograss, which only had 6 replicates) for post-flight differential gene expression analyses (samples available through NASA’s space Biology Biospecimen Sharing Program). This yielded a total of 288 space samples. An equivalent set (288 samples) was prepared at the same time as the Earth control. Additionally, a time zero (t0) set of samples that included seven replicates per material was also prepared. The following describes the preparation of the Space Biofilms fungal samples prior to launch. Preparation of space and Earth control samples took place simultaneously at the Eastern Virginia Medical School (EVMS), unless otherwise specified. One lyophilized vial ofP. rubenswas rehydrated with sterile water for 30 h, and then used to inoculate potato glucose agar (PGA, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA, Cat. 70139) plates. After incubation for eight days at 25 °C, the plates were flooded with 6 mL of 1X PBS (Sigma Cat. P4417) and colonies were gently rubbed with an inoculation loop to dislodge spores. The spore solution was then used to inoculate new PGA plates (working plates) in a 6 × 6 grid fashion. The working plates were six days old when used to inoculate the material coupons with spores (Section 2.2.5). 2.2.2. Preparation of Syringes To provide a humid environment ideal for fungal growth, a couple of absorbent mats inside the flight hardware needed to be wet at the experiment’s start (once in microgravity) (described in more detail inSection 2.2.5). Additionally, the experiment’s termination for morphology samples consisted of fixation with 4% PFA, while for transcriptomic samples, of preservation in RNAlater. In preparation for these tasks, 3 mL syringes filled with 3 mL of sterile distilled water, and 5 mL syringes filled with 4 mL of 4% PFA (diluted with 1X PBS from 16% PFA, Alfa Aesar, Haverhill, MA, USA, Cat. 43368) or RNAlater (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. R0901) were prepared ahead of time. Silicone risers (Saint Gobain, Courbevoie, France, Cat. D1069809) were shortened to 13 mm height at BioServe Space Technologies, bag washed with 1% Liquinox (m/v) solution (Alconox, White Plains, NY, USA, Cat. No. 16-000-126) in distilled water, rinsed with distilled water, dried at 100 °C, and autoclaved for 30 min at 121 °C (dry cycle) before plate assembly (Section 2.2.5). More details on why these were used and how they were implemented are given inSection 2.2.5. 2.2.4. Preparation of Material Coupons All coupons were submerged in 70% ethanol for 15 min on each side and left to air dry inside the biosafety cabinet to disinfect the material surfaces. Once completely dried, the coupons were submerged in sterile Potato Dextrose Broth (Sigma-Aldrich, P6685) for 30 min and allowed to air dry overnight at room temperature; this supplemented the surface with nutrients to promote fungal growth over the coupons. The next day, coupons were carefully handled (never touching the surface, only the edges) to stick the cardboard side of 1 cm2pieces of double-sided tape (3M, Saint Paul, MN, USA, Cat. No. 9731) to the bottom of the coupons (over the label). The clear side of the tape was then peeled in preparation for spore inoculation (Section 2.2.5). 2.2.5.

The assembled PHABs were transferred to cold stow (4 °C), where they remained at this temperature for pre-launch, launch, and ISS stowage until experiment activation. The reduction in temperature and the placement of plates inside a plastic bag to reduce gas permeability help prevent activation (fungal growth) until samples reach microgravity. Additionally, the PHABs were maintained oriented during pre-launch stowage and during launch so that the coupons were on top to minimize the risk of detachment from the risers. Thet0samples did not undergo any cold stowage, but were immediately activated after inoculation by transferring to 25 °C for 6 h to allow spores to adhere to the surface, then fixed with 4% PFA on Earth. The objective of including these samples was to determine if they showed a discrepancy in spore count between materials at the start of the experiment and to determine if later comparison across material type was valid, or a result of unequal inoculation. The 6-hour incubation was chosen to allow enough time for spore adherence to prevent spores from washing away during staining. 2.3. Experiment Performance—On ISS and on Earth Concept of operations for the Fungal Space Biofilms experiment. LSG = Life Sciences Glovebox, SABL = BioServe’s Space Automated Bioproduct Laboratory incubator on board ISS. The start of the experiment began at sample “activation” when samples were removed from cold stow (after ~12.5 days) and provided with high relative humidity (RH) (> 90%), oxygen availability (ISS’ atmosphere), warm temperature (25 °C), and darkness, rendering the ideal environment for fungal growth. To activate the samples, the PHABs were opened, the plastic bag around the four plates was removed, and the two pieces of absorbent mat (one on the lid and one on the floor of the PHAB) were wet with three water syringes (9 mL total of water per PHAB). Then, the plates were returned to the PHAB, and the PHAB was placed at 25 °C undisturbed for 10 d 2 h, 14 d 19 h, or 20 d 3.5 h. After the designated incubation period, the samples were “terminated” while in microgravity to fix the spaceflight morphology or preserve the spaceflight transcriptome. Termination of the experiment consisted of flooding the wells with either 4% PFA (morphology samples) or RNAlater (transcriptomic samples), and took place inside the Life Sciences Glovebox (LSG). To terminate the samples, the Breathe-Easy membrane was pierced with a needle to inject enough fixative or preservative into each well. The punctured membranes were dried from the outside with sterile gauze, and sterile RNase-free sealing strips (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. Z707392) were placed over to seal the holes left by the needles. Terminated plates fixed with 4% PFA were stowed at 4 °C, and plates preserved with RNAlater at −95 °C on orbit; immediately upon receiving them back on Earth, they were stowed at 4 and −80 °C, respectively, to prevent sample degradation. 2.4. Post-Flight Biofilm Morphology Data Acquisition Upon return to Earth, the plates with the fixed coupons were maintained at 4 °C. When ready for morphology data acquisition, the coupons were transferred (without touching the coupon’s surface with the biofilm) into a new 24-well plate in batches of six or eight (space and Earth control of a respective coupon treated on the same session). Each coupon was stained with a mixture of 400 µL of Calcofluor White (Sigma-Aldrich, 18909-100ML-F), staining the chitin present in fungal cell walls, and 400 µL of Biofilm Ruby (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA,F10318), marking proteins present in the extracellular matrix, for 30 min protected from light. Then, each coupon was gently dipped in distilled water four times to remove excess stain and glued onto a microscope slide. To prepare the slides for microscopy, 65 µL of VectaShield anti-fade hardening mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA, H-1900) and a cover slip were gently placed on top of the coupon. The coupons then stayed protected from light for 2.5 h to allow the mounting medium to harden. Microscopy images were acquired with a Nikon A1 Confocal Microscope using the 40 × 0.6NA objective and the NIS Elements 5.21.03 (Nikon Instruments Inc., Tokyo, Japan) imaging software. Two emission filters were used: 425–475 nm for Calcofluor White and 500–550 nm for Biofilm Ruby, with a 405 nm and 561 nm laser, respectively. The 3D structure of the biofilm was captured using a z-stack (step size of 0.243–2.096, 30 slices minimum), and each coupon was imaged in one large field (2 × 2 fields of 302.35 µm × 302.35 µm each, for a total of 604.70 µm × 604.70 µm). The coupons were always imaged in the center to avoid potential user bias looking for a particular section of biofilm. After imaging the biofilms, a qualitative analysis was performed on all the sample images using the NIS Elements Viewer 5.21.00 software (Nikon Instruments Inc., Tokyo, Japan). The qualitative analysis consisted of describing the morphology of the biofilms to find differences and similarities of the biofilms, namely observations regarding structure and distribution, based on material surface, incubation time, and gravity condition. 2.7. Conversion from .nd2 Files to .tiff Files and Slicing of Images The images taken with the microscope were stored as .nd2 files, which is an incompatible format for quantitative analysis with COMSTAT2. Thus, all the images were converted to .tiff files using ImageJ v1.48 [34]. To this end, the nd2 file was opened in the ImageJ software and the two channels were merged, and then the composite was subsequently converted to RGB color, 8-bit, and finally .tiff file. The ImageJ plugin Slice Remover [35] was used to remove the slices of the image stacks that did not have any relevant biofilm information (i.e., underneath the bottom layer and over the topmost layer where no biofilm signal was recorded). This ensured the software would not yield incorrect biofilm data. 2.8. Quantitative Analysis and Quality Control For the analysis process, COMSTAT 2 software v2.1 [36,37,38] was used as a plugin in ImageJ. The images were converted into OME-Tiff files using the ImageJ macro “Convert to OME-Tiff” to ensure compatibility with COMSTAT 2. Each OME-Tiff file was analyzed using the following parameters: (i) automatic thresholding with Otsu’s Method, and (ii) no connected volume filtering. The measurements produced by the software were (a) biomass and (b) thickness distribution. A proxy for biomass, which will be referred to as biomass for the purpose of this investigation, is calculated in COMSTAT2 as the ratio of volume per unit area. Using the data for 0 µm thickness, we calculated the (c) surface area coverage of the biofilm. As a quality control step, each mask created by COMSTAT2 was compared with the original .nd2 files to check for resemblance between the two files. The images which were far off from the original image were re-analyzed with a manual threshold instead of automatic threshold. The biomass of each of thet0samples was produced by COMSTAT2 using the same methodology. Thickness and surface area were not calculated as these samples only contained spores which could be stacked or clumped together, potentially leading to a false statistical significance when comparing amount of spores. Biomass was hence deemed the best parameter to examine for this set of samples as it takes into account the overall volume occupied by the spores. 3.1.

Space Samples after 20 Days Comparison of biofilm thickness after 20 days of incubation in space conditions on seven different materials. The nomenclature for the significant values is as follows: *: 0.01 <p< 0.05. The primary aim of this investigation was to characterizeP. rubensbiofilm morphology on seven clinically or spaceflight relevant materials both in space and on Earth. All materials were susceptible to fungal biofilm formation, some more than others, regardless of the gravitational condition. The fungal samples had equivalent initial amounts of spores on all material substrates, as there were no significant differences in biomass after 6 h of incubation. Although the temperature was kept close to 25 °C during the incubation time across samples, and despite our efforts to provide a stable environment, the humidity presented significant variations. Specifically, the samples incubated for 10 and 20 days on Earth had RH of approximately half that of the rest of the conditions. Since each PHAB contained samples of all material coupons, this does not affect the comparisons across materials, but it could interfere with comparisons across incubation times and between gravitational regimes. 4.1. The Effect of Microgravity on Biofilm Growth 4.2. The Effect of Material Surface on Biofilm Growth After qualitative analysis of the fungal biofilms, no difference in biofilm shape was observed across materials (Appendix B). However, significant differences in mass, thickness, and surface area coverage of the biofilms between materials were identified. The Nanograss material was of particular interest in this investigation as a potential biofilm-resistant material. Nanograss was the most efficient material at reducing fungal biofilm formation, both in space and on Earth. One potential explanation for the reduced biofilm formation is a reduced strength of adhesion. Spore adhesion was the same across all materials by 6 h time (Appendix A), meaning all spores were at minimum equivalently loosely adhered to the material surface. Adhesion strength, how strongly the fungi adheres to the material, and how much force the spores or biofilm can withstand before being removed are dependent on various material characteristics such as hydrophobicity, roughness, and charge [44]. Hydrophobicity is unlikely to be a factor contributing to the reduced biofilm growth. This is due to hydrophobins, which are proteins that help to determine a fungal spores’ hydrophobicity. One hydrophobin, RodA, has been shown to coat the outside of spores, forming a hydrophobic rodlet layer inAspergillus fumigatus, and other hydrophobins have been identified in hyphae [45,46,47]. An ortholog RodA gene with 100% query cover (E value 0.0, and 90.40% identity) was found inP. rubens(Accession No.AM920436.1) using NCBI’s BLAST Tool, meaning thatP. rubenscould also have hydrophobic spores if this gene is being expressed. Nanograss is a highly hydrophobic material and therefore should allow theP. rubenspores to strongly adhere. Therefore, hydrophobicity is not the factor interfering with spore and hyphal adhesion preventing biofilm formation on Nanograss. Other factors such as surface roughness and charge are likely at play in preventing biofilm growth on Nanograss [44]. In the majority of previous research,P. rubensbiofilms have been grown on gypsum, and data on the effect of roughness and surface charge onP. rubensbiofilm formation are not available. Additionally, data on the roughness and charge of the materials used in this investigation are not available as these properties are manufacturer- and sometimes batch-dependent. Future experiments should measure this material’s properties to examine the effect of different material charges and roughness on biofilm growth on hydrophobic materials. Due to the decreased biofilm formation on Nanograss, this material warrants further studies with varying conditions and strains to determine its full potential as an anti-microbial material. 4.3. The Effect of Incubation Time on Biofilm Growth A decrease in biofilm growth was observed as incubation time increased in three cases: Titanium Alloy Earth samples (mass and thickness decreased between day 15 and day 20 and surface area decreased between day 10 and day 20), Quartz space samples (thickness decrease between day 15 and day 20), and Stainless Steel Earth samples (surface area decrease between day 10 and day 20). Since there was only a thin coat of PDB on the surface of the coupons, it is possible the nutrients were depleted as incubation time increased, causing the fungal biofilms to be in a starvation state. When in unfavorable conditions, small groups of fungal persister cells will form and remain even as other fungal cells die [48]. These cell populations have decreased metabolism and growth, allowing the biofilm to remain at a stable population level until conditions improve and growth can resume [49]. Furthermore,Candida albicans, another fungal species known for biofilm formation, can maintain a consistent population in starvation after an initial drop in cell population [50]. If the biofilms have depleted resources by day 15, a decrease in overall biofilm mass, thickness, and surface area can be expected as the cell population will start to die but maintains a minimum population with the assistance of persister cells. The reduced biofilms observed at day 20 could contain these persister cells, which would allow the biofilm to continue growth during a longer incubation time if the environment becomes favorable again, which could present a possible risk for future long-term missions. Further studies should be conducted to observe the effect of adding more nutrients to the fungal population after 20 days in microgravity. In the future, analyses of persister cells within the biofilm and their gene expression should be conducted, comparing the number of persister cells formed both in space and on Earth. This is especially relevant because the persister cells are more resistant to antimicrobials, and in confined spaces such as spacecraft, they could pose an increased health risk for astronauts. Another possibility for the decrease in biofilm formation on day 20 due to depleted nutrients is the weakening of cell–cell and cell–surface adhesions. Fungi have two types of adhesion proteins which are vital for cell–cell adhesion and cell–surface adhesion, lectin-like adhesions and sugar-independent adhesins [51]. Depleted nutrients decrease the amount of available sugars for the adhesins to bind to, potentially decreasing the strength of cell–surface adhesion. Whether the sugar-independent adhesions are sufficient to maintain a strong attachment is unknown and was not studied in this investigation. However, if the sugar-independent adhesions are insufficient, then fungi with a loose attachment were potentially washed away in the gentle washing steps during staining. Further studies should be conducted to determine if the depleted resources decreased the strength of biofilm adherence. The number of spores inoculated onto the coupons was tested to confirm equivalent spores are transferred using the “dry conidia” method. Analysis of the adhered spores was performed using ImageJ and statistical comparisons between materials were performed with Dunn’s test. No statistically significant difference (p< 0.05) was found between any material types for spore count after 6 h of incubation (Figure A1), with an overall median of 248 spores counted per field of view, or 777 spores/mm2. Spore count per material after 6 h of incubation. Data plotted correspond to the number of spores per field of view (565 × 565 µm2). n = 3 biological replicates. No significant differences between materials (Dunn’s test with Bonferroni correction). Confocal microscopy images of representative biofilms per condition were compiled for qualitative analysis (Figure A2,Figure A3,Figure A4,Figure A5,Figure A6,Figure A7andFigure A8). Calcofluor White stain in blue binds to cellulose and chitin. The Biofilm Ruby stain in red binds to proteins of the biofilm’s extracellular matrix. Images were chosen due to their median amount of biomass, surface area, and thickness to avoid bias. It is important to mention that there were no clear patterns or trends in chitin–protein ratios and that differences portrayed in an image may be true only for that samples and not for the group as a whole. No significant differences in morphology shape were observed between time points and gravity condition. Biofilm growth on stainless steel in space and on Earth after 10, 15, and 20 days.
