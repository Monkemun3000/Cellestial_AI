The extracytoplasmic stress-response pathways inP. aeruginosa,Escherichia coli, and other Gram-negative bacteria involve regulated intramembrane proteolysis and share common features. For example, outer-membrane and periplasmic stress initiates a proteolytic cascade that ultimately degrades a transmembrane anti-sigma factor and releases the sigma factor to up-regulate stress-response genes (Albaet al., 2002;Kaneharaet al., 2002;Walshet al., 2003;Akiyamaet al., 2004;Flynnet al., 2004;Chabaet al., 2007). InP. aeruginosa, proteolysis of wild type MucA, the anti-sigma factor, releases the AlgU sigma factor, which enhances transcription of the genes responsible for alginate biosynthesis from thealgDpromoter (Martinet al., 1993;Woodet al., 2006). InP. aeruginosa, degradation of MucA is normally initiated by cleavage by the AlgW protease at site 1 near the periplasmic face of the inner membrane, continues with cleavage by the MucP protease at site 2 near the cytoplasmic face of the membrane, and is completed in the cytoplasm by AAA+ proteases such as ClpXP (Akiyamaet al., 2004;Albaet al., 2002;Chabaet al., 2007;Flynnet al., 2004;Kaneharaet al., 2002;Qiuet al., 2007;Qiuet al., 2008b;Walshet al., 2003). Two signals are required to initiate this proteolytic cascade. The C-terminal peptides of proteins that accumulate in the periplasm during stress, including outer-membrane proteins (OMPs), bind to the PDZ domains of the trimeric AlgW protease and allosterically activate site-1 cleavage of MucA, but MucB competes for MucA binding and can inhibit this cleavage (Cezairliyan and Sauer, 2009). Recent studies show that lipopolysaccharides (LPS), a key component of the outer membrane, can bind MucB and cause release of MucA (Limaet al., 2013). Here, we identify CupB5 as a novel activator of the alginate-production pathway. CupB5, an adhesive protein, is a member of one of thechaperone/usherpathways (CupA-E) that mediate assembly of pili and play roles in bacterial pathogenesis, adhesion, and biofilm formation (Hullet al., 1981;Marklundet al., 1992;Soto and Hultgren, 1999;Valletet al., 2001;Giraudet al., 2011;Mikkelsenet al., 2009). These secretion systems, which are best characterized in Gram-negative bacteria (Saueret al., 2000;Waksman and Hultgren, 2009), contain a periplasmic chaperone that maintains proteins to be secreted in an unassembled state and an usher that transports these proteins through the outer membrane. We find that overexpression of CupB5 in the absence of its chaperone induces a mucoid phenotype inP. aeruginosaand provide evidence that a peptide signal in CupB5 enhances OMP-activated cleavage of MucA by AlgW, even in the presence of MucB, allowing initiation of AlgU signaling. Overexpression of CupB5 induces mucoidy To identify new alginate regulatory genes, we performed mariner-transposon mutagenesis (Wong and Mekalanos, 2000) in the nonmucoidP. aeruginosareference strain PAO1. We isolated a mucoid variant (PAO1-VE22) and identified the site of a single-copy insertion by inverse PCR and Southern-blot analysis (data not shown). The transposon insertion was six base pairs before the TAG stop codon at the 3′ end ofcupB4(Fig. 1A) and introduced a σ70-dependent PGmpromoter that drove expression of the gentamicin resistance cassette and downstream genes (Rubinet al., 1999). Alginate production by PAO1-VE22 (31 ± 1.5 μg/ml/OD600) was substantially higher than that of PAO1 (8.5 ± 0.02 μg/ml/OD600) after 24 h growth at 37°C. To test if altered expression ofcupB4, cupB5,orcupB6was responsible for the mucoidy of PAO1-VE22, we cloned each individual coding sequence with an N-terminal HA epitope and C-terminal H6tag in pHERD20T under control of an arabinose-inducible promoter (Qiuet al., 2008a). Plasmids expressing the tagged variant of CupB5, but not of CupB4 or CupB6, induced mucoid conversion and high-level alginate production in PAO1 (Fig. 1B). Western-blot analysis indicated that the plasmid-expressed CupB4, CupB5, and CupB6 variants were detectable when overexpressed in PAO1, albeit with fragmentation of CupB5 (Fig. 1C). We conclude that enhanced expression of CupB5 or a CupB5 fragment induces mucoidy and increased alginate in PAO1-VE22. Fig. 1. Overproduction of CupB5 causes mucoid conversion in PAO1. (A) Organization of thecupB1-cupB6gene cluster (www.pseudomonas.com), and location of the transposon insertion site in PAO1-VE22. (B) Alginate production, measured using the carbazole assay, and colony phenotypes (M, mucoid; NM, nonmucoid) were assayed following transformation ofP. aeruginosastrain PAO1 with plasmid HERD20T or variants expressing HA-CupB4-H6, HA-CupB5-H6, or HA-CupB6-H6, and overnight growth of colonies on PIA plates (carbenecillin 300 μg ml−1, 0.1% L-arabinose) at 37°C. Values are averages ± SEM (n=3). (C) Cell lysates of PAO1 carrying appropriate plasmids were electrophoresed on SDS polyacrylamide gels, and Western-blots using an anti-HA monoclonal antibody were used to detect HA-CupB4-H6, HA-CupB5-H6, or HA-CupB6-H6. The rightmost lane shows that HA cross-reactive proteins were absent in PAO1 transformed with the pHERD20T empty-vector. Genetic requirements for CupB5-induced mucoidy Deletion of five single genes required for the AlgU response (algW,mucP,clpX,clpP, oralgU) in PAO1 prevented mucoidy and high-level alginate production when HA-CupB5-H6was overproduced from a plasmid in these strains (Fig. 2A). In-frame deletion ofalgWin PAO1-VE22 also prevented alginate overproduction and mucoidy, a phenotype that was complemented by plasmid expression of AlgW but not AlgW lacking its PDZ domain (Fig. 2B). Consistently, when AlgU-dependent promoters were fused tolacZ and introduced into PAO1-VE22 or PAO1-VE2, a strain in which AlgW is activated by overproduction of MucE (Qiuet al., 2007), β-galactosidase levels were increased markedly compared to the same promoter fusions in PAO1 (Fig. S1). CupB5 is normally an extracellular protein (Rueret al., 2008;Valletet al., 2001). However, its overexpression in the absence of corresponding levels of the CupB4 chaperone and usher could result in periplasmic accumulation that acts directly or indirectly through AlgW to activate alginate production. Fig. 2. Genetic requirements for CupB5-mediated alginate overproduction. (A) Wild-type (WT) or mutant PAO1 strains were transformed with pHERD20 encoding HA-CupB5-H6, grown on PIA plates with 0.1% L-arabinose for 24 h at 37°C to induce HA-CupB5-H6overexpression, and mucoid phenotypes and alginate production were determined. ThealgDgene encodes an enzyme required for alginate production. ThealgU,algW,mucP,clpX, andclpPgenes are required for induction ofalgU-dependent alginate production. (B) Alginate production and mucoid phenotypes of different strains were measured after growth for 24 h at 37°C on PIA plates plus 300 μg m−1carbenecillin and 0.1% L-Ara. In both panels, values are averages ± SEM (n=3). CupB5 contains an internal signal for alginate overproduction Because C-terminal sequences terminating with an aromatic residue and α-carboxylate can activate AlgW, we initially tested if the C-terminal residues of CupB5 (Asn1016-Ile1017-Trp1018) were responsible for activating AlgW and inducing mucoidy. However, overexpression of CupB5 variants with a C-terminal H6tag or containing a deletion of the Asn1016-Ile1017-Trp1018sequence and a C-terminal H6tag still induced mucoidy in PAO1 (Table S1). Thus, the extreme C-terminal residues of CupB5 play little or no role in mediating alginate overproduction. Moreover, overproduction of variants containing just the N-terminal 491 residues of CupB5 also induced mucoidy (Table S1), indicating that a major inducing signal is located in this portion of the protein. Fig. 3. Delineation of the CupB5 signal that activates alginate production. (A) CupB5 variants with C-terminal truncations were cloned into pHERD20T, expressed in strain PAO1, and alginate production following growth in the presence of 1% L-arabinose was assayed. Proteins containing CupB5 residues 1–585 and 1–491 contain the complete GYYYTVV491sequence motif. The remaining proteins contain only a portion of this motif. (B) Western-blot detection using anti-HA monoclonal antibody of truncated CupB5 variants. CupB5 peptides stimulate OMP-activated AlgW cleavage of MucA and partially relieve MucB inhibitionin vitro We initially tested if synthetic peptides including the Thr489-Val490-Val491CupB5 sequence might stimulate alginate production in a manner analogous to OMPs by activating AlgW cleavage of35S-MucA. One peptide (GYYYTVV) corresponded to the seven C-terminal residues of CupB51–491, another (YVGYVTY) was a sequence-scrambled variant, and a third (GYYYT) corresponded to the C-terminus of CupB51–489, which did not stimulate alginate productionin vivo. We assayed the kinetics of AlgW cleavage of35S-MucAin vitroby the production of acid-soluble peptide fragments in the presence of different concentrations of the CupB5 peptides. Each CupB5 peptide stimulated AlgW cleavage of35S-MucA to a small degree, but at far lower rates than a peptide (WVF) corresponding to the C-terminal residues of MucE, a potent activator of AlgW (Fig. 4A & 4B). Thus, the CupB5 peptides do not substitute for OMP-like peptides in robust activation of AlgW cleavage of MucA. Fig. 4. CupB5 peptides relieve MucB inhibition of MucA cleavage by AlgW. (A) Cleavage of35S-labelled MucA (20 μM) by AlgW (0.5 μM trimer) was assayed by the time-dependent release of acid-soluble peptides in the presence of either the OMP-like WVF peptide (400 μM), the wild-type GYYYT or GYYYTVV CupB5 peptides (400 μM), the sequence-scrambled YVGYVTY peptide (400 μM), or a buffer control. (B) Second-order rate constants for MucA cleavage were determined by incubating35S-labelled MucA (20 μM) and AlgW (0.5 μM trimer) with different concentrations of WVF or CupB5 peptides and measuring the time-dependent increase in acid-soluble products. Rates were divided by the MucA and AlgW concentrations to determine activity. Lines are fits to the equation activity = basal + stimulated/(1+(Kact/[peptide])h). Values are averages ± SEM (n=2). (C) Second-order rate constants for cleavage of35S-MucA (20 μM) by AlgW (0.5 μM trimer) were determined as described in panel B in the presence of different combinations of WVF peptide (110 μM), MucB (25 μM dimer), and wild-type or scrambled CupB5 peptides (405 μM). Values are averages of two or more independent trials ± SEM. (D) Second-order rate constants for cleavage of35S-MucA (20 μM) by AlgW (0.5 μM trimer) and WVF peptide (150 μM) were determined in the presence of increasing concentrations of the GYYYT, GYYYTVV, or sequence-scrambled YVGYVTY peptides. Lines are fits to the Hill equation: rate = basal + Vmax/(1 + (Ks/[peptide])h). For GYYYT,Kswas 55 ± 13 μM and h was 2.1 ± 0.9. For GYYYTVV,Kswas 143 ± 31 μM and h was 3.5 ± 2.2. As expected from previous studies (Cezairliyan and Sauer, 2009), addition of MucB suppressed cleavage of35S-MucA by WVF-activated AlgW (Fig. 4C). Moreover, addition of just the GYYYTVV, YVGYVTY, or GYYYT CupB5 peptides did not result in AlgW cleavage of MucA when MucB was present (Fig. 4C). Next, we tested if the wild-type or scrambled CupB5 peptides could relieve MucB inhibition of AlgW cleavage of35S-MucA in the presence of the WVF activating peptide. Importantly, titration of GYYYTVV or GYYYT into reactions containing MucA, MucB, AlgW, and WVF peptide resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the rate of MucA cleavage (Fig. 4D). Almost no increase in MucA cleavage was observed with the scrambled YVGYVTY peptide (Fig. 4D), demonstrating sequence specificity. Interestingly, activation of MucA cleavage by GYYYT occurred at lower peptide concentrations and was less cooperative as judged by the Hill constant than activation by the GYYYTVV peptide (Fig. 4D). Thus, the C-terminal valine residues of GYYYTVV are not necessary for activation of MucA cleavage in the presence of MucBin vitro. Although the GYYYTVV and GYYYT peptides activated AlgW cleavage of MucA to similar levels in the presence of WVF peptide and MucB, these levels were approximately one-third of the MucA cleavage rate observed with WVF and AlgW alone (compareFigs. 4B and 4D). We conclude that the CupB5 peptides can partially relieve MucB inhibition of WVF-activated AlgW cleavage of MucA. Lipopolysaccharides bind MucB and competitively displace MucA (Limaet al., 2013). Because MucB normally binds peptide sequences in MucA, it seemed plausible that CupB5 peptides might also compete for MucA binding to MucB. We tested this possibility by assaying the ability of the CupB5 peptides to elute35S-MucB from MucA that had been covalently bound to agarose resin (Fig. 5A). In this assay, the L-IIA lipopolysaccharide fragment and free MucA efficiently competed with resin-bound MucA for MucB binding. However, incubation of35S-MucB•MucA resin with the GYYYTVV, YVGYVTY, or GYYYT peptides resulted in no more35S-MucB release than observed in the buffer control (Fig. 5A). This result strongly suggests that the CupB5 peptides do not relieve MucB inhibition by directly competing for its binding to MucA. Binding of the L-IIA lipopolysaccharide fragment converts MucB dimers to tetramers (Limaet al., 2013). By contrast, incubation of MucB with GYYYTVV peptide resulted in no substantial change in elution during gel-filtration chromatography (Fig. S2). Fig. 5. CupB5 peptides do not compete with MucB for MucA binding but stimulate WVF-activated AlgW cleavage of MucA. (A) Release of35S-MucB from MucA-agarose following incubation with buffer, MucA (155 μM), L-IIA (20 mg/mL), or CupB5 peptides (~300 μM). For the CupB5 peptides, values are averages ± SEM (n=3). For L-IIA, the value is the average ± SEM (n=2). (B) Rates of cleavage by AlgW (0.5 μM trimer) and WVF peptide (150 μM) were measured at different concentrations of35S-MucA in the presence or absence of CupB5 peptides (300 μM). Values are averages ± SEM (n=2) and were fit to the Hill form of the Michaelis-Menten equation, rate = Vmax/(1 + (KM/[substrate])h). (C) Rates of cleavage of35S-MucA (50 μM) by AlgW (0.5 μM trimer) were assayed at difference concentrations of WVF peptide in the presence or absence of CupB5 peptides (300 μM). Values are averages ± SEM (n=2) and were fit to the equation rate = basal + Vmax/(1 + (Kact/[peptide])h). Without CupB5 peptide, h was 2.2 ± 1,Kactwas 11 ± 2 μM, and Vmaxwas 1250 ± 150 M−1s−1. With GYYYTVV peptide, h was 1.5 ± 0.8,Kactwas 18 ± 7 μM, and Vmaxwas 2490 ± 490 M−1s−1. Because CupB5 peptides did not strongly activate AlgW cleavage of MucA in the absence of the WVF peptide or release MucA from MucB, we speculated that they might act in concert with the WVF peptide to allow AlgW to bind and degrade MucA more efficiently and thus to compete better with MucB for the MucA substrate. This model predicts that MucA should be degraded at a faster rate in the presence of both the WVF and CupB5 peptides. Indeed, when we assayed the rate of cleavage of different concentrations of35S-MucA by AlgW, faster cleavage was observed when both the WVF and wild-type CupB5 peptides were present compared to only the WVF peptide or the WVF peptide and scrambled CupB5 control peptide (Fig. 5B). We also measured the rate of AlgW cleavage of a fixed concentration of MucA in the presence of increasing concentrations of WVF peptide with or without additional GYYYTVV peptide (Fig. 5C). When GYYYTVV peptide was present, the maximum rate of MucA cleavage increased almost two-fold. We conclude that the CupB5 peptides and WVF peptide act synergistically to enhance AlgW cleavage of MucA, allowing better competition with MucB. InE. coli, RseA, RseB, and DegS are homologs of MucA, MucB, and AlgW. A YYF peptide efficiently activates DegS cleavage of RseA in the absence of RseB or in the presence of both RseB and lipopolysaccharides (Walshet al., 2003;Cezairliyan and Sauer, 2007;Limaet al., 2013). The CupB5 peptides did not substantially stimulate cleavage of35S-RseA by YYF-activated DegS in the presence of RseB (Fig. S3), suggesting that they do not interact with DegS. This result is not surprising, as DegS and AlgW share only 44% sequence homology. Suppressing and enhancing alginate production If CupB5 allows AlgW to compete more efficiently with MucB for MucA binding and cleavage, then overproduction of MucB in strain PAO1-VE22 would be expected to decrease alginate production. Indeed, plasmid-mediated MucB overproduction had this effect, as did plasmid-mediated overproduction of MucA (Fig. 6A). The latter result suggests that with enough additional uncleaved MucA, AlgU is efficiently inhibited even when more MucA is degraded than usual. Even the CupB5-induced elevated rate of AlgW cleavage of MucA in this strain must be too slow to free enough AlgU to fully enhance transcription of alginate biosynthesis genes. Fig. 6. Inducing and suppressing alginate production inP. aeruginosastrains. (A) Strains overproducing CupB5 (PAO1-VE22) or MucE (PAO1-VE2) were transformed with plasmid HERD20T or variants overexpressing MucA or MucB, grown at 37°C for 24 h on PIA plates supplemented with 0.1% L-arabinose, and alginate production and colony phenotypes (M, mucoid; NM, nonmucoid) were assayed. (B) Alginate production and mucoid phenotypes were assayed in strains PAO1, PAO1-VE2 (mucEoverexpressed), PAO1mucB::tetR (mucBinactivated), and PAO1-VE22 (cupB5 overexpressed) transformed with the HERD20T plasmid vector or variants expressing HA-CupB4-H6or HA-CupB5-H6. Values are averages ± SEM (n=3). Statistical significance was determine using the Student’st-test(*P<0.05; **<0.005). We initially thought that CupB5 peptides might bind MucB and compete for binding to MucA in a manner analogous to LPS. However, neither GYYYTVV nor GYYYT peptides compete with MucA-agarose for MucB binding and saturating concentrations of these peptides only partially relieve MucB inhibitionin vitro. Moreover, unlike LPS, GYYYTVV did not convert MucB dimers into tetramers. By themselves, CupB5 peptides activate AlgW cleavagein vitrofar less well than the OMP-like WVF peptide. However, CupB5 peptides stimulate MucA cleavage by WVF-activated AlgW, suggesting that OMP-like and CupB5 peptides bind to distinct sites in AlgW but have a common effect of stabilizing the proteolytically active enzyme. The GYYYTVV sequence is conserved in CupB5 proteins from different strains ofP. aeruginosabut not in CupB5 proteins from otherPseudomonasspecies (Fig. S3), and somePseudomonasspecies have no CupB5 ortholog. Thus, CupB5 activation of AlgW is specific toP. aeruginosa. It remains to be determined ifP. aeruginosautilizes other proteins in this manner or if AlgW homologs in other bacteria are activated by more than one kind of peptide signal. Although CupB5 peptides, OMP peptides, and LPS molecules function by different mechanisms to activate AlgW or relieve MucB inhibition, the molecular logic that gives rise to all three signals is similar. For example, stresses that compromise the transport to and outer-membrane assembly of OMPs and LPS, or that slow usher-mediated CupB5 secretion, would all lead to the periplasmic accumulation of these molecules and activation of the AlgU pathway. Indeed, we found that alginate production was suppressed in strains that overproduced the CupB4 chaperone, allowing export of CupB5. Certain stresses might only activate AlgW through OMP signals, whereas others require an enhanced response via CupB5 or possibly other proteins secreted through the outer membrane. Clearly, however, the AlgU system integrates multiple signals, each reporting on potential dysfunction in outer-membrane assembly, structure, and/or secretion. Dysfunction in just one pathway should give rise to a buffered AlgU response, whereas dysfunction affecting multiple pathways would elicit a robust AlgU response. Bacteria strains, plasmids, and growth conditions Bacteria strains and plasmids used in this study are shown inTable S2.Escherichia colistrains were grown at 37°C in Lennox broth (LB) or LB agar.P. aeruginosastrains were grown at 37°C in LB,Pseudomonasisolation broth (PIB, Alpha Bioscience) or onPseudomonasisolation agar (PIA) plates (Difco). When required, the concentration of carbenicillin, tetracycline or gentamicin added to LB broth or plates was 100 μg ml−1, 20 μg ml−1, or 15 μg ml−1, respectively, and 300 μg ml−1, 150 μg ml&−1, or 200 μg ml−1when added to PIB or PIA plates, respectively. Transposon mutagenesis was carried out via biparental conjugations usingE. coliSM10 λpir carrying plasmid pFAC as the donor strain (Wong and Mekalanos, 2000) and PAO1 as the recipient strain. After incubating PAO1 andE. colicells on LB agar plates at 37°C for 6 h, bacteria were collected, re-suspended in PBS and then plated onto PIA supplemented with gentamicin (200 μg ml−1). Mucoid colonies were identified. The chromosomal DNA of mucoid mutants was isolated using the QIAamp genomic DNA Extraction kit (Qiagen, USA). Approximately, 2 μg of DNA was digested withSalIovernight at 37°C, followed by purification and self-ligation using Fast-Link DNA ligase (Epicentre, USA). The circular closed DNA was used as a template for inverse PCR using GM3OUT and GM5OUT primers (Qiuet al., 2008b). The PCR products were purified and sequenced. Finally, Southern-blot hybridization was also conducted to monitor the copy number of transposon insertions using the Gmrgene as the probe (Head and Yu, 2004). Genetic construction, transformation and conjugation All DNA cloning was performed using PCR products digested with appropriate restriction enzymes and ligated into theE. colitoPseudomonasshuttle vector pHERD20T (Qiuet al., 2008a). All constructs of pHERD20T were sequenced to verify the correct DNA sequences. DNA sequencing was carried out by the Marshall University Genomics Core Facility. The primer sequences used for PCR cloning will be provided upon request. The transformation of One Shot TOP10 (Invitrogen, USA) was performed according to the supplier’s instruction. The transfer of pHERD20T and its derivatives was performed via triparental conjugation using the helper plasmid pRK2013 (Figurski and Helinski, 1979). Protein preparation and Western blotting For extraction of total cellular protein, PeriPreps™Periplasting Kit (Epicentre, USA) was used. Bacteria were inoculated in PIB medium and incubated in shake culture for several hours, until the OD600was ~0.6. At this point 0.1% L-arabinose was added to induce protein expression. Two hours after induction, bacteria were collected for cell lysis. The protein concentration was measured using Bio-Rad Dc protein assay reagents (Bio-Rad). Equivalent proteins were mixed with 2×sample loading buffer and analyzed on 10–20% pre-cast SDS-PAGE gels (Bio-Rad). Proteins were then transferred to a PVDF membrane (GE) by electro-blotting for immunodetection. A primary antibody, rat Anti-HA (Roche, USA), was used at a dilution of 1:5000. Goat anti-rat immunoglobulin G (heavy and light chains) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Pierce, USA) diluted 1: 5000 was used as the secondary antibody. Finally, the proteins on the membrane were visualized using the Amersham ECL kit (GE, USA). P. aeruginosastrains were grown at 37°C on triplicate PIA plates for 24 h. Bacteria were collected, suspended in PBS, and the OD600was measured and adjusted to ~0.5 by addition of PBS. The suspensions were analyzed for the amount of uronic acid in comparison with a standard curve made with D-mannuronic acid lactone (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) as described (Damronet al., 2009). Purifications ofP. aeruginosaMucA, MucB and AlgW andE. coliRseA, RseB and DegS were performed as described after plasmid-mediated overexpression inE. colistrain X90(DE3) (Sohnet al., 2007;Cezairliyan and Sauer, 2009). Cultures containing 100 μg/mL ampicillin were grown to an OD600 of ~0.6, and protein expression was induced with 100 mM IPTG for two h before harvesting. Cells overexpressing MucB, AlgW, RseB or DegS were resuspended in native lysis buffer [P. aeruginosaproteins: 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8), 500 mM KCl, 20 mM imidazole;E. coliproteins: 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8), 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole] and lysed by sonication. Cells overexpressing MucA or RseA were resuspended in denaturing lysis buffer [50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8), 8 M guanidine hydrochloride (pH 8)] and allowed to lyse at room temperature for 30 min. For all preparations, lysates were cleared by centrifugation and applied to Ni-NTA columns pre-equilibrated in native lysis buffer or denaturing lysis buffer. Columns were washed with lysis buffer and proteins eluted with elution buffer [P. aeruginosaproteins: 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8), 500 mM KCl, 500 mM imidazole;E. coliproteins: 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8), 300 mM NaCl, 300 mM imidazole]. Proteins were then dialyzed overnight against storage buffer [P. aeruginosaproteins: 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 200 mM KCl, 10% glycerol;E. coliproteins: 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8), 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA] and then again against fresh buffer before being stored frozen at −80°C. Prior to dialysis and storage, MucB and RseB were chromatographed on a size-exclusion column and only fractions corresponding to the dimer were collected. To obtain radiolabeled35S-MucA,35S-RseA, or35S-MucB, cells were grown in a defined rich medium (TekNova) lacking methionine and35S-methionine was added upon induction. Purification of35S-MucA and35S-RseA then proceeded as described above for unlabeled MucA and RseA. Cells expressing35S-MucB were lysed by the addition of lysozyme and three freeze-thaw cycles, and purification then proceeded as described above. All peptides were synthesized by GenScript and purified by reverse-phase HPLC using a C18 column. Purified products were lyophilized, stored at −20°C, then resuspended in storage buffer and used immediately. The L-IIA LPS fragment was a gift from Santiago Lima (MIT) (Limaet al., 2013). Assays were performed as described (Sohnet al., 2007;Cezairliyan and Sauer, 2009). Briefly, cleavage reactions were performed at 25°C in reaction buffer [P. aeruginosaproteins: 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 200 mM KCl, 10% glycerol;E. coliproteins: 150 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8.3), 380 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 4 mM EDTA]. Reactions were initiated by the addition of protease and quenched after different times by addition of cold 10% trichloroacetic acid. Following centrifugation, acid-soluble reaction products were quantified by scintillation counting and compared to total radioactivity from control samples. Cleavage activity for peptide-activation assays and experiments involving MucB are reported as a second-order rate constant calculated by dividing the rate of substrate cleavage by the substrate and enzyme concentrations. Activity at different substrate concentrations for the Michaelis-Menten curve was calculated by dividing the rate of substrate cleavage by the enzyme concentration. Dry cyanogen-bromide activated Sepharose B4 resin (66 mg) was washed with 1 M HCl, equilibrated with coupling buffer [25 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8.3), 50 mM NaCl], and incubated with purified MucA (900 μg) for 1.5 hours. After removal of free protein, reactive groups on the resin were blocked by incubation in 0.5 M ethanolamine (pH 8.3) for 1 h. The MucA resin was washed, resuspended in coupling buffer, and stored at 4 °C. For assays, MucA resin was drained, incubated with a four-fold molar excess of35S-MucB, washed again, incubated with ligand for 30 min, added to a pre-wetted 96-well Multiscreen HTS-HV Filter Plate (Millipore) over a 96-well polypropylene receiving plate (Greiner), and centrifuged at 1500 × g for 1 min. Elution of35S-MucB was measured by scintillation counting and normalized by dividing by the total initial35S-MucB radioactivity.
