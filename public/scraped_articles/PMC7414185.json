Ca2+signaling is closely linked to the triggering of plant immune responses. We show that when the bacterial elicitor peptide flg22 is used to trigger immune responses in mutants missing tonoplast Ca2+pumps, it causes disrupted Ca2+signals that are higher in amplitude than expected from wild-type plants. Relocalization of a Ca2+pump normally found in the plasma membrane to the tonoplast rescues both the tonoplast pump knockout mutant’s immune-related phenotypes and aberrant Ca2+signaling dynamics. These observations support the notion that tonoplast-localized pumps are critical for the proper maintenance of Ca2+dynamics in innate immune responses but that any regulatory systems specific to the endogenous tonoplast pumps may not be required to support these signaling events. One of the major events of early plant immune responses is a rapid influx of Ca2+into the cytosol following pathogen recognition. Indeed, changes in cytosolic Ca2+are recognized as ubiquitous elements of cellular signaling networks and are thought to encode stimulus-specific information in their duration, amplitude, and frequency. Despite the wealth of observations showing that the bacterial elicitor peptide flg22 triggers Ca2+transients, there remain limited data defining the molecular identities of Ca2+transporters involved in shaping the cellular Ca2+dynamics during the triggering of the defense response network. However, the autoinhibited Ca2+-ATPase (ACA) pumps that act to expel Ca2+from the cytosol have been linked to these events, with knockouts in the vacuolar members of this family showing hypersensitive lesion-mimic phenotypes. We have therefore explored how the two tonoplast-localized pumps, ACA4 and ACA11, impact flg22-dependent Ca2+signaling and related defense responses. The double-knockoutaca4/11exhibited increased basal Ca2+levels and Ca2+signals of higher amplitude than wild-type plants. Both the aberrant Ca2+dynamics and associated defense-related phenotypes could be suppressed by growing theaca4/11seedlings at elevated temperatures. Relocalization of ACA8 from its normal cellular locale of the plasma membrane to the tonoplast also suppressed theaca4/11phenotypes but not when a catalytically inactive mutant was used. These observations indicate that regulation of vacuolar Ca2+sequestration is an integral component of plant immune signaling, but also that the action of tonoplast-localized Ca2+pumps does not require specific regulatory elements not found in plasma membrane-localized pumps. Plant pathogens are ubiquitous in the environment and plants have evolved sensory systems to recognize their presence and trigger appropriate defense responses. One of the best characterized of these sensing networks is through plasma membrane localized pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). These PRRs bind pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs): That is, conserved molecular signals of pathogen presence, such as bacterial flagellin or fungal chitin. Upon PAMP-binding, the PRRs trigger an immune response termed pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) that can lead to the rapid development of both local and plant-wide defense (systemic acquired resistance) (1). The best-characterized of the PRRs is the leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase flagellin-sensitive 2 (FLS2). This protein acts with a coreceptor, BAK1, and is responsible for recognizing bacterial flagellin (or minimally the flg22 peptide epitope within flagellin) (2,3) and triggers the signaling systems that lead to PTI. Induction of these local and systemic responses involves the activation of myriad cellular signaling events at sites of pathogen perception, such as protein phosphorylation cascades, production of reactive oxygen species, anion fluxes, and apoplastic alkalization (1,4–6). One of these major hallmarks of early PTI responses is a rapid influx of Ca2+into the cytosol immediately after PAMP recognition. The subsequent change in cytosolic Ca2+level is then thought to play a role in triggering downstream responses (7–9). Indeed, changes in cytosolic Ca2+are recognized as ubiquitous elements of cellular signaling networks and are thought to encode stimulus-specific information in their duration, amplitude, and frequency: Their so-called “calcium signature” (10). Calcium signatures are determined by an interplay between Ca2+permeable channels, exchangers, and pumps (11). Two cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (CNGCs 2 and 4) have emerged as likely key players in the Ca2+influx supporting the flg22-triggered signaling system under nonlimiting soil Ca2+levels (12). However, other channels are likely also involved as thecngc2/4double mutant attenuates, but does not abolish, the flg22-induced Ca2+change. Similarly, although CNGC2 and -4 are thought to mediate Ca2+influx at the plasma membrane, whether release from internal Ca2+stores plays a major role in these signaling events remains to be fully characterized. Despite this important role for channels in generating such defense-related Ca2+signals, building evidence also suggests an important role for Ca2+efflux pumps in innate immune Ca2+signaling. In particular, mutants of P2B-type ATPases, or autoinhibited calcium ATPases (ACAs) (13), have been shown to exhibit aberrant patterns of PTI (14,15). Thus, mutants in theArabidopsisplasma membrane ACAs, ACA8 and ACA10, show impaired defense and attenuated flg22-induced Ca2+signals. Conversely, disruption of the tonoplast ACAs, ACA4 and ACA11, renders plants to be constitutively defense responsive, but whether these phenotypes are related to aberrations in Ca2+signaling remains unknown (14). We report thataca4/11mutants show elevated basal Ca2+and an increased Ca2+signal in response to flg22. Elevated temperature is known to suppress defense-response phenotypes and growth at high temperatures rescued both the altered Ca2+dynamics and aberrant downstream pathogen responses. Furthermore, we report that the relocalization of a plasma membrane ACA (ACA8) to the tonoplast rescues theaca4/11phenotype. These observations imply that tonoplast-localized Ca2+pumping is integral to maintaining homeostatic Ca2+levels and for the initiation of proper PTI responses. However, because the relocalized plasma membrane pump can rescue the tonoplast knockout phenotypes, any regulatory motifs specific to the tonoplast pumps may not be required to support normal Ca2+signaling in the flg22-triggered response network. aca4/11Leaves Exhibit Elevated Baseline Ca2+Levels. Theaca4/11tonoplast ACA pump knockout shows an enhanced defense response, but its effects on Ca2+dynamics are unstudied (14). We therefore monitored cytoplasmic Ca2+dynamics inaca4/11plants expressing the ratiometric, genetically encoded, fluorescent protein-based Ca2+sensor YC-Nano65 (16). As Ca2+levels increase, the cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) signal from YC-Nano65 falls and the FRET signal from the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) partner in the sensor increases. An increasing change in the FRET:CFP ratio (∆R) therefore reflects increasing cytosolic Ca2+([Ca2+]Cyt).aca4/11mutants spontaneously form lesions around the time of inflorescence bolting, so we only imaged plants that had not yet developed lesions to mitigate potential imaging artifacts from dead cells. We obtained the mean FRET:CFP ratio values over 3 h for entire rosette leaves of Col-0 andaca4/11and observed a significant elevation in baseline [Ca2+]Cytinaca4/11plants (Fig. 1). Similarly, we tested [Ca2+]Cytvalues in intact and detached cotyledons of 10-d-old seedlings and observed a similar pattern of basal [Ca2+]Cytelevation inaca4/11(SI Appendix, Fig. S1). Such a sustained Ca2+elevation may be associated with lesion formation as the infiltration of leaves with an avirulent strain of the phytopathogenPseudomonas syringaepv. tomato DC3000 (Pst) has also been reported to elicit sustained Ca2+elevations that preceded hypersensitive lesion formation (17–19). Basal Ca2+levels are elevated inaca4/11rosette leaves. Rosette leaves from intact 20-d-old soil-grown plants expressing YC-Nano65 were imaged at 22 °C. (A) FRET:CFP values for Col-0 andaca4/11rosettes were obtained every 30 s over 3 h and averaged over this period of time. FRET:CFP values indicate that baseline Ca2+levels are significantly elevated in intactaca4/11leaves when compared to Col-0. (Scale bar, 1 cm.) (B) Mean ratio values [YC-Nano65 FRET(YFP) emission:CFP emission] for entire rosettes leaves were quantified for Col-0 andaca4/11. aca4/11plants exhibit significantly elevated Ca2+levels compared to Col-0 (n= 8; Student’sttest, ****P< 0.0001). flg22-Dependent Ca2+Signals Are Elevated inaca4/11. aca4/11plants exhibit an elevated Ca2+signal in response to flg22. (A) Time series of 20-d-old rosette leaves showing 1 µM flg22-induced FRET ratio elevation in Col-0 andaca4/11rosettes. Note the elevated Ca2+increase in theaca4/11mutant line.

The black dashed line indicates significant differences in FRET values for those time points (two-way ANOVA; Tukey’s honestly significant difference [HSD];P< 0.05, mean ± SEM,n= 10 replicates for each genotype). Single-cell calcium imaging of Col-0 andaca4/11cotyledons in response to flg22. Representative time series (20× objective) data were collected from Col-0 andaca4/11lines after flg22 treatment at time = 0 s. Images were acquired near the edge of the cotyledon close to the petiole for all samples. (A) Times-series images of cotyledon epidermal cells of Col-0 andaca4/11after flg22 treatment.

Note allaca4/11cells exhibit a similar, higher peak elevation in Ca2+(ΔR/R0) compared to Col-0. (C) Mean Ca2+response (ΔR/R0) from a 600-μm × 600-μm region of interest near the petiole of the cotyledon showing that the averaged response of this subregion of the leaf also shows the elevated aca4/11 response relative to wild-type,n> 6. Elevated Temperature Suppresses Lesion Formation and flg22-Dependent Ca2+Signals inaca4/11. One explanation of these altered response kinetics betweenaca4/11and Col-0 at altered temperatures would be that the sensitivity of the plants to flg22 had changed through alteration in FLS2 levels, rather than more directly affecting Ca2+homeostatic and signaling-related mechanisms. However, we did not detect any significant differences in FLS2 protein orFLS2transcript levels between genotypes or temperature treatments, suggesting that the differences in flg22-dependent Ca2+signaling is independent of FLS2 receptor levels and likely reflects temperature-related events downstream of receptor activation (SI Appendix, Fig. S7). Tonoplast Localization of ACA8 Rescuesaca4/11-Associated Phenotypes. We chose to relocalize ACA8, a plasma membrane pump, to the tonoplast due to its significant divergence from ACA4 and ACA11 in its N-terminal autoinhibitory domain. This is the region where much of this family of pump’s regulation has been localized (30–33) and where a large amount of its isoform-dependent amino acid sequence diversity resides (SI Appendix, Fig. S8). In order to relocalize ACA8, we deleted its C-terminal tail and replaced it with the analogous region of ACA11 (thus creating the chimeric ACA8-11C). The C terminus of ACA11 contains two sequences indicative of tonoplast localization, a dileucine (DXXXLL) and a tyrosine (YXXΦ) motif, where X is any amino acid and Φ is a bulky hydrophobic amino acid (SI Appendix, Fig. S9) (29,34). Furthermore, we created a version of the ACA8-11C chimeric pump with a point mutation in the P-loop of the core pump region (ACA8-D482A) that converted a conserved aspartate known to be important for pump activity into an alanine, effectively inactivating the pump (35). For both ACA8-11C and its D482A variant we generated versions tagged at the C terminus with mGFP5 (for localization studies). We also made ACA8-11C with a FLAG tag that we used in Ca2+imaging experiments as the mGFP5 tag interferes with the imaging of the CFP/YFP-based YC-Nano65 Ca2+sensor probe we have used. All pump variants were driven by the constitutiveAtUBQ10promoter. The C terminus of ACA11 localizes ACA8 to the tonoplast.

(B) Confocal images of protoplasts isolated from 10-d-old seedlings expressing either ACA8-11C:GFP, D482A:GFP, or g γ-TIP:CFP and stained with FM5-95. The yellow arrow on each respective merged image indicates the direction of the fluorescent intensity profiles for both FM5-95 and the fluorescent protein of each corresponding genotype. (Scale bars, 5 μm.) Ca2+-based signaling has been closely linked to PTI, with elicitors such as flg22 triggering Ca2+changes (e.g., refs.23,39) that are thought to play prominent roles in downstream signaling events (1,4–6). In this study we showed that tonoplast-localized Ca2+pumps appear to not only be modulators of Ca2+homeostasis, but play an important role in regulating both response to the PAMP flg22 and in the induction of PTI. Plasma membrane Ca2+pumps have likewise been linked to PAMP signaling, with for example, ACA8 thought to form a complex with the FLS2 receptor (15). However, knocking out these plasma membrane Ca2+efflux pumps that would be thought to play roles in limiting and eventually resetting increases in Ca2+signals, has been reported to actually attenuate PAMP-triggered Ca2+responses and downstream signaling (15). In addition, althoughaca8/10plants show elevated baseline Ca2+, they do not display spontaneous lesion formation (15). Taken together, these observations suggest a potentially complex role for the plasma membrane pumps in signal processing outside of their ability to pump out, and so normally limit, PAMP-induced cytoplasmic Ca2+signals. In contrast, we found that knockouts in the vacuolar ACAs led to elevated baseline Ca2+within the cell (Fig. 1), a larger flg22-induced Ca2+increase (Figs. 2and3), and elevated levels of downstream PTI responses (Fig. 4B). These observations are all consistent with these tonoplast pumps contributing to maintenance of low basal Ca2+levels and playing roles in limiting the magnitude of cytoplasmic Ca2+signals, signals that are themselves important mediators of PTI signaling. A Role for Temperature in Regulating Early PTI Responses. Elevated temperature is known to attenuate defense signaling (27) and as theaca4/11plants show phenotypes pointing at runaway PTI events (lesion mimicry, elevated defense responses, increased Ca2+signaling to flg22), we used this treatment to ask if the high-temperature effect suppressed both Ca2+dynamics and other defense-response phenotypes. Indeed, elevated temperature attenuated the PTI-related Ca2+dynamics inaca4/11to wild-type–like characteristics and these changes correlated with rescue of other elevated defense responses, such as defense gene induction and pathogen resistance (Fig. 4BandC). These higher temperatures affected the attenuation of flg22-dependent Ca2+signals in both Col-0 andaca4/11plants (Fig. 4E), suggesting that common temperature-dependent components of the Ca2+efflux machinery are affected in both genotypes. Although previous studies have indicated that PTI responses, including positive regulation of defense transcripts and MAPK activation, are favored at elevated temperatures (41), our experiments indicate that Ca2+signaling, a canonic PTI response, is suppressed at elevated temperature, consistent with reports that defense-response systems are compromised at higher temperatures, likely through alterations in salicylic acid-dependent pathways (29). Transporters at the Tonoplast Shape the Calcium Signature. Along with previous work onaca4/11defense and lesion phenotypes (14), our study indicates that the activity of ACAs at the tonoplast is important for PTI and normal PAMP-dependent Ca2+signaling. Using a combination of modeling and direct Ca2+measurements using aequorin-expressing plants, Lenzoni et al. (42) have shown that not only the characteristics of the rising, but also the falling phase of Ca2+transients are likely to be important for modulating subsequent defense-related gene expression. However, in our experiments, althoughaca4/11had a significantly elevated Ca2+signal in response to flg22 (Figs. 2Band3BandC), both Col-0 andaca4/11reached basal Ca2+levels at similar time points (Fig. 6C). This observation indicates that ACA4 and ACA11 are likely important for regulating the net influx of Ca2+during flg22 perception (i.e., the initial rising phase of the signal), while other efflux systems may be involved in the re-establishment of baseline Ca2+. The Ca2+/H+exchangers of the tonoplast have similarly been shown to operate in PTI, although the complex they form may act as a response element downstream of the initial perception and signaling machinery (43). The Ca2+/H+exchangers are also known to play roles in abiotic stress responses (44) and indeed, previous work has implied that the tonoplast provides a signaling hub for these classes of response. For example, in the mossPhyscomitrella patens, knockout of the tonoplast calcium pump PCA1 resulted in NaCl-dependent Ca2+transients that were higher in amplitude and of longer duration (45). Thus, it will be of interest to assess whether ACA4 and ACA11 also play roles in abiotic stress-related Ca2+signaling. We also show that relocalization of a plasma membrane Ca2+pump, ACA8, to the tonoplast rescued the phenotypes associated with theaca4/11tonoplast pump knockout. Several studies have indicated that dileucine motifs are involved in the localization of tonoplast membrane proteins (46–48), and so we have capitalized on this machinery to retarget nontonoplast proteins to the tonoplast for functional rescue experiments. Thus, although when we overexpressed native ACA8, it targeted to the plasma membrane (SI Appendix, Fig. S12), expression of this same pump engineered with the C terminus of ACA11 was targeted to the tonoplast, with little indication of a plasma membrane localized fraction (Fig. 5andSI Appendix, Fig. S10). Relocalization of ACA8 to the tonoplast sometimes led to the formation of “bulb” structures (SI Appendix, Fig. S13), which are believed to be artifacts due to the dimerization of GFP (49). However, as we used mGFP5—a monomeric form of GFP—that should not dimerize, whether these bulbs are bona fide tonoplast structures (50) potentially enriched in ACA8-11C will require future study. ACAs are typified by the presence of a calmodulin-binding N-terminal autoinhibitory domain that restricts pump activity (35,51–53) and accounts for much of the variability between ACA isoforms (SI Appendix, Fig. S8). The autoinhibitory domain can undergo posttranslational modifications that can potentially modulate the binding capacity of calmodulin or calmodulin-like (CML) proteins. For example, the autoinhibitory domain of ACA8 appears to be regulated by CML36 (32). This region can also be phosphorylated (30,31), but in general the molecular identities of the modifiers of ACA action remain undefined. Despite the differences between the N-terminal domains of ACA4, ACA11, and ACA8 (SI Appendix, Fig. S8), ACA8-11C was still able to functionally rescue theaca4/11mutant phenotypes. This observation suggests that Ca2+transport across the tonoplast by an ACA is the critical feature for this signaling system but, at the same time, that it may not require regulatory circuits specifically tailored to Ca2+pumps normally targeted to this location. The failure of the pump-dead D482A mutant of ACA8-11C to rescue theaca4/11phenotype reinforces the idea of this essential role for pumping activity. Thus, the proliferation of ACA family pumps through evolutionary time may have been necessitated to specify the localization of pumps to relevant membranes with a divergence event segregating ACAs into plasma membrane and nonplasma membrane localizations. Although specific regulatory events associated with each membrane locale may have evolved, the basic core pumping activity of these transporters appears robust enough to work in varied cellular locations. Similarly, the Ca2+homeostatic system appears flexible enough to integrate heterologous pumping activity into a system capable of supporting normal Ca2+-based signaling activities. Thus, the Ca2+signaling system of pumps and channels shows the features of resilience and compensation reminiscent of the scale-free genetic networks that characterize many other cellular regulatory systems (54). Plant Material and Growth Conditions. Col-0 andaca4-3/11-5mutantArabidopsis thalianaseeds [Col-0 ecotype;aca4-3(Salk_029620.50.70),aca11-5(SAIL_269_C07.b.1a. Lb3Fa), kindly provided by Jeff Harper, University of Nevada, Reno] were vapor-sterilized using 100 mL of 12% (wt/vol) bleach (Chlorox) and 3 mL of 37% (vol/vol) hydrochloric acid for 3 h. Seeds for confocal imaging were plated on gels of 1/2 Linsmaier and Skoog (LS) basal medium (PhytoTechnology Laboratories) containing 10 mM sucrose and 0.5% (wt/vol) Phytagel (Sigma-Aldrich), pH 5.7, poured to a 2-mm thickness onto 40 × 24-mm coverslips (Goldseal, ThermoFisher), then stratified at 4 °C for 48 h before being placed in a growth chamber (16-h light/8-h dark at 22 °C or 28 °C). Multiple independently transformed lines expressing35S::YC-Nano65,UBQ10::ACA8-GFP,UBQ10::ACA8-11Cterm-mGFP5,UBQ10::ACA8-11Cterm-FLAG,UBQ10::ACA8-D482A-11Cterm-mGFP5, orUBQ10::ACA8-D482A-11Cterm-FLAGwere obtained usingAgrobacterium-mediated transformation, as previously described (55). Plants imaged for rosette area were germinated in growth chambers set at 22 °C or 28 °C, 16-h light/8-h dark, then transplanted to soil (Propagation Mix, SunGro Horticulture) 7 to 10 d after germination and watered with deionized water. Images were obtained once a day and rosette areas were calculated using FIJI (56). Three- to 5-d-old seedlings were incubated in 1/2 LS liquid media containing 1 µM FM5-95 (ThermoFisher) for 5 min on ice. Seedlings were similarly stained with 2 µM LysoTracker Red DND-99 (ThermoFisher) but were incubated for 30 min in 1/2 LS liquid media containing dye, then washed in 1/2 LS media without dye for 3 h at room temperature prior to imaging. Images were acquired on an LSM 780 inverted confocal microscope (Zeiss) using a 40× Water, NA 0.9 objective. GFP and FM5-95 were excited with 488-nm laser, using a 488 dichroic mirror and emission at 500 to 550 nm for GFP or 600 to 700 nm for FM5-95. Lysotracker Red DND-99 was excited with a 561-nm laser (488/561 dichroic; emission 600 to 650 nm). Pearson’s and Spearman’s correlation coefficients for colocalization were calculated using the PSC Colocalization Plugin in FIJI (57). Cotyledons were detached from seedlings grown under sterile conditions on plates, as described above, for 7 to 10 d or for rosette leaves from soil grown plants, 20 d after germination. Detached leaves were placed between a thin layer of 1/2 LS + 10 mM sucrose, 0.5% (wt/vol) Phytagel and a coverslip, adaxial side down, 2 h prior to imaging. A 1-cm × 1-cm well was cut into the gel prior to imaging for the application of solutions. Imaging was performed on a Zeiss LSM 710 inverted confocal microscope with a 5×/0.16 M27 EC Plan-Neofluar or 20×/0.75 Plan-Apochromat objective. Excitation of the YC-Nano65 sensor was performed with the 458-nm laser line and emission for cpVenus and CFP were obtained at 525 to 540 nm and 460 to 505 nm, respectively. Whole-leaf imaging was performed as in Lenglet, et al. (58). Briefly, a Nikon stereomicroscope (SMZ-25) equipped with a 1× objective (P2-SHR PLAN APO, Nikon), W-VIEW image-splitting optics (Hamamatsu), and a sCMOS camera (Hamamatsu) were used to image 20-d-old rosette leaves of YC-Nano65 expressing plants every 30 s. The cpVenus signal arises from FRET from its CFP partner. As Ca2+levels rise this FRET signal increases and the CFP emission decreases. Time-series FRET data were normalized via the following equation:ΔR/Ro= (R - Ro)/Ro, whereRis the ratio of cpVenus emission (FRET):CFP emission andRois the average baseline value of this “FRET ratio” prior to flg22 treatment. FRET ratio data were analyzed using the image calculator tool in FIJI (56) using a region of interest encompassing the entire leaf or cotyledon. Ratiometric Ca2+imaging for whole rosette leaves was performed with a motorized stereomicroscope equipped with image-splitting optics, as previously described (58). The total RNA for all samples was isolated using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) and any contaminating genomic DNA was degraded with TURBO DNase kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was diluted to 10 ng/μL and first-strand cDNA and qPCR were performed using Luna Universal One-Step RT-qPCR master mix (New England Biolabs) in a 20-µL reaction. qPCR analysis was performed on a 7500 Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) using theUBQ10(At4G05320) gene fromA. thalianaas an internal reference (29). qPCR was performed in a 96-well optical PCR plate (ABgene) using the following parameters: 1 cycle of 10 min at 95 °C,and 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C, 15 s at 58 °C and 15 s at 65 °C, and 1 cycle of dissociation from 58 to 95 °C with 1 ° temperature increments. The qPCR primers used in this study are presented inSI Appendix, Table S1. ACA8-11Cterm Chimeric Pump Cloning. TheAtUBQ10(636bp upstream ATG) promoter was amplified fromA. thalianagDNA using primers 532/533 (SI Appendix, Table S2) that introduced 5′KpnI/3′NcoI sites for subcloning into pCAMBIA1302. A C-terminal truncated version ofACA8(ACA8ΔC) was cloned from cDNA using oligos 525/526 (SI Appendix, Table S2) to generate a 5′XbaI and a 3′ SalI sites for subcloning intoUBQ10pro::mGFP5-pCAMBIA1302.UBQ10::ACA8ΔC_1302 was linearized with SalI and gBlock5 (Integrated DNA Technologies) (SI Appendix, Table S2) was introduced using isothermal assembly (NEBuilder HiFi Assembly Kit; New England Biolabs) to produceUBQ10::ACA8-11C-mGFP5-1302. The D482A point mutant was generated by amplifyingACA8-11Cin two halves (D482A_1 and D482A_2) with primers 633/634 and 635/636, then recombining intoUBQ10pro::mGFP5-pCAMBIA1302 digested with XbaI and SalI via isothermal assembly. ACA8-11Csequence was amplified fromUBQ10::ACA8-11C_1302 with oligos 571/572 (SI Appendix, Table S2) to add a C-terminal FLAG tag and to produce overlaps for isothermal assembly intoUBQ10pro::pCAMBIA1300 digested with XbaI/BamHI. Ten-day-old seedlings were flood-inoculated essentially as in Ishiga et al. (59). Seedlings were grown in 12-well plates containing 1/2 LS salts and 0.5% (wt/vol) Phytagel solid media. On the day of infection,PstDC3000 (pVSP61) inoculum was suspended in sterile water with 0.025% (vol/vol) Silwet L-77 (Lehle Seeds) to an OD595nm= 0.01 (∼8.0 × 106CFU/mL of bacteria) and 3 mL of inoculum was added to each well for 3 min, decanted, and tissue harvested from 5 to 10 seedlings per biological replicate at 1 and 3 DPI. After harvesting, tissue fresh weight was measured, and the samples were surface-sterilized with 5% (vol/vol) H2O2for 5 min and rinsed three times with sterile water. Tissue was placed in 1.5-mL microfuge tubes and macerated in sterile water for 5 min in a 1600 miniG (Spex SamplePrep) set at 1,000 strokes per minute. Macerated tissue was serially diluted in sterile water and spread onto LB plates containing 25 µM rifampicin. Colonies per plate were counted after incubating at 28 °C for 48 h. Protoplasts were isolated from 10-d-old seedling shoot tissue essentially as in Zhai et al. (60). Confocal imaging of protoplasts was performed with identical settings as described for mGFP5 and FM5-95. Microsomal Fraction Preparation and Immunoblot Analysis. Microsomal preparations and Western blots were performed as previously described (61). Briefly, 10-d-old seedlings were homogenized in extraction buffer (250 mM Sorbitol, 50 mM Hepes-BTP, 25 mM ascorbic acid, 1 mM DTT, 6 mM EGTA 1.2% [wt/vol] Polyvinylpyrrolidone-40 and Roche cOmplete protease inhibitor mixture [Sigma-Aldrich], pH 7.4). The homogenate was filtered with cheesecloth and centrifuged at 10,000 ×gfor 15 min, the supernatant recovered and then centrifuged at 60,000 ×gfor 30 min to pellet the microsomal fraction. Microsomes were resuspended in extraction buffer and protein concentration measured with BCA Reagent (ThermoFisher) to ensure equal loading for SDS/PAGE. After transfer of protein to nitrocellulose, blots were incubated with rabbit polyclonal primary antibodies for anti-H+-PPase (52) and anti-FLS2 (Agrisera) and then probed with horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibody and developed via chemiluminescence. Sequence alignment and tree construction was based on either the whole protein sequence or N-terminal amino acid domains of theA. thalianaACAs with AtECA3 as an outgroup. Neighbor-joining trees were constructed using Mega6 (62) with 1,000 bootstraps and a Poisson model. We thank Jeff Harper for theUBQ10::ACA8-GFPconstruct andaca4/11seed.
