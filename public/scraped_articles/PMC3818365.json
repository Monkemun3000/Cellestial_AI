(fb@msu.edu) Cells operate a signaling network termed unfolded protein response (UPR) to monitor protein-folding capacity in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). IRE1 is an ER transmembrane sensor that activates UPR to maintain ER and cellular function. While mammalian IRE1 promotes cell survive, it can initiate apoptosis via decay of anti-apoptotic microRNAs. Convergent and divergent IRE1 characteristics between plants and animals underscore its significance in cellular homeostasis. This review provides an updated scenario of IRE1 signaling model, discusses emerging IRE1 sensing mechanisms, compares IRE1 features among species, and outlines exciting future directions in UPR research. ER stress and unfolded protein response The IRE1 arm is conserved in eukaryotes. IRE1 unconventionally splices bZIP transcription factors,Xbp-1, bZIP60, andHac1mRNA in mammals, plants, and yeast respectively. The spliced bZIP transcription factor enters into the nucleus to regulate UPR target genes. In addition, two distinct arms mediated by PERK and ATF6 regulate mammalian UPR. ATF6 is an ER transmembrane transcription factor. ER stress triggers the relocation of ATF6 from the ER to the Golgi apparatus where it is undergone proteolytic cleavage. Subsequently, the transcription factor domain of ATF6 enters into the nucleus to modulate transcription of UPR target genes. Two functional homologues of ATF6, bZIP17 and bZIP28, exist in plants. PERK, an ER transmembrane protein kinase is identified only in animals. Upon ER stress, PERK phosphorylates eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (elF2α), which leads to a transient inhibition of general protein translation and selective translation of the transcription factor ATF4. Under irremediable ER stress, PERK-elF2α-ATF4-CHOP and IRE1-JNK initiate apoptosis in mammals. Moreover, the beta subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein complex, AGB1, is essential for the plant UPR. Although the G protein complex is conserved in eukaryotes, its significance in UPR is unclear in other eukaryotic organisms. Color code: blue - eukaryotes; black - mammals; green - plants; red - yeast. This review presents the latest advances and viewpoints on IRE1-dependent UPR research. We focus on the recent groundbreaking discoveries that define IRE1 as a master regulator in cell fate determination under ER stress. IRE1 was long considered as a positive regulator in cell survival. Thus, the repression of IRE1 was believed to potentiate apoptosis. The recent identification of novel IRE1 regulatory events reveals that IRE1 signaling is persistent during ER stress. Namely, IRE1 can no longer be considered simply as a driving force for cell survival, but rather as an administrator/executor of cell fate determination under ER stress. Through presentation of the recent evidence establishing that IRE1 triggers diverse signaling, we delineate current IRE1-signaling models. It has also become clear that IRE1 monitors cellular homeostasis beyond the protein-folding status in the ER; therefore, the functional relevance of the UPR within physiological processes will be discussed. Finally, we will compare convergent and divergent features of IRE1 between plants and mammals to provide an integrated view of IRE1 in multicellular eukaryotes. IRE1 signaling in cell fate determination Revised model of IRE1α signaling network in mammals Mammalian IRE1α is repressed through a physical interaction with BiP when demand and capacity of protein folding is balanced in the ER. A dissociation of IRE1α from BiP due to an elevated level of unfolded protein in the ER leads to activation of IRE1α. The IRE1α activating processes include its auto-phosphorylation, conformational change, and higher order assembly. IRE1α directs cell fate decision through unconventional splicing and Regulated IRE1-Dependent Decay (RIDD). To prevent increasing demand of ER protein folding, IRE1α conducts RIDD to degrade the transcripts of ER-translocating proteins. In parallel, IRE1α unconventionally splices the transcript ofXbp-1transcription factor. The spliced XBP-1 enters into the nucleus to transcriptionally reprogram UPR target genes, including ER chaperones. Under irremediable ER stress, IRE1α ceases to spliceXbp-1mRNA. Instead, IRE1α operates RIDD on selective UPR target genes including BiP to enhance the ER stress intensity. Once the ER stress intensity reaches its threshold, IRE1α represses anti-Casp2microRNA, miR-17, miR-34a, miR-96, and miR-125b through RIDD. IRE1α-mediated degradation of anti-Casp2microRNAs leads to activation of apoptotic initiatorCasp2and subsequently triggers the mitochondrion-dependent apoptosis. The UPR signaling aimed for cell survival is considered an adaptive response during ER stress. Under irremediable ER stress, UPR represses the adaptive response and triggers an apoptotic response. IRE1α and PERK are two ER stress sensors that decrease ER protein folding demand through mRNA decay and translational inhibition, respectively. Both PERK and IRE1α signaling appear to persist throughout ER stress. IRE1α differentially triggers diverse UPR according to need. In the adaptive phase, to increase protein folding capcity, IRE1α-mediatedXbp-1mRNA splicing is activated for transcriptional regulation of UPR target genes. In a transition phase between the adaptive and apoptotic responses, the signaling mediated by IRE1α-Xbp-1is attenuated. In parallel, IRE1α incrases ER stress intensity through mRNA decay of selective UPR target genes including ER chaperones. During the apoptotic phase, IRE1α-Casp2signaling is activated to initate cell death. Is mammalian IRE1α the only major trigger of ER stress-induced apoptosis? IRE1α is necessary and sufficient to trigger apoptosis while PERK and ATF6 are dispensable in the apoptosis activation [49]. Nonetheless, it cannot be excluded that distinct ER stress sensors may serve as major executioners of cell death in a context-specific manner. Using chemical genetic tools, the regulatory roles of the phosphor-transfer and RNase activity of IRE1α in UPR can be examined separately. The phosphor-transfer function is dispensable forXbp-1mRNA splicing and upregulation of CASP2 expression; however, it is required for the subsequent CASP2 cleavage and apoptosis activation, indicating that IRE1α phosphor-transfer function is essential for cell fate switch during ER stress [49,50]. Notably, the phosphor-transfer function is mostly studied through anin vitroconditional IRE1α induction that mimics ER stress. While this experimental system is valuable to distinguish phosphor-transfer and RNase function of IRE1α, it is important to note that ATF6 and PERK are not activated through ER stress. A potentially compromised crosstalk among UPR arms raises a possibility that the IRE1α induction system might not completely resemble a genuinely biological scenario of ER stress. Hence, careful data interpretation from the conditional induction system and integration ofin vivoanalyses are necessary to determine whetherIRE1αis the master trigger in ER stress-induced apoptosis. The substrate specificity of mammalian IRE1α Plant IRE1 in ER stress response and cell fate determination Interestingly, mutations of IRE1 in plants and mammals lead to opposite effects in ER stress-induced cell death phenotypes [17,18,32].Ire1α−/−mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) exhibit a greater survival rate thanIre1α+/+MEFs under ER stress, supporting that mammalian IRE1 is an apoptosis executioner. Contrarily,Arabidopsis ire1double mutants display compromised ER stress tolerance, instead of a greater survival rate [17,18]. Consistently, DNA fragmentation and ion leakage are enhanced in theArabidopsis ire1double mutant during ER stress [32], suggesting that plant IRE1 might not function as an apoptosis executioner like its mammalian counterpart. Nevertheless, it cannot be excluded that the differences are related to dissimilar experimental settings: mammalian UPR research is mostly conducted in cell culture, while intact organisms are used in plant UPR studies. Moreover, except potential roles in protein loading reduction under ER stress [32], biological significance of the plant RIDD in cell fate determination is unknown. Further experimental validation will reveal whether the plant RIDD could process multiple substrates to control cell fate decisions similar to that seen in mammals. Shared components of UPRosome and apoptosis ER stress-sensing mechanisms are intensively studied in yeast and animals [77]. The ER stress sensors are silent through physical association with BiP, the most abundant ER-resident chaperone. Dissociation with BiP or interaction with unfolded proteins is the major trigger of IRE1 activation. Yeast IRE1 is activated through association with unfolded proteins rather than disassociation with BiP [78]; however, the physical interaction of BiP is a fine-tuning mechanism to ensure that yeast IRE1 is appropriately activated [79]. Unlike yeast IRE1, the activation mechanisms of mammalian IRE1α rely on its dissociation of BiP as opposed to a direct interaction with unfolded proteins [80]. The differences in activation mechanisms between yeast and mammalian IRE1α can be partially explained by the dissimilarity in protein structure within the sensor domain [15]. Surprisingly, a recent study revealed that mammalian IRE1β tends to interact with unfolded proteins like yeast IRE1 and it is unable to associate with BiP [81]. Accordingly, it is possible that, like yeast IRE1, binding of unfolded proteins is the primary trigger of mammalian IRE1β activation. Despite intense studies in mammals and yeast, the plant IRE1 sensing mechanisms are completely undefined. Further structural and functional analyses in plant IRE1 will be instrumental to reveal ER stress sensing mechanisms in plants. Cell-type specific sensing mechanisms: the role of mammalian IRE1β How the cellular homeostasis is maintained in a cell-type specific manner is a fundamental question of cell biology. It has been recently shown that IRE1β is essential for UPR specifically in goblet cells [46]. In goblet cells, IRE1β is dispensable forXbp-1splicing and BiP induction. Instead, IRE1β mutation leads to enhance ER stress intensity evidenced by higher level ofXbp-1splicing and BiP induction. Moreover, IRE1β−/− mice display a distended ER phenotype potentially due to over accumulation of Mucin2 (MUC2), the most prominent protein secreted from goblet cells. This suggests that IRE1β controls MUC2 expression in goblet cells. Thus, IRE1β mutation leads to MUC2 overload in the ER and in turns trigger ER stress [46]. RIDD was proposed to be the mechanism underlying IRE1β regulation on MUC2 level in goblet cells [46]. The cell-type-specific target of IRE1β provides a molecular explanation as to how the UPR maintains a dynamic and specific secretory ability in multicellular organisms. Consistent with the notion that unfolded proteins trigger IRE1β activation, IRE1β might physically interact with specific types of unfolded protein. In the case of goblet cells, IRE1β might specifically monitor the MUC2 level in the ER and adjusts its loading into the ER through RIDD. Based on this scenario, the mammalian ER stress sensors might distinguish the type of unfolded proteins accumulated in the ER and trigger differential UPR signaling. More specifically, if the unfolded proteins are dispensable for cell survival, ER stress sensors could repress the expression of unfolded proteins through RNA decay or translational repression. Conversely, if unfolded proteins are essential for cellular function, the UPR might preferentially augment the expression of chaperones to recover the production of unfolded proteins. While the ER stress duration and intensity are considered major factors in the apoptosis threshold, the type of misfolded protein might be also critical for determination of UPR signaling outputs. Sensing mechanisms beyond protein-folding homeostasis Emerging evidence shows that IRE1 monitors cellular homeostasis beyond sensing unfolded protein accumulation. For instance, CRY1/CRY2-mediated circadian rhythm regulates IRE1α activity in the liver [82], suggesting that IRE1α coordinates ER function to cope with circadian-related physiological processes. These observations provide a link between the IRE1α-dependent UPR, circadian regulation, and liver metabolic processes. More importantly, because circadian rhythm has a substantial influence on UPR activation, time course studies of the UPR will require diligent experimental design and appropriate controls to avoid biases. Recently, lipid homeostasis is proven to impact the UPR activation through an unconventional sensing mechanism as the unfolded-protein-sensing domain of IRE1α and PERK is dispensable for lipid-dependent UPR activation [83]. All together, these observations support that the UPR perceives physiological and cellular signaling beyond ER protein folding homeostasis. Although it is unclear whether plant IRE1 senses signaling beyond protein-folding capacity, anArabidopsis ire1double mutant displaying a root-specific phenotype under unstressed conditions hints that plant IRE1 also integrates physiological signals to maintain specific secretory activity [17]; however, this hypothesis is still awaiting experimental validation. Significant progress on defining IRE1 mechanisms has been achieved. We now know that IRE1 activities are coordinated at a systemic level to cope with dynamic secretion activity. Whilein vitroexperimental systems and conditional IRE1 induction approaches reveal groundbreaking discoveries in the basic UPR knowledge [49,50,84-87], we are still far from a comprehensive understanding of UPR in intact organisms. The lethality of the mammalian IRE1α mutant represents a challenge to gaining insights into the IRE1 functionin vivo. In contrast, the viability of plant IRE1 mutants enablesin vivoanalyses to reveal its roles in organ growth, pathogen defense, and abiotic stress responses [17,33,88,89]. Moreover, with the ease of building high order plant mutants,in vivophenotypic analyses show thatArabidopsisIRE1 and a conserved component of the G protein complex display a synergistic effect in both plant UPR activation and growth regulation. The study underscores that the UPR network can be built in intact organisms using plants as a model system [17]. With more systematic and quantitative studies of UPRin vivo, there are certainly significant findings ahead that will decipher the dynamic UPR maps close to a genuinely physiological scenario. IRE1α degrades anti-Casp2microRNA to initiate cell death. The phosphor-transfer function of IRE1α is essential for cell fate determination. IRE1 perceives developmental cues and protein folding homeostasis distinctly. Alterations of IRE1α substrate specificity determine cell fates.
