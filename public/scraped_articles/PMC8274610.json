Willey, Department of Radiation Oncology, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC 27157,jwilley@wakehealth.edu, 336-713-7637 While the HLU model remains the gold-standard for ground-based microgravity research, more recently developed models exist that permit investigating gravity as a continuum, using PWB via quadrupedal unloading in both mice45and rats46–49. The PWB model was principally designed to measure the dose-response relationship between degree of mechanical loading/weight-bearing and the musculoskeletal response and, thus far, studies have demonstrated a clear dose-dependent response but failed to detect the existence of a safe gravity threshold to minimize musculoskeletal deconditioning50–52. The rat PWB model uses of a pelvic harness in lieu of a traditional tail suspension, with limited obstruction of blood flow or creating a cephalic fluid shift as observed from existing studies53, and represents an environment to assess new countermeasures, both therapeutic54and diagnostic55 Space Radiation Environment and Dose Estimates: Space explorers outside of low-Earth Orbit (LEO) will be exposed to separate sources of ionizing radiation, energetic protons associated with a Solar Particle Event (SPE) and Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR)56,57. NASA is currently planning for a sustainable presence on the lunar surface and exploration class missions to Mars, far away from the protection of Earth’s magnetic field. The nature of the radiation exposures that astronauts encounter will likely change to include higher GCR and possible SPE exposures57. GCR nuclei originate outside our solar system and are high-LET (linear energy transfer), ions with enough energy to easily pass through typical spacecraft with minimal energy loss58. The considerable ionization power of GCR ions makes them the primary antagonist for possible late effects to multiple physiologic systems. During spaceflight in interplanetary space, every cell nucleus will be traversed by a hydrogen ion or delta ray every few days, and by the heavier GCR ion every few months59,60. Despite their relatively low frequency, the heavy ions contribute a significant amount to the GCR dose that astronauts will incur outside of LEO. Thicker shielding could provide protection but is limited by the capabilities of spacecraft launch systems. In fact, studies have shown that even if the amount of, e.g., aluminum, shielding is increased, there will not be a significant reduction of the intra-vehicular radiation dose57,60,61. Astronauts currently on the International Space Station (ISS) are exposed to on average about 1 mSv/day, and even have emergency plans to shield themselves with water bags should an SPE occur. As we travel further outside of LEO, however, it is expected that this daily dose will increase by a factor of 2–3 with limited additional protective measures for SPEs due to spacecraft design and consumables57,62,63. Combined Radiation and Reduced Weight-Bearing Overview: As astronauts will face multiple hazards simultaneously during long duration missions outside of LEO, it is necessary to test the individual and combined effects of these hazards in order to best determine health risk and develop countermeasures. To date, several ground-based rodent studies have combined HLU with radiation exposure to assess combined biologic effects71–73. As detailed herein, while the reduced weight-bearing model is generally HLU (with some PWB), radiation sources vary greatly (primarily photon exposures, with some proton and a few high-Z high-energy ions (HZE) exposures at NASA Space Radiation laboratory (NSRL)). Of note, the majority of studies have performed a period of HLU followed by radiation exposure or initiate the study with radiation exposure and then enroll rodents into HLU35,71–78. A few studies examine outcomes after simultaneously delivering radiation with HLU29,31,72,73,79–84. For these, rodents are irradiated in the beamline at the NSRL, or at other facilities with low-dose rate gamma rays or photons. Bone Loss in Microgravity and Reduced Weight-Bearing: Spaceflight environmental conditions, particularly microgravity and low-dose radiation, represent a risk to astronaut bone health. In the absence of mitigation strategies, spaceflight can lead to decrements in bone mass and strength85. Crew members returning from a 4–6 month mission on the ISS had reduced areal bone mineral density (aBMD) of the hip and spine. The rate of bone loss was found to be site-specific, with a 1.4–1.5% and 0.9% decrease in aBMD of the hip and spine respectively per month in the ISS. In the hip, the rate of loss was higher in cancellous bone (2.2–2.7%/month) compared to cortical bone (0.4–0.5%/month)86. In contrast, trabecular vBMD and mass decreased by 14.4–16.5 % throughout the mission duration87. Bone strength in the proximal femur also was reduced as determined by finite element modeling for stance and fall loading21. These decrements in skeletal structure and strength may increase the risk of fractures, which in turn can be catastrophic to future long duration spaceflight missions where there will be operational constraints on medical care and equipment. Space Radiation-induced Bone Damage: Impact of Combined Exposure of Space Radiation and Simulated Microgravity on Bone Structure and Function: The long-term consequences of combined microgravity and radiation on skeletal health is unclear given that most investigations have focused on immediate time points (e.g. assessment after unloading). However, there is evidence that combined exposure to HLU and HZE (0.5 Gy) can negatively impact skeletal recovery after a period of unloading. In one such study84, animals that received an acute dose of 0.5 Gy56Fe within a 14-day period of HLU displayed persistent deficits in vertebral trabecular morphology (structural model index, SMI) after a 28-day period of re-ambulation. However, cancellous BV/TV of vertebra of these animals were comparable to untreated controls after the same time period. Humans living in space experience circadian misalignment103. The interaction of the circadian clock with microgravity and space radiation has not been well examined with alterations in bone as an outcome. One investigation exposed rats to an acute, high dose of radiation (4 Gy137Cs), with ultradian cycles (45 min light/45 min dark), HLU or all factors combined. Ultradian cycles were sufficient to induce decrements in bone biomechanical properties but did not lead to bone loss. In addition, ultraradian rhythms did not worsen the negative effects of HLU and radiation on bone structure and strength. Additional and Future Considerations: Although much has been achieved in understanding the effects of spaceflight on bone health, follow-up studies are needed to validate the abovementioned findings using improved radiation exposure paradigms such as the recently developed multi-ion GCR simulation102. The use of animals that better match the age of mission crew when performing spaceflight simulation studies will facilitate translation of rodent data to humans in space. In addition, standardization of methodologies and caging designs for conducting HLU and partial weight-bearing studies also are important to allow for comparison and interpretation of findings across studies and research groups. More mechanistic investigations also are needed to understand the molecular underpinnings of the skeletal response to combined spaceflight factors. Bioinformatics approaches that allow for the assessment of global changes at the genome, transcriptome and proteome levels are particularly useful in identifying novel pathways that underlie the skeletal response to spaceflight. To date, omics data from skeletal tissue is rare. Of the two traditionally mechanosensitive tissues, muscle vastly outnumbers bone or bone cell transcriptomic datasets found on the NASA GeneLab database. Increasing the availability of bone omics datasets will facilitate improved understanding of skeletal signaling in response to spaceflight. Initiatives to study bone health in space have predominantly focused on how spaceflight negatively impacts skeletal structure and biomechanical properties with the overarching goal of understanding how they contribute to fracture risk. While it is important to address remaining knowledge gaps on fracture risk in follow-up studies, investigations by the space research community also need to broaden to reflect our growing understanding of skeletal function. Beyond providing structural support, the skeleton is an endocrine organ that can crosstalk with other tissues to maintain health and homeostasis. A number of studies demonstrate the ability of bone to function as an endocrine organ (reviewed in104–106to regulate a variety of physiological processes including glucose metabolism107–109, appetite suppression110, cognition and behavior111,112. The organism’s ability to coordinate the function of multiple tissues via bone-derived factors is essential to keep up with the demands of daily living. For example, bone-derived lipocalin-2 (LCN2) regulates glucose homeostasis via endocrine action on major metabolic organs, and also can cross the blood-brain barrier to control appetite via its binding to the melanocortin receptor (MC4R) in the hypothalamus110. In addition, LCN2 can exert pro-inflammatory actions on a variety of cell types including vascular cells113. Osteocalcin (OCN), another bone-derived hormone can modulate cognition and anxiety-like behavior111,112. Mice heterozygous for an OCN null allele showed deficits in cognition while administration of OCN improved memory and decreased anxiety-like behaviors112. In addition, OCN has been shown to mediate aspects of the acute stress response. In the presence of stressors, it is thought that OCN participates in signaling to inhibit the parasympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system to allow the sympathetic pathway to predominate, in turn promoting flight or fight responses114. The biological processes regulated by these bone-derived hormones are critical for human health and performance in space missions. Hence, it is important to begin to address whether combined spaceflight factors can perturb signaling mediated by bone-derived hormones. More studies also are needed to understand the role of bone crosstalk with other organs in mediating the physiological changes attributed to spaceflight. There has been an increase in the incidence of the ocular problem reported in astronauts during and after space shuttle missions or orbits aboard ISS3. As previously noted, this syndrome, known as spaceflight associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS), is characterized by pathophysiology symptoms including optic disc edema, globe flattening, choroidal and retinal folds, hyperopic refractive error shifts, and nerve fiber layer infarcts (i.e., cotton wool spots)115–117. In the last decade, over 30% of astronauts flying long-duration ISS missions have presented with one or more of these ocular disturbances118. Most recently, the NASA twin study found variations in choroidal and total retinal thickness, which was suggestive of retinal edema and choroidal folds in the twin exposed to spaceflight119. There is concern that degradation of visual function as a result of space flight may compromise both mission goals and long-term quality of life after space travel. Ocular damage and retinal degeneration can be promoted by many factors including aging, ischemia, fluctuation in oxygen tension, oxidative stress, and increased intraocular pressure120. Visual disturbances associated with space travel may be due to exposure from altered gravitation changes and ionizing radiation116,120–122. Although some ocular changes experienced by astronauts have been measured and evaluated117,118, validation was difficult due to the limited subject cohort size and test constraints on ISS. Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms of these ocular disturbance and factors contributing to the development of damage are currently unclear. Comprehensive ground-based rodent study models to simulate space condition including low-dose ionizing radiation and microgravity is warranted to determine the impact of the space environment on ocular structure and function. Microgravity-induced Ocular Damage: Microgravity induces a cephalic shift in body fluids, an increase in cephalad shifting of body fluids, and alterations in tissue perfusion121,123,124. Increasingly, evidence suggests that both actual microgravity encountered by astronauts in space, as well as modeled microgravity on Earth, have been shown to induce many deleterious physiological effects including changes in ocular structure and function125,126. After long-duration spaceflight, morphological changes in the optic nerve and surrounding tissues have been reported127. One study showed that even in transient microgravity conditions, as produced by parabolic flight, changes in retinal vasculature occur117. Microgravity may also induce an increase in intraocular pressure (IOP)128. A more recent study reports that in astronauts, there is an acute increase in IOP upon entering weightlessness, but that it normalizes to ground-based levels after a few days of flight118. Despite reported observations, cellular mechanisms of microgravity in inducing the unique physiological and pathological ocular responses have not yet been well-understood. Moreover, head-down tilt (HDT) during bed rest as a ground-based, human analog for microgravity has not confirmed some of SANS findings in astronauts129. Space Radiation-induced Ocular Damage: The adverse effects of radiation on the retina130–133and retinal vasculature132,134have been reported by multiple investigators who have documented structural, histopathological, and functional alterations in the affected retina after irradiation exposure. Despite reported studies, most of the animal and clinical investigations from which the current knowledge of radiation-induced ocular injury were obtained, are from relatively high doses of photon radiation. More recently, some ground-based studies have been conducted in rodent models to investigate low-dose space radiation-induced changes of ocular structure and function. Studies show dose-dependent increases in apoptosis in the retina following space radiation exposure. Data revealed that exposure to proton radiation-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in the retina at a dose as low as 0.5Gy124. Analysis of the microvasculature in the rat retina showed a time- and dose-dependent, progressive loss of endothelial cells and microvessel length over for two years after proton irradiation135. Low doses of16O ions also elicited apoptosis in the mouse retinal endothelial cells with the most robust changes observed after 0.1 Gy exposure compared to controls136. Impact of Combined Exposure of Space Radiation and Simulated Microgravity on Ocular Structure and Function: One of the main concerns for long-term deep manned space missions are health risks associated with combined exposure to microgravity environment and low-dose/low-dose-rate (LDR) radiation above levels normally found on earth due to GCRs. It is an important contribution for risk assessment to determine whether the low dose radiation response is modulated by simulated microgravity. The study design using a ground-based animal model to assess the biological effects of the spaceflight condition, combining space-like radiation exposure and microgravity is a more accurate model to simulate environmental stressors inherent to the spaceflight environment, providing a more actual risk assessment for astronauts. To our knowledge, ground studies to examine the impact of the simulated space flight conditions and underlying mechanism(s) of potential interaction on retinal structure and functional damage are very limited. In one study, mice were HLU for 7 days, then whole-body irradiated with protons at 0.5 Gy, followed by HLU for an additional 7 days. The data showed SPE-like exposures of proton irradiation alone or combined with simulated microgravity has a significant impact on retinal endothelial cell survival71. Additional and Future Considerations: As noted earlier, factors and their interactions that contribute to detrimental ophthalmic changes to the spaceflight environment are not well-investigated. More studies are needed to expose animals to microgravity simulation and low-dose space radiation simultaneously over at least 4 weeks which simulate the duration of the ISS mission. This will allow the data to be extrapolated more accurately to estimate potential risks to astronauts in the space flight environment. To simulate key aspects of space radiation exposures, further rodent study designs should consider exposing animals to both the charged particle composition of the radiation field and its low dose rate for ocular response measurements. The observation periods for the study especially for degenerative tissues need to be extended for a longer time after radiation/unloading exposure to characterize the readaptation and chronic deficits. One of the complications associated with determining the response of stress insults is the latency between exposure and the expression of injury (e.g., cell loss or dysfunction). In order to obtain accurate data for the development and progression of the injury response, it is necessary to quantify changes over a long period. The most profound physiological response and adaptation to the microgravity environment is the redistribution of fluid121. The mechanisms by which fluid shift in the spacecraft environment that could affect ocular function were less studied. Dedicated studies are needed to identify models to address this important question regarding the impact of the fluid shift on ocular structure, physiology, and visual function. Further studies are also needed to specifically assess ocular perfusion pressure and ocular hemodynamics in appropriate animal models. Electrophysiological assessment using electroretinogram (ERG) or other functional endpoints will be helpful to determine retina functional changes related to observed structural alteration. To expand our knowledge about the effects of spaceflight condition on the eyes and possible mechanisms associated with these changes, integrated omics profiling technologies such as genomics, proteomics and metabolomics are beneficial to determine sets of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), differentially expressed proteins, metabolomic/lipidomic signatures and the pathways that lead to pathological and possible degenerative changes. Recently, RNA sequencing from a spaceflight study detected 600 DEGs in murine spaceflight retinas, which were enriched for genes related to visual perception, the phototransduction pathway, and numerous retina and photoreceptor phenotype categories141. Delineating differential gene and protein expression and their relationship to overall pathophysiological and functional changes in the ocular tissue will provide a basis for the discovery and development of biomarkers and pathways for neurovascular changes in response to spaceflight condition. Herein, using the “omics”-based molecular phenotyping approach for characterizing biosignatures associated with low-dose space radiation, simulated microgravity, and other space environmental stressors will help a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms responsible for the ocular structural and pathophysiological changes. 4. CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM (CNS) RESPONSE Importance of CNS Functionality to Mission Success: Any deterioration in the ability of the astronauts to perceive or respond to changes in their situation could have disastrous consequences, as could changes in the mental health of the astronauts. The ability of astronauts to successfully complete a deep space mission, such as the ones planned for Mars, will thus be highly dependent upon a fully functional CNS. Not surprisingly, NASA has devoted considerable efforts to establishing the impact of social isolation, stress, sleep disturbances/loss and microgravity on various aspects of astronaut performance (cognition, sensorimotor response, social interaction, sleep) both during space flight and in rodent ground-based analogs. In many cases there are well established procedures and interventions to detect and mitigate these stressor related issues. However, there remains a high degree of uncertainty about the impact that exposure to space radiation will have on the cognitive and psychological capabilities of astronauts. Microgravity Effects on the CNS: Microgravity is also a major stressor on the CNS, inducing changes in the structure of the brain (rotation of the cerebral aqueduct, changes in ventricular volume, and narrowing of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) spaces at the vertex142, and a cephalic fluid shift. It also produces significant effects on the brain, particularly in cerebellar, sensorimotor, and vestibular brain regions (Reviewed in143). Brain activity may also change in response to the need for increased processing required for postural stabilization, and integration of conflicting vestibular information in the microgravity environment144. Despite all these changes, the evidence that prolonged microgravity leads to a permanent loss of cognitive function is sparse. Astronauts report a “Space fog” for 1–2 days into a mission, but this typically resolves. However, at the cellular level, simulated145microgravity result in persistent changes in the mitochondrial function and lipid metabolism of human oligodendrocytes. Oligodendrocytes are essential for providing metabolic support to neurons, rapidly transferring (through cytoplasmic “myelinic” channels and monocarboxylate transporters) short-carbon-chain energy metabolites like pyruvate and lactate to neurons146. Such microgravity induced metabolic perturbations are likely to be deleterious to neuronal function in their own right, but will likely exacerbate changes in neuronal functionality with combined exposure to other spaceflight environmental hazards, such as radiation. Space Radiation alters Neurophysiology and Neurocognitive Performance: There is an ever-growing body of evidence from ground-based rodent studies that radiation exposure impairs performance in many cognitive processes, ranging from relatively fundamental processes to complex analogs/homologs of human cognitive tasks. Even in the one study that demonstrates an apparent radiation-induced improvement in pattern separations skills147, mice demonstrated reduced associative memory formation ability, and the apparent improvement may be attributable to an increase in sparsely encoded hippocampal-dependent memory. Thus, the overall consensus from ground-based rodent studies is that radiation exposure impacts performance in multiple cognitive tasks, utilizing multiple cognitive process governed by multiple brain regions. Mechanistic studies have revealed multiple changes in neurophysiological processes and dendritic structure within most brain regions investigated148–159. Moreover, there may be a loss of connectivity between brain regions149. Space Radiation Alone Impacts Cognitive Processes Deemed to Be of Operational Significance: While it could be argued that the loss of the ability to perform a task like novel object recognition may not have any operational significance, the radiation-induced loss of performance in rodent versions of tests widely used to assess attention and cognitive flexibility in humans cannot be so easily discounted. Astronauts are routinely screened during space flight for performance in a 10-test battery of cognitive tasks that NASA deemed necessary for mission success. Seven of the tasks in the “fit-for-duty” performance battery160,161assess some aspect of executive function. Executive function, in lay terms, can be summarized as the “Triple A”: the ability to Assess, Adapt and Achieve. More technically, executive functions are a set of higher order cognitive abilities that animals utilize to keep information ‘in mind’, attend to appropriate cues (e.g., nonverbal and verbal working memory stimuli), update information as contingencies change and invoke alternative, more appropriate responses to new situations. A key process that allows humans to rapidly and efficiently adapt to different situations is task- or set-shifting. An attentional set is formed when complex stimuli must be discriminated and classified as relevant or irrelevant to a particular task/situation. Set-shifting can be simplistically thought of as the ability to relearn what the most important discriminating stimulus (for a particular endpoint) is in a changing environment. Attentional set shifting (ATSET) thus enables subjects to rapidly adapt and respond to changes in the environment, and to perceive what is important for survival or completion of a task, skills that are required to deal with a sudden emergency. The Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) has been widely used to assess task switching in humans166, with task switching deficits being increased in patients with Parkinson’s disease167,168and autism169. The intra-dimensional (IDS)/extra-dimensional (EDS) set shifting task is a modification of WSCT that assesses set-shifting abilities in rodents170. Performance in the ATSET assay is impaired after exposure to ≤ 15 cGy of 1 GeV/n56Fe155,171, 1 GeV/n48Ti150,151, 600 MeV/n28Si148and protracted low dose rate neutrons172. Astronauts on deep space missions will have to act more autonomously than on previous missions, especially when rapid responses to unexpected problems are required. Creative problem solving skills will thus be of great importance to astronauts on a mission to Mars. Recent studies have shown that low (≤18 cGy) doses of 600 MeV/n28Si and252Cf-generated neutrons impact creative problem solving in rats148,172. Rather worryingly at the individual level, poor creative problem solving performance in the irradiated rats was not necessarily associated with poor ATSET performance, and vice versa148,172. Previously we have shown that while space radiation exposure impairs both spatial memory and ATSET performance, however, when the relative performance of individual rats in each task was compared there was no correlation between space radiation-induced loss of performance in each task173. These data suggest that risk assessments for radiation-induced neurocognitive impairment derived from a single cognitive domain may greatly underestimate the severity of the problem. Establishing Space Radiation-resilience and Incidence of Severe Cognitive Impairment: A notable feature of the rat-based studies was the marked inter-individual differences in cognitive flexibility performance of the irradiated rats, with some rats having performance metrics comparable to shams, while others completely fail to reach criterion in the cognitive tasks148,151,155,164,171. Analysis of the individual animal performance data using kernel density estimation to generate a performance probability profile, has allowed for an estimation of how frequently severe cognitive impairments are induced171,172,174. In these studies, the level of performance that was considered to represent severe ATSET impairment was set at the 5th percentile of the sham cohort performance profile (conceptually analogous to a Z-score of −2). Translating ground-based rodent studies into tangible risk estimates for astronauts remains an enormous challenge, but should similar neurocognitive impairments occur in astronauts exposed to low space radiation doses, a Numbers-Needed-to-Harm analysis (of the rodent data) predicts that ~30% of the astronauts could develop severe cognitive flexibility decrements171,172. Combining Spaceflight Hazards on Space Radiation-induced Cognitive Impairment: To date, this is a largely uninvestigated, but much needed, field of study for the effect of simulating multiple aspects of the space environment on behavioral impairment. Relatively little has been documented regarding cognitive functioning after extended exposure to combined spaceflight condition, and findings have been inconsistent. One study showed that mice exposed to HLU displayed behaviors suggesting abnormal exploration and/or high risk-taking behavior in the elevated zero maze. However, low-dose radiation exposure did not exacerbate HLU-induced behavioral changes where mouse was exposed to combination of low-dose gamma radiation and simulated microgravity by HLU175. In anin vitrostudy, synergistic changes of reduction in neuronal network integrity and cell survival induced by simulated space radiation and microgravity were observed176. Another study documented that learning and memory abilities were significantly reduced in rats under a simulated spaceflight hazards including microgravity, isolation confinement, noises, and altered circadian rhythms177. The potential interactions between space radiation, microgravity and other space environmental stressors should be addressed with comprehensive models including neuroimaging, electrophysiology, biological, and clinical data178. Additional and Future Considerations: Both sleep deprivation and sleep fragmentation (SF) have been linked to reduced neurocognitive functioning in humans and animals, and has a major impact on performance in multiple cognitive domains179–182. Two recent studies have established how inadequate/disturbed sleep alters the severity of space radiation-induced impairment of executive function. A single session of fragmented sleep uncovered latent ATSET performance deficits in rats exposed to both protracted neutron172and Si183irradiation that had no obvious defects in performance under rested wakefulness conditions. SF selectively impaired performance in the more complex set shifting stages of the ATSET test in the both neutron and Si irradiated rats. Set shifting performance has rarely been impacted by exposure in studies conducted with rats tested under rested wakefulness conditions. Thus, radiation-induced cognitive impairment may not be fully evident in normally rested rats, substantially underestimating the level of impairment that may occur when astronauts are on mission. Cognitive testing may thus have to be conducted under both rested wakefulness and SF conditions to get a more accurate assessment of radiation-induced neurocognitive impairment. Further ground-based studies on the impact of radiation on cognition in rodents that are under concomitant exposure to space flight stressors such as stress and social isolation are being initiated. Based upon the exacerbating effects of sleep reduction on the incidence, severity and type of cognitive impairments induced, it would seem likely that concomitant exposure to these other space flight stressors would result in similar “negative interactions”. Cardiovascular Response in Microgravity and Reduced Weight-Bearing: In animal studies, spaceflight-induced apoptosis of vascular endothelial cells has been shown to occur in the retina and brain, and this loss of endothelial cells correspond with markers of disrupted barrier function of the blood-retinal185and blood-brain barriers120,185,186. Impairment of arterial endothelium-dependent vasodilator function has also been reported to occur in cerebral and mesenteric arteries following spaceflight187,188. HLU has been shown to diminish cerebral artery endothelium-dependent vasodilation through the eNOS signaling pathway189and possibly through an upregulation of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1190. Although animal studies demonstrate that spaceflight can have acute adverse effects on the vasculature, studies of mortality among US astronauts exposed to low-earth orbit, relative to the general population, non-astronaut NASA employees, and nonflight astronauts, indicate the risk of death due to cardiovascular disease is not elevated191,192. Thus, spaceflight appears to have few long-term adverse consequences on the cardiovascular system. These mortality data are, however, somewhat limited in that most astronauts included flew in space for relatively short periods of time and remained predominantly in low Earth orbit. The risk for developing cardiovascular disease may be elevated as mission duration increases or as exploration goes beyond the Earth’s magnetosphere. Space Radiation-induced Cardiovascular Response: Emerging epidemiological research demonstrates that low-dose environmental, occupational, and medical radiation exposure increases the risk of mortality due to ischemic coronary artery and cerebrovascular disease193,194. However, these risk estimates of Earth-based irradiation are largely derived from low linear energy transfer radiation exposures, which have some fundamentally different properties from charged HZE particles present in the deep space environment. HZE ions, for example, produce greater adverse effects on cellular physiology through increased genetic alterations and perturbations to redox metabolism, leading to persistent elevations in oxidative stress195. Oxidative stress can impair vascular and cardiac function by direct oxidative damage or by activating cell signaling pathways that can lead to abnormal contractile, inflammatory, proliferative, or remodeling properties. In animal studies, vascular endothelial cells have been shown to be especially sensitive to the effects of radiation. For example, Soucy et al.196,197demonstrated that simulated space irradiation with56Fe ions impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the aorta and increased aortic stiffness; both these effects were secondary to the formation of reactive oxygen species. Other studies have likewise shown that simulated space radiation induces damage to vascular endothelial cells198,199which could lead to diminished barrier function and accelerated development of atherosclerotic plaque. Indeed, research by Yu et al.200has shown56Fe irradiated portions of the aorta in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice have accelerated atherogenesis in the targeted regions. In addition, space radiation has an adverse impact on cardiac tissue. Low dose whole body irradiation with protons or56Fe ions were reported to produce myocardial DNA methylation201.56Fe irradiation has also been shown to diminish left ventricular function and increase infarction size and mortality rate in mice with a surgically induced myocardial infarction202. Collectively, these studies indicate that the damaging effects of space radiation can occur within the myocardium as well as the vasculature. Combined Effects of Simulated Space Radiation and Weightlessness on Vascular Function: The possible synergistic impact of space radiation combined with microgravity-induced weightlessness on degenerative cardiovascular disease in astronauts is poorly understood. To assess this possible synergy, Ghosh et al.83examined the single and combined effects of simulated space radiation with56Fe ions and simulated weightlessness using HLU on endothelium-dependent vasodilation of mouse gastrocnemius muscle resistance arteries soon after the cessation of the treatments. Both56Fe ion irradiation and HLU alone each impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation, but this impairment was potentiated when the two treatments were combined. The endothelial dysfunction occurred primarily through the eNOS signaling pathway with56Fe ion irradiation and HLU, but with56Fe ion exposure the deficit was the apparent consequence of diminished anti-oxidant capacity and greater pro-oxidant protein expression in the artery, while with HLU the deficit in endothelium-dependent vasodilation was the apparent consequence of reduced eNOS protein content. These data indicate that a short-term consequence of space radiation exposure and weightlessness is the synergistic impairment of the vascular endothelium. Additional and Future Considerations: Understanding of the singular and combined effects of space-associated weightlessness and irradiation is only now beginning to emerge, and many areas of research are open to further investigation. For example, vascular alterations induced by radiation may not be uniform throughout the circulation, given that the local biochemical milieu surrounding blood vessels and local mechanical forces (e.g., blood flow and shear stress) may interact with the local radiation effects to produce variable responses in different regions of the body, such as in the coronary and cerebral circulations. Much of what is known about the effects of spaceflight on the cardiovascular system has come from the study of arterial vessels, but more research is needed to understand the effects of weightlessness and space radiation on venous and lymphatic vessels. This is particularly true given the likely involvement of venous and lymphatic vessels in the development of spaceflight associated neuro-ocular syndrome115–118and venous thrombosis203,204reported to occur in astronauts during long-duration spaceflight. Finally, little is known about possible sex-specific differences, or the effectiveness of various countermeasures (e.g., exercise, antioxidants, and nutraceuticals) on cardiovascular alterations associated with weightlessness and deep space irradiation. All these areas of research are vital as human exploration of deep space is being pursued. Tissue regeneration is both a highly mechanosensitive and radiosensitive process, relying heavily on mechanical cues imposed by Earth’s gravity205and protection by the magnetosphere from harmful ionizing radiation. Data obtained from spaceflight experiments have documented the extensive effects of spaceflight stressors on progenitor cell populations and stem cell differentiation capabilities. These cellular changes often propagate into physiological defects which may pose significant health risks to astronauts both during and after sustained spaceflight missions. This section focuses on stem cell responses across physiologic systems, primarily through use of both ground-based HLU models, but also simulated microgravity devices (e.g., rotary cell culture systems, rotating wall vessels, and 3D clinostats). The role of gravity in maintaining tissue homeostasis has become apparent with expanded study examining the effects of spaceflight on mammalian physiology. Dysfunction in stem cell populations contribute to many Earth-based disease conditions and can be enhanced by aging, oxidative stress, and genetic predisposition206,207. Adult stem cell populations are found in multiple physiological systems throughout the body and are surrounded by a highly organized and regulated microenvironment consisting of supporting cells and factors, resulting in the formation of a stem cell niche208. Following injury, damage, or normal cell attrition, stem cells within the niche receive signals resulting in transition to an active state and initiation of the differentiation process209. Therefore, in order for regeneration of damaged tissues to occur, resident stem cell pools must be activated and induced to differentiate into lineage specific cells210. Such activation signals may be biochemical or mechanical in nature, and therefore may be affected by exposure to microgravity. Spaceflight exposure may result in premature aging of specific physiological systems, and loss of stem cell functions may contribute to the initial observed tissue degeneration but more importantly, may be linked to regenerative deficits during long-duration spaceflight exposure beyond LEO. Microgravity-induced Stem Cell Alterations: Maintenance of stemness during microgravity exposure has also been demonstrated in several other stem cell populations including cardiovascular progenitor cells, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), hematopoietic (HSCs), and adipose derived stem cells. Specifically, studies using neonatal and adult cardiovascular progenitor cells exposed to microgravity on ISS and simulated microgravity in a clinostat resulted in altered cytoskeletal organization and migration in both cell populations215,216. Several of these responses were found to be regulated by miRNAs, thereby indicating that miRNAs may be a key mediator of the cellular response to spaceflight exposure215–217. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are highly conserved non-coding RNA molecules that are involved in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. They function via base-pairing with complementary strands of mRNA, in turn silencing them by cleavage, destabilization, or hindering translation. Furthermore, the authors found reduced yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) and Tafazzin (TAZ) signaling that can function to regulate transcription and is affected by mechanical load217. Neonatal but not adult cardiovascular progenitor cells exposed to spaceflight exhibited increased expression of markers for early cardiovascular development and enhanced proliferative potential, possibly mediated through miRNA signaling215,216. YAP and TAZ signaling also play an important role in MSCs, resulting in the expression of Runx2 and initiation of osteogenesis. The effect of microgravity on MSCs has been widely studied. Studies investigating YAP and TAZ signaling under simulated microgravity have shown inhibition of osteogenic differentiation by MSCs due to lack of TAZ nuclear translocation218,219. Several investigators have confirmed the inhibition of stem cell differentiationin vivo, as expressed in the osteochondrogenic precursor stem cell lineage in mouse models225. Mice exposed to spaceflight on the BionM1 capsule demonstrated reduced MSC commitment and corresponding increase in differentiation of the MSC lineage into osteoblasts and adipocytes following reloading226. Further experimentation of microgravity-induced altered gene expression suggests miR-132–3p as a potential inhibitor of osteoblastic differentiation225. Induction of cellular senescence is another potential contributor to the permanent proliferative state incurred by many cell populations under microgravity simulations. Minimal research has been conducted to elucidate the specific molecular modulators involved in spaceflight-induced cellular senescence; however transcriptomic analysis of space-flown mice suggests a p53-independent induction of the p21 senescence pathway227. Nevertheless, further experimentation is needed to fully elucidate these molecular pathways. Another interesting phenomenon is the change in lineage commitment of MSCs from the osteogenic lineage to adipogenic lineages similar to that which occurs during aging228. Several studies conducted using directed differentiation of MSCs under simulated microgravity have shown a preferential commitment to the adipogenic lineage through a variety of mechanisms including suppression of microfilament formation and RhoA activity229. Studies investigating hematopoietic lineage cells in astronauts found decreases in NK cells and reticulocytes following short duration spaceflight234. Post-flight assessment of astronauts indicate deficiencies in thymopoiesis235, a reduction in erythroid and myeloid progenitor cells236, and altered whole-blood transcriptomic and metabolomic profiles237. Interestingly HLU studies found significant changes to bone marrow HSC populations including increases in long-term HSCs (LT-HSCs), short-term HSCs (ST-HSCs), multipotent progenitor (MPP) cells and neutrophils but observed decreases in B-lineage cells, NK cells and erythrocytes. No recovery in HSCs and neutrophils following a 28-d reloading period was observed and repopulation assays showed significant impairment of the reconstitution ability of HSCs exposed to HLU234. Interestingly, significant alterations in myeloid colony forming units was also observed in mice following exposure to spaceflight on the BionM1 capsule238. Mice flown on the BionM1 capsule demonstrated a decrease in hematopoietic cells and a suppression of primitive multipotent progenitors that were not found to be reversible during a 7-day recovery period226. Human HSCs exposed to simulated microgravity have shown impairment of DNA damage repair mechanisms and accumulation of double stranded DNA breaks239. The differentiation capacity of these cells into dendritic cells was also impaired239. These studies highlight the reduced hematopoietic functions of HSCs following spaceflight and may demonstrate that altered immune responses in response to spaceflight exposure may originate, in part from deficits to HSC function. The effects of microgravity on neural precursor cells has also been gaining interest in recent years. Several studies have been conducted using simulated microgravity, including differentiation studies investigating the role of microgravity on human ESC-derived neural organoids240. Organoids exposed to simulated microgravity exhibited deficits in expression of forebrain markers indicating that microgravity directs differentiation towards caudal neural progenitors240. Interesting, as demonstrated in other stem cell populations, Wnt signaling may be a key signaling mechanism involved in this response240. Overall, studies investigating the impact of microgravity on stem cell function suggest that microgravity critically affects basic cell functions including alterations to cell morphology, cytoskeletal organization, gene expression profiles, differentiation and apoptosis related pathways218,223,232,241,242, contributing to the growing concern that the health of both stem cells and terminally differentiated lineage populations is threatened during spaceflight exposure. Findings that highlight the inability of stem cells to differentiate towards certain lineages emphasize the detrimental effect of microgravity on tissue regenerative processes and the need to develop therapeutic countermeasures before long-duration spaceflight missions are attempted. Radiation-induced Stem Cell Dysfunction: GCR-induced alterations in ESC functions have not been studied in great detail. A genomic analysis of murine ESCs during spaceflight reveals suppression of global gene expression and increased spontaneous chromosomal aberrations249. These genomic defects may contribute to increased ESC dysfunction or reprogramming. Furthermore, since ESCs are vital for repairing diseased tissue, loss of ESC stemness or differentiation abilities can adversely impact tissue regeneration and wound healing. Combined Effects of Radiation and Microgravity on Stem Cells: Stem cell regulation has been defined for individual spaceflight stressors (i.e. microgravity and radiation); however one of the fundamental questions to be answered in regenerative space biology is whether these stressors have synergistic effects on progenitor populations. Several studies describing tissue-level compounded effects by microgravity and radiation in the brain, retina, and skeleton have been reported250,251. It is possible that these tissue-based effects stem from aberrations in progenitor cell populations. Research conducted using gamma and heavy ion radiation demonstrated deficits in osteoblastogenesis due to increased oxidative stress in progenitor populations78,96,252. Additionally, as previously noted inSection 2, combined exposure of mice to HLU and radiation demonstrated depletion of progenitor populations that were rescued by administration of an antioxidant rich diet, the dried plum diet94. Recent research details that microgravity-induced osteoclast progenitor cell counts are modulated by space-standardized radiation251. Several research groups suggest that miRNAs may contribute to the regulation of compounded spaceflight effects254. Certain miRNAs may be differentially expressed depending on the combination of spaceflight factors inflicted. One such group demonstrates this by analyzing miRNA transcription profiles in peripheral blood lymphocytes exposed to simulated spaceflight. They conclude that simulated microgravity modulated the effect of radiation exposure by downregulating radiosensitive miRNAs, including important promoters of osteoblastic stem cell differentiation (miRNA-144), iPSC generation (miRNA-200a), and embryonic stem cell differentiation (miRNA-7)255. Lastly, research involving the effects of radiation and microgravity on human lymphoblastoid TK6 cells reveal no differentially expressed miRNAs under isolated factors. However, an interactive effect between the spaceflight conditions is exhibited, resulting in differentially expressed miRNA-15b and miRNA-221, both of which promotes stemness and tumorgenicity of cancer cells256. Taken together, research involving the interplay of radiation and spaceflight in stem cell functionality indicates a synergistic relationship, compounding the effects seen by each isolated factor. Additional and Future Considerations: Due to the extensive applications and potential benefits offered by stem cells therapies, research into these populations has increased over the past 10 years; however, we have only recently begun characterizing the effect of spaceflight stressors on stem cell populations and tissue regeneration. A majority of these studies have investigated alterations to HSCs or MSCs, leaving studies into tissue-specific and ESCs during spaceflight lacking257. Additionally, availability of true-spaceflight research focused on stem cell populations is limited due to limited resources and technology, therefore as noted researches must rely on ground-based models. As noted, these models fail to encompass all of the stressors and physiological effects associated with true-spaceflight, including full-body mechanical unloading, changes in fluid dynamics and systemic alterations258. As a result, research conducted to establish the compounded effects of microgravity, radiation, and other spaceflight-associated environmental changes on stem cell function are needed. Recent developments in research programs led by the ISS National Laboratory in collaboration with National Institutes of Health (NIH) and National Science Foundation (NSF), have expanded the capacity for stem cell research to be conducted in space. Specifically, these programs have increased interest in Earth-based applications and have specifically called for the use of micro-physiological systems and organ-based cultures in space. These programs, and foundational studies characterizing the maintenance of stem cell properties in populations exposed to microgravity conditions, have presented a unique opportunity for the use of stem cell populations cultured under microgravity conditions for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications. This has been explored in multiple paradigms, including the use of cranial-derived MSCs as a potential cell therapy for the CNS259, and is reviewed extensively elsewhere258,260. Although stem cells have been shown in multiple studies to retain their stem cell characteristics and exhibit delayed differentiation, there are also many other changes that have been observed related to microgravity exposure261,262. These alterations may result in unintended consequences from using stem cell populations cultured under microgravity conditions in cell-based therapies. As we start to explore the Solar System beyond LEO, from the Moon to Mars, expansion of studies in LEO investigating the effects of microgravity on stem cell function to the combined effects of microgravity and space radiation will be critical for understanding tissue regeneration capabilities. Maintenance of stemness in microgravity also poses a significant risk for the maintenance of tissue homeostasis, and for tissue repair and regeneration during long-duration spaceflight exposure. Exposure of radio-sensitive stem cell populations to deep-space radiation poses a significant concern for permanent and irreversible damage to stem cell populations while also posing a risk for stem cell depletion. Accumulation of DNA damage in stem cell populations that are activated upon stimulation, is also a cause for concern. However, in-depth research into the effects of combined spaceflight stressors on the numerous stem cell populations found in mammalian organisms is lacking. Furthermore, studies using whole animals and human cell populations (such as iPSCs) are also lacking; resulting in an incomplete picture of the effects of combined spaceflight stressors on stem cell populations. Although several studies have touched on the molecular mechanisms driving the observed changes, an in-depth understanding of the local and systemic mechanisms are still to be elucidated. Therefore, as new opportunities for spaceflight experiments are explored, it is critical to pursue the use of spaceflight for Earth-based benefits (including understanding basic stem cell function in addition to exploration of clinical applications) in addition to research enabling human exploration. Thus while HLU may induce some of the physical and phenotypic changes associated with space flight, it remains unclear if HLU induces similar signaling and molecular changes (e.g. increase in fatty acid metabolism that will impact neuronal function and thus cognition) as with microgravity. Moreover, whatever responses are induced as a result of the HLU, these occur in an animal that can be assumed to be under stress – although this in itself is a characteristic response in astronauts during spaceflight. The impact of such stress may invoke compensatory mechanisms that may, or may not, occur in humans while in space. Thus as noted, limitations should be considered with use of the HLU model. While PWB represents an alternative model and offers the possibility to investigate a wider range of mechanical loads, more studies are needed to investigate the response of multiple organ systems to reduced weight-bearing. For example, radiations have only been administered in PWB female mice, and more studies are needed to assess the benefits of this model to radiation research in larger outbred rodents. Further studies should also more completely profile the stress response resulting from PWB.
