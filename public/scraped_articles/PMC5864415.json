Many emerging applications of the microbiome, ranging from forensics (1) to medicine to optimization of the cleanliness of facilities where sensitive components are assembled (2,3), require analysis of low-biomass samples. These applications are moving rapidly away from microbial load measurement and toward the characterization of microbial community composition. Recent studies of the built environment have identified key factors driving the microbiome on surfaces and in air, including the transfer of microbes from humans to environmental surfaces (4), due to the fact that humans can shed 10 million bacteria/h in indoor settings (5). Other key factors modifying the indoor microbiome include temperature, humidity, airflow rates (6), ventilation type (4), and patients or health care workers (7). However, built environments low in microbial biomass remain difficult to study because of poor DNA extraction and amplification efficiency. Spacecraft assembly facilities (SAFs) are extremely low-microbial-biomass environments, even compared to other built or low-biomass environments such as hospitals (6), pharmaceutical production facilities (8), and indoor environments (3), because the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) takes extreme steps to avoid the transfer of any terrestrial contaminants to other planets (9). More than 15 years of microbiological surveys of various NASA and European Space Agency cleanroom facilities showed that 1 to 10 m2needs to be sampled to obtain reproducible microbiome signatures by Sanger sequencing, PhyloChip, 454 pyrosequencing, or Illumina sequencing (2). These procedures are critical because NASA allows only swabs, not larger sampling devices, for the collection of materials from sensitive spacecraft hardware surfaces (e.g., components of a sampling or life detection system, typically with surface areas of <1 m2). However, many other low-microbial-biomass environments are of considerable interest, including neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) (10,11) and aquaculture (12) settings, motivating the development of a general technique that works across these environments. To demonstrate KatharoSeqâ€™s utility, we applied it to three disparate built environments with low microbial biomass. These samples consisted of 100 25-cm2floor samples and 92 controls from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) SAF, 335 locations (primarily 25 cm2) across all 52 rooms of the NICU with 53 controls, and 159 sampling points (primarily 25 cm2) within an endangered-abalone-rearing facility with 33 controls. Choosing a DNA extraction technique for KatharoSeq. Description of the low-biomass microbiome bench protocol and computational analysis. KatharoSeq-specific recommendations are highlighted throughout the pipeline from sample collection to bioinformatic sample exclusion. Deriving sample exclusion criteria. Since one of the challenges in low-biomass microbiome analyses is determining how to exclude samples, we also evaluated the read counts across controls from this comparison. The number of reads produced per sample was also highly correlated with the number of input cells (Fig. 1d) and can thus be used as a guide for sample exclusion. When comparing the read counts of positive and negative controls, the Mo Bio PowerMag-with-ClearMag protocol was able to distinguish down to 500 cells, which was the lowest number among the kits tested (Fig. 1d). Upon applying the allosteric sigmoidal equation to the Mo Bio PowerMag-ClearMag samples, we determine that atK1/2, when 50% of the reads from the positive control mapped to the target organism, the read count was 683 (Fig. 1e). Thus, in the low-biomass experiment, one could exclude samples with <683 reads. All 24 DNA extraction negative controls had <683 reads, while only 1 sample from the 5-cell input and 2 samples from the 50-cell input generated at least 683 reads. Of the 500-cell inputs, 16 of the 18 samples had at least 683 reads and thus would be included in the analysis, while all 18 samples from the 5,000-cell input produced sufficient reads for inclusion. Thus, by using read counts from positive controls paired with the composition of those positive controls, one can determine a per-study limit of detection. Effects of cRNA addition on the total number of reads (a to e) and limit ofB. subtilisdetection (f to j) across all five kits evaluated. DownloadFIG S1, TIF file, 0.8 MB(838.5KB, tif).

For the subsequent built-environment analyses, we conservatively designated our sample exclusion to be the median read count of the 5,000-cell input. This was determined on the basis of positive controls for each built environment (SAF, 1,696 reads; NICU and abalone-rearing facility, 2,015 reads). Values will vary from experiment to experiment primarily because of differences in overall sequencing depth and, marginally, well-to-well contamination occurring during sample collection or processing and thus should be calculated for each experiment and sequencing run. Applying KatharoSeq to low-biomass environments. We applied KatharoSeq amplicon sequencing to three unique low-biomass environments: the JPL SAF, an NICU, and a facility for rearing critically endangered abalone. Together with positive controls from the initial low-biomass method development, a total of 1,072 samples generated 25,969,842 reads representing 16,417 suboperational taxonomic units (sOTUs). We also processed, 556 samples from the three environments for shotgun metagenomics (96 from the SAF, 337 from the NICU, and 123 from the abalone-rearing facility). The success rate of samples processed through the 16S rRNA amplicon pipeline (SAF, 57%; NICU, 50%; abalone-rearing facility, 90%) was generally higher than the success rate of the shotgun metagenome analysis (SAF, 64%; NICU, 44%; abalone-rearing facility, 35%). KatharoSeq revealed a SAF cleanroom-specific microbiome with a distinct and interpretable spatial pattern (Fig. 3). Beta diversity analysis revealed that a subset of seven samples clustered in a way that did not match the overall pattern (Fig. 3c), indicating a different microbial composition related to human exposure. When cross-referencing to the facility floor (Fig. 3f, red asterisks), these primarily low-traffic and normal-traffic samples localized to the top right corner and top middle of the facility, a nonrandom pattern distinguishing them from reagent contaminants or sequencing failures. Optimized KatharoSeq protocol applied to a JPL cleanroom facility. (a) The number of deblurred reads represented by the DNA extraction and PCR positive controls is plotted against the composition of the target organism. The distribution is fitted with an allosteric sigmoidal equation that describes the number of reads when 50% of the composition is recorded (K1/2). (b) The numbers of reads (median and interquartile range) per control type and floor samples are depicted, with the red dotted line indicating the sample exclusion value of 1,696 reads. NC, negative control. (c) Beta diversity PCoA plots calculated from weighted UniFrac distances from the JPL samples (n= 59) and controls (n= 15) with at least 1,696 deblurred reads, colored by foot traffic frequency (human exposure) and control type. (d) All 32 sOTUs found to be associated with the JPL floor community are shown in a heatmap in comparison with controls. (e) Associations of human foot traffic with sample composition of the top four most abundant sOTUs. (f) The most abundant sOTU in the samples,A. lwoffii, is mapped onto the JPL facility 2D map, with the samples deviating from the cluster noted with a red asterisk. Four sOTUs were identified by 16S rRNA gene amplicon analysis as frequent members of the JPL SAF microbiome, present in at least 75% of the JPL floor samples. These wereParacoccus marcusii,Mycobacteriumsp.,Novosphingobium, andAcinetobacter lwoffii.Sphingomonassp. was also present in 70% of the JPL floor samples. This organism was identified as a common SAF core sOTU in the Kennedy Space Center (KSC), Johnson Space Center, and JPL (15), increasing confidence in its prevalence in this type of environment. Thirty-two sOTUs were differentially abundant in the global SAF floor samples, compared to the one sOTU associated with the PCR positive controls (Fig. 3d). Of these 32 SAF-associated sOTUs, 4 were positively associated with high human exposure, as determined by differential abundance, and includedA. lwoffii,Enterobacteriaceae,Caulobacteraceae, andNovosphingobiumsp. (Fig. 3e). TheA. lwoffiisOTU was present in the negative JPL and positive PCR controls, but the levels were orders of magnitude lower than the real signal, indicating that this result stems from a minimal amount of well-to-well contamination (Fig. 3d). The composition ofA. lwoffii, when mapped onto the two-dimensional (2D) layout of the JPL SAF, is in lower relative abundance in the top right corner and top middle. This spatial pattern strikingly resembles the overall spatial relationship in the community level beta diversity analysis (Fig. 3c). Shotgun metagenomic analysis of very-low-biomass samples is very challenging, and most of the research on such samples to date has used amplicon-based techniques or whole-genome amplified products (13). Our floor samples had very low DNA yields, with a mean double-stranded DNA yield of 59.4 (standard error, 9.1) pg/Âµl, and 23% of the samples had DNA concentrations below the detection limit of 1 pg/Âµl. We performed metagenomic sequencing of 96 of the 192 samples, including 50 representative JPL SAF floor samples (based on the amplicon analysis) and 46 controls, without the use of whole-genome amplification. Comparing the SAF environment to two other low-biomass environments. A detailed description and interpretation of all three facilities are beyond the scope of this report, but we provide a brief comparison of the SAF data with the NICU and abalone-rearing facility data to demonstrate the utility of KatharoSeq in characterizing a range of low-biomass environments and relating them to one another (Fig. 4). Microbial diversity was broadly compared across three unique built-environment study sites for 16S rRNA amplicon and shotgun metagenome sequencing. (a) Microbial richness of 16S rRNA amplicon data was calculated for various sample types within the built environment and organized by human exposure (H, high human exposure; M, medium human exposure; L, low human exposure). LBM, low biomass, indicates the kit testing controls from the Mobio Powermag kit. Beta diversity PCoA plots of weighted UniFrac distances of 16S rRNA amplicon (c) and Bray-Curtis distances of shotgun metagenomic samples (d) demonstrate study-specific microbial communities. The floor samples within the three built environments are solid spheres in the 16S rRNA amplicon plot (c), while other samples are transparent. (d) Heatmap depicting the top 464 of the 16,417 most abundant sOTUs across the 438 samples that passed QC. Floor samples are indicated by a line to demonstrate the similarity and differences of microbes on the floors of the three built environments. Across the three built environments, the alpha diversity measured by microbial taxon richness was highest in the abalone-rearing facility, followed by the NICU and then the SAF (Fig. 4a) (Kruskal-Wallis test statistic, 131.8;P< 0.0001). Within each of the three environments, human exposure was associated with microbial taxon richness, although some of the details differed among the environments. Floor samples, most exposed to direct contact with humans, consistently had the highest diversity (Fig. 4b). In the NICU, the microbial taxon richness of keyboard, chair, and floor samples was positively associated with the human exposure of each surface. However, contrary to this general trend, the stethoscope and incubator samples had higher microbial taxon richness in low-exposure rooms. The reason for this apparent paradox is that stethoscopes and incubators are sanitized each day in occupied rooms, reducing their microbial diversity on a daily basis (Fig. 4b). At the abalone-rearing facility, the microbial taxon richness of the abalone tank wall and floor samples was negatively associated with human exposure, contrary to the general trend. However, this effect might be due to characteristics of the influence of the individual abalone species on their surrounding microbial environments, because the abalone species are physically separated from one another (Fig. 4b). The white abalone tanks were considered to have lower human exposure, because they are physically separated from the other tanks. The total microbial taxon richness was greatest on the surface of abalone shells, followed by the foot and then the feces, which could have implications for understanding exposures of abalone to environmental microbes (Fig. 4b). As expected and as a validation of the technique, the microbial community composition differed in each low-biomass environment, as measured by 16S rRNA analysis (Fig. 4c) and shotgun metagenome sequencing (Fig. 4d). The beta diversity distance of floor samples (solid-color spheres) from the other samples (transparent) within each built environment (by color) was smaller than the distances of floor samples from other built environments (Fig. 4c). The NICU environment, as a whole, had greater microbial richness than the JPL SAF but less than the abalone-rearing facility. Microbial richness was highest on the floor, lowest on stethoscopes and incubators, and intermediate on chairs, keyboards, and other surfaces (Fig. 4b). Relative to the floor, the incubator was enriched inKlebsiellaand the stethoscope was enriched inStaphylococcus(Fig. S4) andNeisseriaceae. No sOTUs were associated with acuity level or neonate occupancy when incubator, stethoscope, and floor samples were compared. Pathogen outbreaks in hospitals are of grave concern, especially when they occur in sensitive populations such as the ICU or NICU. We were able to observe from the metagenomic data strains that were relevant to clinical increases in infection and colonization in the NICU. In the months after the study, two cases of methicillin-resistantStaphylococcus aureus(MRSA) invasive disease (bacteremia) were identified as an increase over baseline number of noninvasive clinical isolates of MRSA (institutional review board [IRB] number 171209X). The high-acuity F pod had six MRSA-positive cultures in 5 of the 14 rooms, while the low-acuity GH pod had only six MRSA-positive cultures across 5 of the 37 rooms (42.9% versus 23.7% incidence). In accordance with these clinical observations, we found that samples from the F pod had larger proportions ofStaphylococcusthan those from the GH pods. Since the F pod is higher acuity, it has a higher density of health care professionals, potentially contributing a higher input ofStaphylococcus, and its rooms receive more frequent cleaning, which may maintain a harsh environment that unintentionally enriches drug-resistant bacteria. Whole-metagenome sequencing revealed that most of the staphylococcal signals wereStaphylococcus epidermidis, althoughS. aureuswas also present. To prevent disease outbreaks and minimize patient-to-patient microbial transfer, this NICU was designed to have individual patient rooms. An outstanding question, however, is when a patient is infected, what the effect on nearby patients is. Furthermore, when a patient has an infection, does this also colonize the room itself or is it confined to the person? We observed a second strain linked to a clinical event. In the detailed survey,Serratia marcescens, a human pathogen associated with nosocomial infections and septicemia in the NICU (16), was highly abundant on various surfaces in room 813, including the incubator, along with various surfaces in room 811 (Fig. S3). Upon chart review, the patient in 813 developed anS. marcescenslung infection, which was confirmed by respiratory and eye cultures on 12 and 13 January, respectively. The patient continued to have positive cultures on 13 and 23 February 2017 after multiple administrations of antibiotics. FindingS. marcescensin this room in multiple sample types 48 days after the initial positive culture, while not observing the organism in two adjacent rooms, indicates the potential utility of noninvasive built-environment sampling for monitoring and discovering infectious agents in a clinical setting.

The microbial composition of the abalone-rearing facility was distinct from that of the SAF and the NICU. The abalone-rearing facility uses a flowthrough system to supply seawater to the main aquarium, while the white abalone tanks receive UV-treated and filtered seawater. Abalone hosts generally had species-specific microbiomes from the feces, the foot, and the shell (Fig. S4). When comparing microbial communities by presence or absence by using unweighted UniFrac distances, the red and white abalone body sites clustered more closely with built-environment samples taken from the respective red and white abalone tanks (Fig. S4a). Further, the pink, green, and white abalone fecal communities were more closely related than red abalone fecal communities. However, some replicates from the white abalone foot and shell mirrored that of the environment, suggesting a more transient community (Fig. S4aandb). The most abundant sOTU in the abalone aquarium microbiome was aVibriosp. (Fig. S4c). Spatially, thisVibriosOTU was present across the entire facility and highly abundant in the fecal material from all of the abalone species sampled (Fig. S4c). Shotgun metagenome analysis revealed several potentialVibriospp. present across the communities, withVibrio breoganiifollowed byVibrio tasmaniensismaking up the majority (Fig. S4d). The other most common microbes in the facility werePsychrilyobacter,Pseudoalteromonas,Colwelliaceae, andLeucothrix, providing a microbiome markedly different from that of the other two environments sampled (Fig. 4d). The pathogen responsible for causing withering syndrome (12) was not detected in the facility or associated with the abalone hosts.

An isolate ofB. subtilis3610 cultivated at 37Â°C overnight was sorted by flow cytometry on a Sony SH800Z FACS by using SYBR green fluorescence, isolating 5, 50, 500, or 5,000 cells in a sterile 0.22-Âµm-filtered phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution. DNA extractions from each set of sorted cells were performed in triplicate with and without carrier RNA (Thermo, Fisher catalog no. 4382878) with manual single-tube DNA extraction kits (Mo Bio PowerSoil, where the consumables were autoclaved for 3 h [21], and the Qiagen Ultra Clean kit) (Fig. 1a). A 1-Âµg sample of carrier RNA was added to samples after lysis. Negative controls of the PBS with and without carrier RNA along with complete blanks were DNA extracted in triplicate alongside the positive controls as well. These single-tube manual protocols were compared to the high-throughput DNA isolation protocols adopted from the Earth Microbiome Project by using the same cultures ofB. subtilis(n= 9) with and without carrier RNA along with negative controls of PBS (n= 12) and blanks (n= 12) with the EpMotion 5075 liquid-handling robot (for the initial lysis steps), followed by the KingFisher Flex robot (bead-based DNA extraction). Two different bead cleanup protocols, Swiftmag beads and ClearMag beads, were tested (Fig. 1a). JPL SAF sample collection and processing. Patches of surface in an ISO class 7 cleanroom at the JPL SAF in Pasadena, CA, were collected on 31 August 2016 with ultraclean water-moistened sterile swabs. Each patch was 25 cm2. Prior to sampling, technicians donned cleanroom garments and two sets of people were dispatched to collect samples from the JPL SAF where most of the Mars 2020 spacecraft components will be assembled. Each set of technicians consisted of two members, one of whom actively collected samples from JPL SAF surfaces while the other carefully cut the swab heads with a sterile scalpel after sample collection. One set of technicians collected samples from 50 surfaces, and a second set of technicians sampled another 50 JPL SAF surfaces. Immediately after samples were obtained, vials containing sample swabs were frozen at âˆ’80Â°C and sent to the University of California San Diego (UCSD) via frozen shipment. Negative controls consisted of dry swabs exposed to air in the facility for the duration of a typical sampling event, and the same molecular-grade water was used to wet the swabs. Southwest Fisheries Science Center abalone research aquarium sampling. Abalone-rearing facility samples were taken on 14 and 24 February 2017 at a total of 159 sampling points, including 68 abalone-associated and 91 facility- or tank-associated samples (Fig. S4). Within the facility, seawater is filtered to remove larger (50- to 100-Âµm) particles, UV treated, and then ozonated to remove and destroy microbes from the water before deployment to animal tanks. Ten individual white abalone were weighed, measured for length, sexed, and then swabbed on the foot and shell, and four fecal detritus pellets were removed from the tank, for a total of 24 white abalone samples. Eight red abalone were swabbed on the foot and shell, and eight fecal pellets were collected from the bottom of the tank, for another 24 samples. Five green abalone fecal pellets were collected, and five fecal pellets were collected from three different pink abalone tanks. Each of the three pink abalone tanks represented animals that had undergone oxytetracycline antibiotic treatments at various times in the past (1 day, 90 days, or 3 years). Forty-one facility samples included 18 floor samples taken at two time points along with a door handle, two skimmer locations, and two table surfaces. Twenty-seven samples were taken from the white abalone tank, including five bottom, four turf liner, four wall, five PVC pipe, one air hose, four water, and four kelp food samples. Twenty-three samples were swabbed from the red abalone tank, including four tank lip (not touching water), two PVC pipe, four air stone, five water, four wall, and four kelp samples. All samples were processed through the KatharoSeq protocol, with equal volumes pooled and processed for 16S rRNA amplicon and shotgun metagenome sequencing. The work involving white abalone at the Southwest Fisheries Science Center was permitted under ESA permit no. 14344-2R issued to J. Hyde. Sample swabbing occurred concurrent with regular husbandry and health assessment monitoring that together was deemed ade minimusactivity and did not require IACUC approval. Amplicon library construction. 16S rRNA amplicon PCR amplification was performed as described in the KatharoSeq protocol inFig. 2, with all amplicons pooled at equal volumes of 20 Âµl and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq at 2 Ã— 150-bp paired-end reads. Sample volumes were equally pooled regardless of the presence of an amplicon band to reduce false negatives (Fig. S2) and as a comparative measure of the relative starting DNA biomass. PCR positive controls consisted ofV. fischeriat 0.1 to 500,000 genome copies (estimated by Qubit DNA concentration). Internal transcribed spacer PCR amplification with bar-coded primers ITS1f/ITS2 was also performed, but all samples failed to produce any detectable library and thus were not sequenced. De novosOTU picking was performed in Qiita (qiita.microbio.me) and QIIME as described above. Microbial richness was measured by determining the number of observed sOTUs per sample. The mean compositions of highly abundant OTUs from the QIIME analysis of the JPL SAF floor samples and across the various positive and negative controls are summarized inFig. S3. Finer-grainedde novosequence analysis was performed by deblur (25) and visualized in Calour (http://github.com/amnona/calour), providing single-nucleotide polymorphism resolution (Fig. S3). Microbial diversity was calculated by determining the total number of observed sOTUs per sample. Differential abundances of JPL SAF floor microbes were compared to JPL positive controls by using a permutation-based group mean comparison with the FDR controlled to 0.05 by using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure (29) within Calour (Fig. S3). Spatial mapping was performed with ili, a toolbox for molecular mapping in two and three dimensions (30) (Fig. 3d). To evaluate a deeper taxonomic resolution on the JPL SAF samples, we processed the JPL plates through the Kapa Hyper Plus library prep protocol. Only one of the two plates had enough DNA after library preparation to load onto the HiSeq Rapid Run 2 Ã— 250-bp run. Shotgun metagenomic data analyses. The sequencing data were processed through Trimmomatic 0.36 (31) to trim off low-quality reads and Bowtie 2.2.9 (32) against human reference genome assembly GRCh38 to remove potential human contamination. Taxonomic profiling was conducted with Kraken 0.10.5 (33) against a database that contains all of the complete genomes in the NCBI RefSeq database under the categories bacteria, archaea, viral, protozoa, fungi, and human as of November 2016. Relative abundances of taxa were computed by dividing the sequences assigned to this taxon against the total number of processed sequences. SelectedV. fischerigDNA-spiked samples were subjected tode novoassembly with SPAdes 3.9 (34). The resulting contigs were qualified with QUAST 4.3 (35) and further scaffolded with Ragout 1.2 (36) against theV. fischeriES114 reference genome (RefSeq accession no. GCF_000011805.1). The resulting draft genomes were aligned with the reference genome by using Brig 0.95 (37). Default parameter settings were used for these programs unless otherwise stated.
