Subject terms:Molecular biology, Mathematics and computing Muscle atrophy, caused by prolonged exposure to microgravity conditions, is a major challenge faced by astronauts during spaceflight1,2. Although intense physical exercise is currently the main countermeasure, it requires a significant amount of time from each astronaut (2.5 hours per day, including equipment setup and breakdown), and even with exercise, the continuous exposure to microgravity cannot be fully offset. It has been proposed that muscle atrophy may be at least partly explained by the dysregulation of cytoplasmic Ca2+levels due to abnormalities in the Sarco Endoplasmic Reticulum Calcium ATPase (SERCA) pump’s ability to reuptake cytoplasmic Ca2+during muscle relaxation1. Mammalian muscles are broadly classified into two types: slow-twitch muscles composed predominantly of oxidative muscle fibers (e.g., postural muscles like the soleus [SOL], which is found in the calf and is important for resisting the pull of gravity) and fast-twitch muscles composed predominantly of glycolytic muscle fibers (e.g., explosive muscles like the tibialis anterior [TA], located in the shin). The SOL and TA are two of the primary muscles impacted by spaceflight, and previous studies have shown that both the murine SOL and TA will atrophy in response to microgravity exposure1,3. With respect to Ca2+handling, recent work has shown that during spaceflight, Ca2+uptake is impaired in the SOL muscle while being enhanced in the TA muscle, indicating that SERCA function is affected differently in the two muscle types1. However, the molecular mechanisms driving these aberrations in Ca2+reuptake by SERCA are not very well elucidated. Additionally, as Ca2+handling at the level of SERCA was not impaired in the TA, it is possible that there may be other molecular drivers of the muscle atrophy phenotype. Understanding these mechanisms at the molecular level is important for prevention and mitigation. In this study, we present an ML-based approach to create a mapping between changes in multi-omics data (transcriptomic, proteomic, and epigenomic) and calcium reuptake in the SOL and TA muscles of mice that have been flown in space, compared to ground controls. To our knowledge, this approach has not been applied to this scientific question before. When choosing an ML method for the purposes of gaining insight into biomedical research, it is important to consider two criteria: explainability/interpretability and generalizability. Many conventional state-of-the-art algorithms, such as neural networks, are seen as “black boxes” due to the low interpretability of the values and interactions of intermediate neurons deep within the network. Such algorithms thus have low explainability and are not ideal for research, where the ultimate goal is not performance but rather acquiring a more sophisticated understanding of relationships between variables. Furthermore, a major challenge posed by multi-omics data, in particular, is the lack of generalizability of learned models due to the heterogeneity, high-dimensionality, and low-sample-size (HDLSS) nature of the data. Highly expressive algorithms like neural networks will generate severely overfit models when trained on HDLSS data6. With these criteria in mind, we chose to use a recently developed implementation of symbolic regression called QLattice, developed by Abzu ApS7,8. Symbolic regression attempts to find the true, concise mathematical function directly underlying the features’ relationship to the target, which is much more interpretable than neural network architectures and less likely to overfit. It does this by representing mathematical expressions as computational graphs, where the nodes represent variables or functions, and by exploring the possible architectures for these computational graphs. QLattice explores this graph space efficiently to find concise, interpretable, and accurate models, which make it a suitable tool for biomarker discovery9. We aimed to identify molecular drivers of spaceflight effects on muscle physiology using spaceflight mouse muscle data from the NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR) with omics data found in GeneLab10,11and Ca2+reuptake data found in Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (ALSDA)12. First, we trained QLattice to predict calcium reuptake levels of spaceflight and ground control mice using multi-omics features (genes, proteins, etc.), a regression task. Second, we trained QLattice to predict whether samples were from spaceflight or ground control mice, a classification task. We then identified features that contributed most to the predictive capabilities of the model’s output by QLattice; these features (i.e., genes, proteins, or epigenetic markers) are potential biomarkers that may provide mechanistic insight behind the spaceflight-induced muscle physiology effects and serve as targets for future interventions aiming to reduce the extent of muscle atrophy during space travel. Multi-omics biomarkers associated with spaceflight calcium reuptake aberrations are revealed by machine learning regression analysis Fig. 1. QLattice regression analysis of TA multi-omics data and calcium uptake. In the SOL regression analysis, the best-performing models mainly displayed relationships between the expression of different genes on the RNA level, related by mathematical functions such as Gaussian, linear, and exp (Fig.2a–c). We focused on the top 13 features across all models by rank, all of which were RNA-seq features:Gm35576, Rspo3, Gpc4, Klhl31, Sox6, Auts2, Sobp, Mdga1, Aox1, Tle4, Klhl33, Eepd1, Rhbdl3, andGm21955. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed significant enrichment of biological signaling involved in cellular differentiation, synapse organization and assembly, and neuron migration (Fig.2d). Fig. 2. QLattice regression analysis of SOL multi-omics data and calcium uptake. QLattice analysis identified 9 and 13 critical genes playing an important role in calcium reuptake of TA and SOL muscles, respectively, in the context of spaceflight-inducing muscle loss. Figure3depicts the changes of expression level in FLT versus GC for some of these genes and their corresponding proteins (when measurements are available) in both muscle types. Many of the genes identified have been described in the literature as playing a role in muscle recovery and we focus our attention on these genes. Fig. 3. Gene/protein relationship with calcium reuptake in SOL and TA muscles and putative mechanism.

All significance was calculated using Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon test two-sided: *: 1.00e−02 <p≤ 5.00e−02, **:1.00e−03 <p≤ 1.00e−02). Furthermore, Acyp1 has been shown to enhance the activity of Ca2+ transporters in phospholamban-associated calcium-ATPases, including SERCA-2a, which is predominantly found in slow-twitch fibers, the dominant fiber type in SOL muscle. We examined whether this pattern is consistent in the OSD-104 SOL multi-omics data and discovered thatAcyp1gene expression was also downregulated in SOL FLT relative to GC (Fig.3c), while calcium reuptake was impaired in SOL as previously reported1(Fig.3g). Note that QLattice was not trained to find this association for SOL muscle. Such a finding is, therefore, quite strong, suggesting a potential mechanism. The observed downregulation inAcyp1could contribute to impairments in SERCA function found in the FLT SOL, as it is known that phospholamban is highly expressed in this muscle and is less expressed in fast glycolytic muscles. Taken together, these findings suggest that Acyp1 may play a mechanistic role in the dysregulation of calcium induced by spaceflight (Fig.3d, f), but additional research is necessary to establish this relationship. The QLattice analysis for SOL revealed a very distinct set of genes (Fig.2b). This is, however, not surprising as only gene expression and methylation data were available. Several of these genes are already known for their relationship to calcium reuptake efficiency and muscle response to injury, and their levels are plotted for protein expression (when available) and gene expression in both TA and SOL muscle in Fig.3a–c.Gpc4is underexpressed in injury-activated muscle satellite cells17; similarly,Tle4is normally underexpressed following muscle injury to allow myogenesis18. In our data, bothTle4andGpc4were upregulated in mouse FLT SOL (Fig.3a, b), which displayed impaired calcium reuptake vs. GC SOL (Fig.3g). This may indicate that failure of properGpc4andTle4downregulation may play a role in damaged calcium reuptake, possibly by lowering overall muscle quality. This is supported by previous RNA-seq data showing that genes involved with myogenesis and differentiation were downregulated in the FLT SOL from mice19. Alternatively,Tle4expression is known to be triggered by calcium signaling20, so the observedTle4upregulation may instead be the result of increased cytoplasmic calcium levels due to impaired reuptake. Further,Rspo3has been found to be one of the most upregulated genes after SOL training and is associated with a decrease in muscle atrophy21, and its knockout has shown to compromise myogenesis and myotube differentiation22. Similarly, mice lackingKlhl31exhibit stunted skeletal muscle growth, centronuclear myopathy, and SR dilation23. In our data, bothRspo3andKlhl31are also upregulated in SOL FLT samples with lower calcium reuptake ability (Fig.3c), possibly as a compensatory or adaptive mechanism to increased calcium levels due to decreased uptake24. Multi-omics biomarkers associated with spaceflight calcium reuptake aberrations are revealed by ML classification analysis We then hypothesized that there may be other molecular pathways affected by spaceflight in mouse muscle that could be identified through feature relationships in QLattice models. Therefore, we broadened the scope of our analysis to identify multi-omics features that were predictive of the FLT or GC groups rather than restricting to a single phenotype. We used QLattice to classify FLT samples from GC and assessed the resulting models and feature interactions. In the TA classification analysis, we used all 3 types of omics data: RNA-seq, proteomics, and methylation data (Fig.4a–c). The top 11 features from this analysis included all 3 types of features:Trak2(RNA-seq),Tle4(RNA-seq),Tspan4(RNA-seq), Actin (Proteomic), Gm22281 (Methylation),Sell(RNA-seq), Ech1 (Methylation),Fhod1(RNA-seq),Egr2(RNA-seq),Klhl21(RNA-seq), andLrp2bp(RNA-seq). Fig. 4. QLattice classification analysis of TA multi-omics data and FLT/GC groups. In keeping with our hypothesis, gene set enrichment analysis revealed significant enrichment of pathways relevant to muscle biology and the neuromuscular response to stress, including skeletal muscle cell differentiation, positive regulation of myelination, and Schwann cell differentiation (Fig.4d). Interestingly, multiple pathways involved mitochondrial regulation, which has been previously identified as a molecular response to spaceflight in multiple tissues including muscle25. The pathway analysis also uncovered perturbation of actin and myosin structural regulation. The actin protein was the top proteomics feature found across QLattice models (Fig.4b) and was upregulated in TA FLT samples (Fig.5a). Actin is a key component in the myofibril bundles which generate muscle contractions after Ca2+release and signaling26. Further, the top RNA-seq featureTrak2is known to enable myosin binding activity for muscle contraction27.Trak2is also involved in the Rho GTPase cycle, which plays an important role in muscle mass regeneration and myofibrillogenesis27. TheTrak2gene is upregulated in FLT TA muscle in our data (Fig.5b), possibly as a muscle regeneration mechanism in a weightless environment.Tle4, the second highest occurring RNA-seq feature across all QLattice models, acts as a corepressor regulating muscle cell differentiation18. TheTle4gene is upregulated in FLT TA muscle in our data (Fig.5b), possibly due to the lack of a need for skeletal muscle growth in a weightless environment. Fig. 5.

All significance was calculated using Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon test two-sided: *: 1.00e−02 <p≤ 5.00e−02, **:1.00e−03 <p≤ 1.00e−02). Interestingly, bothTrak2andTle4displayed some co-occurrence with Actin. Out of the 20 models thatTrak2appeared in, 4 of them contained Actin, while out of the 14 models containingTle4, 2 of them contained Actin. This may indicate a co-regulation network between Actin structural muscle activity and muscle mass regeneration and cell differentiation in response to spaceflight, which could be further investigated in laboratory studies. In the SOL classification analysis, RNA-seq gene features comprised 69 out of the 80 features across all resulting models (Fig.6a–c). The top 9 recurrent features wereFam220a,Lrp4,Osgin2,Gm29686, Gm22281(Methylation),Sema6c,Alpk3,Tmod1, andBcam. For the most part, these features appeared in single-feature models related to the FLT/GC outcome by a linear, log, or inverse relationship. Of the 120 total models, 18 described relationships between 2 features. Interestingly, 11 of these were pairs of methylation and RNA-seq features, indicating a potential cooperative relationship between gene expression and DNA methylation in spaceflight SOL muscle response. Fig. 6. QLattice classification analysis of SOL multi-omics data and FLT/GC groups. Similar to the calcium reuptake prediction analysis, the SOL FLT/GC classification analysis mainly identified models with interactions between RNA-seq gene features. Gene set enrichment analysis of the top 11 features revealed enrichment of pre- and post-synaptic membrane assembly and organization (Fig.6d), in keeping with previous research showing structural alterations in muscle synaptic organization in spaceflight28. Appropriate regulation of muscular cytoplasmic calcium levels is key for several downstream calcium-dependent signaling pathways. Calcium reuptake is reportedly improved in TA muscle but impaired in SOL muscle, during spaceflight1, with limited understanding of the molecular signaling causing these phenotypic changes. Here, we report that enhanced Ca2+uptake in FLT TA is directly related to the combined interaction of Acyp1 protein downregulation and Rps7 protein upregulation; while decreased Ca2+uptake in FLT SOL is related to interactions of upregulation of several different pairs of genes, includingGpc4,Tle4,Rspo3, andKlhl31. The lower Ca2+uptake in FLT SOL is also correlated with significant weight loss for the SOL muscle in the RR1 flight samples (t-testp-value < 0.05); whereas there is no significant change in weight for TA muscles (Table1). Overall, the analysis provided here suggests that TA muscles are more resilient to space conditions, and Acyp1 and Rps7 seem to be good candidates to counteract weight losses and poor Ca2+uptake observed in SOL muscles. Average processed tissue weights for RR-1 SOL and TA groups. We conclude with our observations on the contributions of the different types of omics data to the QLattice predictive models. In this work, DNA methylation CpG+ features, when mapped to gene names or when maintained as genomic coordinates, failed to greatly contribute to model architectures and resulted in lower predictive performance. We suggest that this may be because methylation marks are deposited over time, so molecular changes during spaceflight are primarily dominated by functional changes, while small but persistent epigenetic changes may be better captured upon return to earth. To test this hypothesis, future studies could capture methylation measurements both before and after spaceflight from the same animals. In accordance with this hypothesis, both protein and gene expression changes were the most predictive features, with the top proteomic features much stronger and more cohesive than those of top RNA-seq features. This may constitute support in favor of focusing on proteomic analysis over RNA-seq analysis in future spaceflight studies, as the relationship between proteins and function is more immediate compared to the presumably noisier relationship between transcripts and function. RNA sequencing data (RR-1—SOL and TA muscles—female) Proteomics data (RR-1—TA muscle only—female) Bisulfite sequencing data (RR-1—SOL and TA muscle—female) Calcium reuptake data (RR-1 SOL female, RR-9 TA male) Calcium reuptake data was acquired from OSDR dataset OSD-48837, which contains rates of Ca2+ uptake in the muscle homogenates measured in a 96-well plate using the Indo-1 Ca2+ fluorophore1. These values were collected as a time series, with the measurements of cytoplasmic calcium concentrations taken at multiple points in time during a period of muscle relaxation. For our analysis, we use the area under the curve (AUC) as a measurement of calcium reuptake change over time. A lower AUC value implies more efficient calcium reuptake. The primary hyperparameters for QLattice (feynpackage v3.0.2) were the number of epochs and the maximum complexity of the architectures. The number of epochs corresponded to the number of generations for the evolutionary search algorithm as a whole rather than the number of epochs of backpropagation for any individual model architecture being explored. We tried various values for the number of epochs between 10 and 100, but there were no significant differences in validation performance or feature rankings. The maximum architectural complexity was restricted to 4 (2 features and 2 functional interactions) for the SOL analysis since SOL data had two data types, and we were interested in modeling the interactions between the data types. Similarly, the maximum architectural complexity was restricted to 6 for the TA analysis.
