Human exploration of the solar system will expose crew members to galactic cosmic radiation (GCR), with a potential for adverse health effects. GCR particles (protons and ions) move at nearly the speed of light and easily penetrate space station walls, as well as the human body. Previously, we have shown reactivation of latent herpesviruses, including herpes simplex virus, Varicella zoster virus, Epstein–Barr virus, and cytomegalovirus (CMV), during stays at the International Space Station. Given the prevalence of latent CMV and the known propensity of space radiation to cause alterations in many cellular processes, we undertook this study to understand the role of GCR in reactivating latent CMV. Latently infected Kasumi cells with CMV were irradiated with137Cs gamma rays, 150 MeV protons, 600 MeV/n carbon ions, 600 MeV/n iron ions, proton ions, and simulated GCR. The CMV copy number increased significantly in the cells exposed to radiation as compared with the non-irradiated controls. Viral genome sequencing did not reveal significant nucleotide differences among the compared groups. However, transcriptome analysis showed the upregulation of transcription of the UL49 ORF, implicating it in the switch from latent to lytic replication. These findings support our hypothesis that GCR may be a strong contributor to the reactivation of CMV infection seen in ISS crew members. Infection by cytomegalovirus (CMV), a member of the herpesvirus family, is highly prevalent in the human population, with estimated rates of infection ranging from 50% in developed countries to 90% in developing countries [1]. Herpes viruses of this nature have co-evolved with humans [2], and even more grandly, viruses in general have recently been regarded as integral and essential to the evolution of life on Earth [3]. This symbiosis is highlighted by the fact that humans become infected for life with these viruses, and primary infections are largely asymptomatic, although some immunocompetent patients may develop infectious mononucleosis. Regardless, all patients then become latently infected, meaning that the CMV genome is present in the cell but no virus is being shed and the transcriptional activity of the virus is limited to a few genes. Stress (acute and chronic alike) and/or an immunocompromised status, such as people living with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) or therapeutic immunosuppression, e.g., during hematopoietic stem cell transplant [HSCT], can initiate reactivation of latent CMV, resulting in conditions including retinitis, pneumonitis, and, more rarely, hepatitis, gastrointestinal ulceration, nephritis, and pancreatitis [1]. Additionally, active CMV replication during pregnancy can lead to intrauterine infection of the fetus, with the potential for congenital CMV, the consequences of which can include microcephaly, blindness, and developmental delay [4,5]. While anti-viral agents, like ganciclovir [6], are suitable prophylactics or treatments, no “cure” for latent viral infections exists. Thus, studying the cause and effect of reactivations as well as promoting non-reactivating countermeasures is key to limiting the virus’s detrimental possibilities. Human space exploration presents a unique hostile environment difficult to replicate on Earth with hazards including microgravity, ionizing and non-ionizing cosmic radiation, physical and psychological stresses of traveling to and from space, altered diet and nutrition, continually interrupted sleep schedules, reduced protection from electromagnetic fields, and physical and social isolation. The synergistic effects of all these risks can trigger (or worsen) medical problems, potentially hindering performance during long-duration space missions [7]. Not surprisingly, these unique features of space exploration result in increased herpes viral (EBV, CMV, HSV1, and VZV) reactivation [2,8]. However, it is unclear whether these increases are due to a dysregulated immune system, one of the aforementioned features of spaceflight, or a combination with other factors. Previously, we reported that ionizing radiation (gamma, proton, carbon, and iron) increased EBV lytic gene transcription and reactivation in AKATA cells latently infected with EBV [9]. In this study, we focused on the effect of space radiation to study CMV latency and reactivation, genomics, and transcriptomics. However, not only was individual ion radiation studied, but also the newly available simulated galactic cosmic radiation (GCRsim) at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The over-arching hypothesis is that modeled space radiation will induce reactivation and specific changes in the CMV genome/transcriptome. To accomplish this goal, CMV genomes and transcriptomes were harvested from mock-exposed vs. radiation (proton, carbon, iron, gamma, and GCRsim) exposed Kasumi-3 cells latently infected with CMV and sequenced using next-generation sequencing. Irradiated cells showed reactivation of CMV based on viral loading, but genome sequencing did not reveal significant nucleotide differences among the compared groups. Transcriptomics, however, revealed significant differences in expression levels of several genes. Most importantly, UL49 was significantly (p< 0.026) upregulated with a log Fold Change (logFC) of 1.48 in GCRsim-exposed Kasumi-3 cells compared with mock-exposed cells. Since UL49 is an essential subunit of the viral pre-initiation complex that regulates viral gene expression, it is possible that the GCRsim-mediated reactivation of CMV may be related to enhanced expression of UL49.

Kasumi cells from the above experiments were subjected to genomic analysis in order to reveal any single nucleotide polymorphisms or other possible variations in the genomes of irradiated cells compared with mock. For this purpose, total nucleic acid (TNA) was extracted from the Kasumi-3 cells from the above experiment. The recovered TNA was subjected to DNA analysis. The same TNA was also used for transcriptional analysis described below. The initial set of 22 samples (pre-radiation, D6, D12, GCR, Proton) did not reveal statistically significant genomic variants upon comparison among the groups. This finding indicates that there were no stable genomic alterations induced by irradiation during this study. Herpes viral reactivations in astronauts have generally been subclinical. However, medical events with viral etiology have occurred during spaceflight [10]. The cause of those reactivations, whether symptomatic or not, is not fully understood. Spaceflight imposes a multitude of stressors on the human body that can potentially directly (i.e., space radiation, microgravity) or indirectly (i.e., dysregulated immunity) cause the reactivation of herpes viruses. Our group has previously shown that lytic gene transcription of Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), which is consistently elevated in astronaut samples, is directly activated by a variety of radiation types and doses [9]. In the current study, we examined how ionizing radiation reactivated cytomegalovirus (CMV) in the Kasumi-3 myeloblast cell line. The GCR Simulator Project at NSRL generates an accelerator-based spectrum of energies that closely approximate those that are known to make up the shielded GCR environment in space, thus providing a unique Earthbound system to test CMV reactivation in culture for spaceflight applications. In-depth correlation analysis of CMV genomes and transcriptomes before and after radiation exposure has the potential to identify specific loci or nucleotide changes due to radiation exposure. In the current study, viral genomic comparison of pre-radiation, Day 6, Day 12, GCRsim, and proton samples did not reveal significant differences; however, transcriptomic analysis revealed differentially expressed genes when comparing the GCRsim-Day6 cells with mock-exposed cells (Supplemental Document S2). Interestingly, only UL49 showed a significantly elevated level (LogFC 1.48,pvalue 0.026) in GCRsim-Day6 cells compared with mock. UL49 is an essential subunit of the viral pre-initiation complex that regulates viral gene expression [13]. UL49 displays leaky late expression kinetics and is localized to the nuclear replication compartments. UL49 serves as a fundamental HCMV effector that governs viral gene transcription required to complete the replication cycle. It is likely that the GCRsim-mediated reactivation of CMV may be related to over expression of UL49. Efforts to grow a UL49 virus in the laboratory were unsuccessful. The radiation track structure likely plays an important role in CMV reactivation; however, this role is not clear. In general, the viral load is the highest 3 days post-irradiation and then decreases. The decay is the fastest for low-LET gamma rays and protons and slower for high-LET carbon and iron ions. The GCRsim follows the same trend, in-between low-LET and high-LET. We have also observed similar trends in our previous study on radiation-induced EBV reactivation [9]. It is possible that for a given dose, more of the DNA of the cell is affected by low-LET than high-LET radiation, which may favor viral reactivation. High-LET radiation tends to deposit energy in a more concentrated way than low-LET radiation. That leads to more damage to DNA and other structures, or more complex DNA damage, but the cell may die when the DNA damage is too complex to repair or when there is too much damage. Indeed, the viability of cells decreases similarly for most types of radiation 3 days post-irradiation. However, the viability of cells irradiated by protons and gamma recovers more than those irradiated by carbon and iron ions. Regarding cell size, the trends are harder to put into evidence. The changes in cell size observed may be due to the cytopathic effect on replication of HCMV. The cell size decreases slightly 3 days post-irradiation for all radiation types but returns (and even surpasses) the pre-irradiation size 6 days post-irradiation. The cell size increases the most with those irradiated with carbon and iron ions, especially at high doses. The cell size of those irradiated with GCRsim is similar to that of those irradiated by high-LET radiation. To our knowledge, we have produced the only two studies that report the reactivation of herpesviruses (EBV and CMV) by spaceflight simulated radiation. However, medical research and cancer treatments have observed the reactivation of CMV by chemo- and radiotherapy for quite some time [14]. While reactivation is generally considered a by-product of reduced immune surveillance by an ablated immune system, case reports exist of radiotherapies causing suspected CMV reactivation and subsequent life-threatening pathologies [15]. The authors noted in their case report that the adverse effects (neurological deterioration) occurred during or shortly after radiation therapy and that successful administration of antiviral treatment greatly improved the surviving patients’ conditions. Additionally, CMV promoters, like IE-1, are used for innumerable studies to drive the expression of transgenes. A few studies have reported that radiation can induce activation of CMV promoters to overexpress transgenes of interest and thus enhance therapeutic delivery [16]. For example, Jung et al. in 2011 [17] found that radiation-induced expression of the CMV IEX-1 promoter (pIEX-TNF-α) increased TNF-α sensitization of cancer cells, leading to enhanced tumor regression in a xenograft model. These articles as well as our data presented here support the idea that increased radiation received through spaceflight may lead to direct reactivations of herpesviruses independent of the known mechanism of immune dysregulation. Kasumi-3 cells (hematopoietic stem cell-derived monocyte progenitor cells) (ATCC CRL-2725, ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) were cultured in RPMI 1640 Medium (ATCC 30-2001) with 20% Fetal Bovine Serum (ATCC 30-2020), 20 U/mL penicillin, and 20 µg/mL Streptomycin. Cultures were maintained in nominal conditions at 37 °C, 95% humidity, and 5% CO2. To achieve the cell numbers needed for all the experimental conditions, primary frozen cell aliquots were subcultured for about 2 months prior to irradiation procedures. Kasumi-3 cells were infected with a low dose (multiplicity of infection [MOI] of 1) of CMV (TB40/E strain) and allowed to establish latency (10 days of culture with monitored viral gene expression). Once CMV latency was established, 500,000 cells/mL were seeded in 25-cm2(T-25) flasks and filled to capacity (70 mL) for transport to the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at the Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) in Long Island, New York. Cell size, viability, and CMV viral load were determined from a pooled sample prior to transport and were regarded as pre-irradiation baselines (Day 2). Filtered flask caps were replaced with plug caps, tightened, and parafilm wrapped. Transport was overnight (≈18 h) from Johnson Space Center (JSC) to BNL. Once received at BNL, plug caps were loosened and flasks were kept upright in nominal incubator conditions overnight. The next day (irradiation day), duplicate flasks of the cells were exposed to acute doses (0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy) within each modeled radiation type (gamma, proton, carbon, iron, and GCRsim) at room temperature. Control flasks of mock-irradiated cells were also included and placed out of the incubator during radiation treatment. After irradiation, flasks were maintained in nominal incubator conditions overnight until transport back to the Johnson Space Center Immunology and Virology Laboratory (Houston, TX, USA) for analysis. Cells were then aseptically split and harvested from each flask by removing 25 mL of cells and media on Day 3 post-irradiation and then every three days following (i.e., Day 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15). Except for Day 15 (the last day), harvested cells and media were replaced with 25 mL of fresh RPMI 1640 complete media. For each harvest, cells were split into 3 subsamples and then frozen for analysis of cell count and characterization, determination of CMV viral load, and next generation sequencing. 137Cs gamma ray irradiation settings. Individual ion irradiation settings used for the experiment. NSRL has a simulated full GCRsim field, which consists of 33 different ion beams, and a simplified GCRsim, composed of six ion beams (five different ions with protons at two different energies), with protons constituting most of the exposure and delivered first and last in the sequence [18]. For this experiment, the simplified GCRsim was used with the same total doses (10, 50, 100, and 200 cGy). The details of the beams, energies, dose rates, and irradiation times are given inSupplemental Document S1(file Mehta NSRL 21B GCR 5-26-21 beam records Final). Simulation of the irradiation of a volume by (a)137Cs photons, (b) 150 MeV protons, (c) 600 MeV/n carbon ions, (d) 600 MeV/n iron ions, and (e) simulated GCR mixed field. In all cases, the dosage to the irradiated volume is ~0.2 Gy. 4.4. Cell Counts, Size, and Viability Aliquots from each flask were taken at each experimental day (Day 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15) and assessed for cell count (per mL), cell size (diameter in µm), and viability (percentage of live cells from total). Data were collected using a Cellometer Auto 2000 (Nexcelcom, Lawrence, MA, USA). In brief, a homogeneous sample of each cell culture flask was removed and mixed 1:1 with acridine orange and propidium iodide solution (AOPI) (Perkin Elmer, Shelton, CT, USA) and plated on Cellometer SD100 disposable slides for analysis [9]. 4.5. Determination of CMV Viral Load CMV primer and probe sequences for qPCR analysis. 4.6. Genomics and Transcriptomics Mixed models were applied to explore how CMV load, cell size, and viability change across days and different types of radiation and doses. To account for interactions between radiation type, dose, and days, mixed models with full three-way interaction terms were constructed. Random effects of flasks nested within radiation type were incorporated to address repeated measures. Robust standard errors were used to allow for non-homogeneous variance across time. The outcomes were assumed to follow a gamma distribution. Multiple comparisons between each group and the control group were adjusted using either simulation or the Bonferroni method. The alpha level was set at 0.05. All statistical analyses were performed using the software SAS 9.4. We conducted tests based on the mixed model described above. Specifically, we first compared each dose of radiation against the control group. Then, we compared the average of all radiation groups against the control group. Finally, we compared each dose against the control at each day post-radiation. It is undeniable that herpesviruses reactivate from latency upon space travel. The cause of this reactivation is complicated and likely multifold. In this study on CMV (and our previous one with EBV), we show that space radiation has a direct effect on the reactivation of herpesviruses.
