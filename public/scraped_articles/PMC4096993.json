  "content": "Mimicking the host and its microenvironmentin vitrofor studying mucosal infections byPseudomonas aeruginosa Why is a healthy person protected fromPseudomonas aeruginosainfections, while individuals with cystic fibrosis or damaged epithelium are particularly susceptible to this opportunistic pathogen? In order to address this question, it is essential to thoroughly understand the dynamic interplay between the host microenvironment andP. aeruginosa. Therefore, using modeI systems that represent key aspects of human mucosal tissues in health and disease allows recreatingin vivohost-pathogen interactions in a physiologically relevant manner. In this review, we discuss how factors of mucosal tissues, such as apical-basolateral polarity, junctional complexes, extracellular matrix proteins, mucus, multicellular complexity (including indigenous microbiota), and other physicochemical factors affectP. aeruginosapathogenesis and are thus important to mimicin vitro. We highlightin vitrocell and tissue culture model systems of increasing complexity that have been used over the past 35 years to study the infectious disease process ofP. aeruginosa, mainly focusing on lung models, and their respective advantages and limitations. Continued improvements ofin vitromodels based on our expanding knowledge of host microenvironmental factors that participate inP. aeruginosapathogenesis will help advance fundamental understanding of pathogenic mechanisms and increase the translational potential of research findings from bench to the patient’s bedside. As a leading cause of life-threatening nosocomial infections,Pseudomonas aeruginosahas been extensively studied over the past 35 years. No currently availablein vitroorin vivomodel system is able to completely mimic theP. aeruginosadisease phenotype. Accordingly, the complexity of the host, pathogen and host-pathogen interactions has necessitated a combined use of different model systems to advance our understanding ofP. aeruginosainfectious disease.P. aeruginosais most commonly studied in the context of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, where chronic lung inflammation caused by this microorganism is believed to be the major source of mortality (Yang,et al., 2011,Doring,et al., 2012). In the thick, viscous CF lung mucus,P. aeruginosaprimarily exists as persistent alginate-overproducing (mucoid) biofilms that adhere to mucus compounds, but not to lung epithelium, and are resistant to available antimicrobial agents and the host immune system (Hoiby,et al., 2010,Schobert & Tielen, 2010,Breidenstein,et al., 2011).P. aeruginosa-associated components (such as LPS, lectins, alginate) and secreted factors (such as quorum sensing molecules and pyocyanin) generate an extreme inflammatory response, which is destructive for the host but not the pathogen (Gellatly & Hancock, 2013). Furthermore, acuteP. aeruginosainfections frequently occur in patient populations with a damaged epithelial barrier (such as in burn wound patients, following intestinal surgery, at insertion sites of catheters or endotracheal tubes, or in scratched cornea), or compromised immune system (such as HIV and cancer patients) (Gellatly & Hancock, 2013). During acute infections, disease or injury-related epithelial modifications that mediateP. aeruginosaadhesion are believed to contribute to the infectious disease process, thereby necessitating direct host-pathogen interactions (Engel & Eran, 2011). Herewith, the type three secretion system (T3SS) (Lee,et al., 2005), various adhesins (such as lectins, flagella and type IV pili) and secreted virulence factors dictate the course of disease (Engel & Eran, 2011). In vitrocell and tissue culture models have served as useful platforms to dissect the molecular mechanisms and phenotypic properties from both the host and pathogen side that underly the infectious disease process. While manyin vitromodels are oversimplistic and lack key properties of the parental tissue, increasing efforts are made to design more physiologically relevant models, and to explore their potential forP. aeruginosapathogenesis studies. At the other extreme are animal models, which have advanced our knowledge on variousP. aeruginosa-induced illnesses, but often do not mimic human physiology and disease, are complex and require extensive expertise. Since manyin vitrofindings have been confirmed using animal models (Pier,et al., 1996,Martin, et al.,Bucior,et al., 2013,Cory,et al., 2013), it is relevant to utilizein vitromodel systems to initially explore fundamental questions and to verify select findingsin vivo. This approach can significantlyrefineandreducethe use of animal models. Finally, with promising ongoing projects, such as Donald Ingber’s human-on-a-chip (Marx,et al., 2012), complex multi-organ systems might one day be engineered which could accomplish the third “R”,replacementof animal models. The host microenvironment affects virulence properties ofP. aeruginosa. Therefore, mimicking the host microenvironment is essential for the development ofin vitroinfection models that better mimicin vivophenotypes ofP. aeruginosa, which will facilitate the design of novel efficacious antimicrobial treatments. In this review, we highlight that the choice of the model system, and the host characteristics that it mimics, can significantly impact theP. aeruginosaphenotype and outcome of the infection study. For detailed information about the immunomodulatory, cytotoxic and detrimental effects thatP. aeruginosaand its virulence factors exert on the host during acute and chronic infections, we refer readers to excellent reviews (Sadikot,et al., 2005,Gellatly & Hancock, 2013). This review describesin vitromodel systems of mucosal tissues with increasing complexity that reconcile key characteristics of the host involved in theP. aeruginosainfectious disease process. However, before discussing these models and thein vivotraits that they mimic, we start by providing a concise overview of host factors that affectP. aeruginosadisease initiation and progression, regardless of whether they are modified byP. aeruginosaupon host encounter. Given that mostP. aeruginosainfections are located in mucosal tissues, we focus on this infection site, with particular emphasis on the lung. How does the mucosal epithelium contribute toP. aeruginosavirulence? The healthy mucosal epithelium is protected fromP. aeruginosa The lung mucosal tissue in a healthy person (A), a patient with damaged epithelium (e.g., bronchoscopy, cathether, and surgery) (B), and a cystic fibrosis patient (C). Key factors that protect a healthy host againstP. aeruginosainfection (A) or that contribute toP. aeruginosainitiation of infectious disease (B and C) are depicted. While additional host factors are altered during disease, only those that have a well-documented effect onP. aeruginosapathogenesis are presented. In addition, host factors that are changed due to infection byP. aeruginosaare not included or discussed. The injured mucosal epithelium mediatesP. aeruginosainfection Host factors of mucosal tissues altered during disease that affectP. aeruginosa, and increase the risk for infectious disease Induced production of pyocyanin Downregulation pyoverdine, induction pyocheline Induced alginate production, OprF, loss of flagella Increased biofilm, altered biofilm proteomics (e.g., induction azurin) Increased PI-I lectin, pyocyanin, biofilm Enhanced expression of PQS and its precursors, pyocyanin, PA-I lectin Enhanced virulence againstLactobacillusspp. andCaenorhabditis elegans Changes in gene expression (e.g., induction of genes encoding elastase, multidrug efflux pumps) Changes in protein expression (e.g., induction SOD, pyocyanin, OprF genes) Enhanced quorum sensing, phenazine, exotoxin, biofilm Diminished host clearance (via lack of binding to CFTR) Effects due to changes in mucus (see “dehydrated mucus”) Enhanced adhesion, invasion, cytotoxicity (via binding asialoGM1, fibronectin, integrin α5β1) Diminished host clearance (via lack of binding to CFTR) CF = cystic fibrosis, NO = nitric oxide, PQS =Pseudomonasquinolone signal, SOD = superoxide dismutase, CFTR = cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, 3-oxo-C12-HSL =N-(3 oxododecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone The CF lung environment is an ideal ecological niche forP. aeruginosa Since host microenvironmental factors have been demonstrated to be key in the initial survival, persistence, and ultimately adaptation ofP. aeruginosain the lung (Yang,et al., 2011,Folkesson,et al., 2012), mimicking the host and the microenvironment is essential when studying theP. aeruginosainfectious disease process. In this review, we mainly focus on the lung mucosa environment. Whichin vitrocell culture models are used to studyP. aeruginosapathogenesis in mucosal tissues? Overview ofin vitrocell and tissue culture models of the human lung used to study theP. aeruginosapathogenesis process TJ = tight junctions, CFTR = cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, IVOC =in vitroorgan culture Between 2D and 3D: Air-liquid interface Three-dimensional cell culture models Three-dimensional (3-D) cell culture models that have been explored forP. aeruginosainfection studies include (i) 3-D models generated using the rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor (Barrila,et al., 2010), and (ii) 3-D cell spheroids generated through gentle agitation (Worlitzsch,et al., 2002,Ulrich & Doring, 2004,Ulrich,et al., 2005). The RWV is an optimized form of suspension culture in which cells are typically grown on the surface of porous ECM-coated microcarrier beads under low fluid shear and gentle mixing conditions. The dynamic culture conditions in the RWV enable cells to differentiate into well-organized 3-D tissue-like structures (termed 3-D aggregates), which replicate many of thein vivocharacteristics including apical-basolateral polarity, a single cell layer for lung and intestinal tissues, tight junctions, mucus production, and differentiation into several epithelial cell types (Barrila,et al., 2010). These models are amenable to most infectious disease-related assays, with the exception of transcytosis, enable co-culturing of multiple cell types, offer targeted high-throughput analysis and exhibit keyin vivo-like responses to pathogens, their toxins, and antimicrobial therapeutics not observed with conventional cell culture models (Barrila,et al., 2010,Crabbé,et al., 2011,Radtke,et al., 2011). Disadvantages are that these models are more expensive, labor-intensive, require relatively long incubation times (e.g. 9–12 days for 3-D A549 model) compared to 2-D monolayers, and are currently not amenable to chronic infection studies. Another 3-D lung epithelial model is generated through incubation of primary airway epithelial cells under gentle agitation (Worlitzsch,et al., 2002,Ulrich & Doring, 2004,Ulrich,et al., 2005). As a result, cells naturally aggregate and generate sphere-shaped clumps (spheroids) that contain a mixed cell population, including ciliated and mucus-secreting goblet cells. A major advantage of this 3-D cell culture model is its long-term viability and differentiated state (6 months when derived from nasal polyps and 6 weeks when derived from lung tissue). In addition, this model is easy to generate, inexpensive and could allow targeted high-throughput studies. Downsides include the long culture time (4 weeks) and the questionable physiological relevance, with regard toin vivo-like architecture and polarity. Earlier studies have used small intact pieces (about 3 mm2, 2–3 mm thick) of human or animal tissue to studyP. aeruginosainfection. For lung studies,in vitroorgan cultures (IVOCs) were generated from adenoids (from adenoid hypertrophy patients) (Tsang,et al., 1994), nasal polyps (Bajolet-Laudinat,et al., 1994), human nasal turbinate tissue, non-transplanted lung tissue from transplant recipients (Dowling,et al., 1997,Dowling,et al., 1997,Dowling,et al., 1999,Sajjan,et al., 2004), or from dissected mouse tissue (Bucior,et al., 2013). Advantages of this model system are that it enables research in physiologically relevant human/animal tissue that maintains thein vivostructure and integrity. IVOCs closely approximate thein vivoratio of differentiated lung cell types (including leucocytes) that interact with the native ECM and submucosal tissues in a physiological 3-D environment (Middleton,et al., 2003,Sajjan,et al., 2004). Moreover, these models secrete mucus and maintain epithelial integrity for 10 and 20 days, respectively (Jackson,et al., 1996,Boat,et al., 1997). Disadvantages include the low availability of human tissue biopsies, limited life span of cell types within the tissues (such as leucocytes) (Farley,et al., 1986,Forsgren,et al., 1994), and biological variation. In addition, this model requires specific expertise and is time-consuming. ForP. aeruginosainfection studies specifically, exfoliation of epithelial cells is already observed after 4h of infection, which limits the usefulness of this model for long-term studies (Plotkowski,et al., 1989). Of note, in a similar manner as for Transwells, IVOCs can be grown at an air-liquid interface (Sajjan,et al., 2004), which more closely simulates the conditions encountered by the respiratory mucosain vivo, and can result in significant differences in the infectious disease outcome compared to submersion of the apical surface in medium (Middleton,et al., 2003). Other cell culture models with potential forP. aeruginosapathogenesis In this section, we briefly address other cell culture models that have, to our knowledge, not yet been utilized for studyingP. aeruginosapathogenesis in mucosal tissues, but could be of interest. Mucosal cell culture models within vivo-like 3-D architecture, polarity and other physiological traits are commonly generated by growing cells in a 3-D matrix scaffold comprised of single or multiple ECMs, termedhydrogels, that mimic the lamina propria (Kleinman & Martin, 2005,Inman & Bissell, 2010,Zhang,et al., 2011). Since bacteria will encounter the hydrogel first, followed by the basolateral cell surface, this model is relevant when studying basolateralP. aeruginosainfections (Alarcon,et al., 2009,Bucior,et al., 2010). For mucosal tissues (where pathogens infect at the apical side), the infection process might not be physiologically relevant (Barrila,et al., 2010).Acellular (or decellularized) scaffoldsgenerated from animal or human tissues have recently emerged that mimic the complex 3-D architecture and ECM composition of their parental counterpart (reviewed by (Wagner,et al., 2013)). Exponential progress has been made over the past years to improve tissue decellularization and repopulation with different cell types (Cortiella,et al., 2010,Ott,et al., 2010,Daly,et al., 2012,Petersen,et al., 2012,Crabbé,et al., 2014,Mendez,et al., 2014,Wagner,et al., 2014). However, complete recellularization of the lung surface with differentiated functional lung epithelium (and establishment of barrier function) has to precede the usefulness of these models for infectious disease research purposes. In the future, model systems generated from decellularized scaffolds might offer attractive platforms to study infectious diseases, given the enhanced 3-D architectural complexity compared to currently available models and the possibility to include biomechanical forces, such as breathing movement. The recently developedorgan-on-a-chipmodel simulates key characteristics of the host microenvironment, including biomechanical forces (fluid shear and viscoelastic stretch), 3-D organization of distinct tissues (e.g. interfaces between epithelium and vascular endothelium), and biochemical properties (Huh,et al., 2011). For example, the lung-on-a-chip model reconstitutes the surfactant-producing alveolar-capillary interface on a collagen-coated porous silicon wafer, and mimics the cyclic biomechanical stretch force of breathing and vascular perfusion (Huh,et al., 2010). Neutrophil transmigration in response to apical exposure withEscherichia coliwas demonstrated, indicating the usefulness of this system to mimic the innate cellular response to bacterial infection (Huh,et al., 2010). Therefore, the organ-on-a-chip model holds tremendous potential for further unraveling ofP. aeruginosapathogenesis mechanisms. Which physiological characteristics of mucosal tissue models affect the study ofP. aeruginosapathogenesis? Apical and basolateral polarity Receptors and other host-associated factors differentially expressed at apical and basolateral surfaces are important for the clearance ofP. aeruginosain the healthy host, and for colonization of damaged epithelium (reviewed in (Engel & Eran, 2011,Pier, 2012)). Therefore, mucosal cell culture models that replicate epithelial cell polarity of the host tissue in health and disease are essential to assess host and pathogen responses to infection (Engel & Eran, 2011,Srikanth,et al., 2011,Law,et al., 2013). When studying resistance of the healthy host toP. aeruginosainfection, it is relevant to mimic thein vivo-like cell polarity (Engel & Eran, 2011). On the other hand, it is key to replicate the affected polarity of damaged epithelium when studyingP. aeruginosain the context of acute infections (Fleiszig,et al., 1998,Plotkowski,et al., 1999,Kazmierczak,et al., 2004). When the basolateral epithelial cell surface is accessible in the context of damaged epithelium, it is the preferred site forP. aeruginosabinding (Bucior,et al., 2010,Bucior,et al., 2012). Since basolateral receptors are enriched at the apical side of repairing (incompletely polarized) epithelium,P. aeruginosaadhesion, invasion, and cytotoxicity is enhanced compared to polarized epithelium (Heiniger,et al., 2010) (Fleiszig,et al., 1998,Kazmierczak,et al., 2004). Interestingly,P. aeruginosa(both planktonic cells and aggregates) can enhance the expression of basolateral receptors at the apical surface to facilitate its uptake through activation of host signaling pathways (Kierbel,et al., 2005,Gassama-Diagne,et al., 2006,Kierbel,et al., 2007,Lepanto,et al., 2011,Bucior,et al., 2012). In addition, putativeP. aeruginosareceptors such as apical asialo ganglioside M1 (asialoGM1), and the integrin α5β1 are transiently enriched at the surface of spreading and repairing respiratory epithelial cells (de Bentzmann,et al., 1996,Roger,et al., 1999), even though the role of asialoGM1 inP. aeruginosabinding is controversial (Schroeder,et al., 2001). Furthermore, apical expression of N-glycoproteins depends on the differentiation/polarization status of epithelial cells, and affects type IV pili-mediated binding, invasion and cytotoxicity ofP. aeruginosa(Bucior,et al., 2010,Bucior,et al., 2012). Therefore, binding ofP. aeruginosato apical surfaces can be inhibited by competitive blockage of exogenous sugars (Bucior,et al., 2013). To further validate the role of cell polarity duringP. aeruginosainfections, adhesion and invasion of this bacterium was significantly reduced in a polarized 3-D A549 lung model compared to non-polarized 2-D A549 monolayers (Carterson,et al., 2005). Differential colonization of polarized and non-polarized epithelium is also observed for other mucosal pathogens (such asSalmonella) (Barrila,et al., 2010,Law,et al., 2013). Taken together, the loss of polarity in repairing epithelium facilitatesP. aeruginosacolonization compared to intact epithelium, presumably through increased expression of apical receptors, enhanced binding to basolateral receptors, and absence of a functional CFTR. While these studies are relevant for acute infections involving damaged epithelium, they highlight that tissue culture models of improperly polarized epithelium can result in an artificially different susceptibility toP. aeruginosainfection (Carterson,et al., 2005,Heiniger,et al., 2010). When studying the influence ofP. aeruginosaand its virulence factors on epithelial barrier integrity or other aspects of theP. aeruginosainfectious disease process, choosing a cell culture model that expresses markers of the apical junctional complex is critical. While most epithelial cells, including lung, require growth on permeable membranes or as 3-D cultures to form tight junctions (e.g. A549, ΔF508-CFTR and WT-CFTR bronchial epithelial cells), a limited number of epithelial cells are capable of forming tight junctions when grown as 2-D monolayers (e.g., Caco-2, HT-29, T84) (Jain,et al., 2011,Hoentsch,et al., 2012,Law,et al., 2013). Interestingly, certain epithelial cells show enhanced barrier function in response to lipoxins, azithromycin or hypoxia (Kohler,et al., 2005,Asgrimsson,et al., 2006,Grumbach,et al., 2009,Hirota,et al., 2010,Olson,et al., 2011), while elevated (diabetic) glucose levels can reduce transepithelial resistance (Garnett,et al., 2013). Barrier integrity in anin vitromucosal culture model is essential to avoid accessibility ofP. aeruginosato the basolateral surface, especially given its preferential binding to basolateral receptors (Bucior,et al., 2010). When studying the effect ofP. aeruginosavirulence factors that affect barrier function (including ExoS,N-(3 oxododecanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone (3-oxo-C12HSL), rhamnolipids, and elastase (Azghani,et al., 1993,Vikstrom,et al., 2006,Zulianello,et al., 2006,Soong,et al., 2008,Halldorsson,et al., 2010,Wallace,et al., 2013)), it is important to distinguish targeted disruption of cell-cell contacts from host cell death and subsequent disruption of epithelial integrity (Zulianello,et al., 2006,Soong,et al., 2008,Engel & Eran, 2011). Usingin vitromodels that do not express tight junctions or have diminished barrier function are relevant for diseases involving repairing epithelium, while intact barrier integrity characterizes mucosal tissues of a healthy host (Plotkowski,et al., 1999,Garnett,et al., 2013). In the airways, mucins are either gel-like mucous secretions produced by goblet cells and submucosal glands (MUC5AC, MUC5B, MUC2) or associated with the membranes or cilia of respiratory epithelial cells (MUC1, MUC4 and MUC16) (Hovenberg,et al., 1996) (Li,et al., 1997,Sharma,et al., 1998,Groneberg,et al., 2003,Schulz,et al., 2005). Ciliated and non-ciliated epithelial cells produce membrane-associated mucins (Buisine,et al., 1999,Hattrup & Gendler, 2008,Evans & Koo, 2009,Voynow & Rubin, 2009). Model systems that contain a mucus layer include IVOCs and primary airway epithelium grown at an ALI (Plotkowski,et al., 1991,Coakley,et al., 2003,Paradiso,et al., 2003,Gray,et al., 2004,Sajjan,et al., 2004). In addition, RWV-derived 3-D culture models of several epithelial cell lines (A549, BEAS2-B, HT-29, Int-407) exhibit mucus production, including MUC5AC and MUC1, while the same cells grown as 2-D monolayers show a very low or absent mucus content (Nickerson,et al., 2001,Carterson,et al., 2005,Honer zu Bentrup,et al., 2006,Vaughan,et al., 2006,Vertrees,et al., 2008,Radtke,et al., 2011). The absence or presence of this host-associated factor in anin vitromucosal model can impact the outcome of aP. aeruginosainfectious disease study. The flagellum ofP. aeruginosabinds carbohydrate structures of mucins (such as MUC1), which enhancesP. aeruginosaadhesion (Carnoy,et al., 1994,Arora,et al., 1998,Lillehoj,et al., 2001,Lillehoj,et al., 2002,Mitchell,et al., 2002,Lu,et al., 2006). The presence of an apical mucus layer was shown to increase growth and/or adherence ofP. aeruginosacompared to the same model in which the mucus layer was removed (Worlitzsch,et al., 2002,Garnett,et al., 2013). These data further indicate the importance of mucus when studyingP. aeruginosavirulence traits. Since most ΔF508-CFTR mutant epithelial cell lines do not produce mucus or only limited amounts under currently tested culture conditions (Moreau-Marquis,et al., 2008), the combined role of the airway epithelium and the distinct CF mucus composition has not been extensively studied. Therefore, developingin vitrocell culture models that mimic the differentiated CF host epithelium and the associated mucus layer are of interest to the field. Mimicking thein vivomucociliary clearance is also of interest when choosing a model to studyP. aeruginosapathogenesis, whether it is in the context of a healthy population or of an underlying disease. Herewith, it needs to be taken into consideration that certain diseases are characterized by dysfunctional cilia. In patients with CF, the impaired or absent mucociliary clearance is believed to be at least in part causative for the susceptibility toP. aeruginosainfections. In addition, other chronic obstructive pulmonary disorders, immotile ciliary disorders, and physical injury (e.g., insertion of tracheal tubes, suction catheters, bronchoscopes) can result in impaired or absent ciliary function, and these patients frequently suffer from acute or chronicP. aeruginosainfections (Lieberman, 2003,Sagel,et al., 2011). Also, the ciliary beat frequency may vary depending on the location in the respiratory system (Zhao,et al., 2011). Therefore, the need for functional cilia in a lung tissue culture model largely depends on the disease studied and the experimental question being addressed. WhileP. aeruginosawas shown not to adhere to ciliated epithelial cells (Ramphal & Pyle, 1983,Plotkowski,et al., 1991,Woodworth,et al., 2008), ciliary beat frequency might affect the adherence ofP. aeruginosa, with a higher beat frequency leading to lower adherence (Zhao,et al., 2011). These findings highlight the importance of mimicking mucociliary clearancein vitro. Most publications describing the effect ofP. aeruginosaand its virulence factors (such as lectins, rhamnolipids, proteases and phenazines) on ciliary function have used primary respiratory epithelium grown as ALI or IVOCs (Wilson,et al., 1985,Hingley,et al., 1986,Hingley,et al., 1986,Munro,et al., 1989,Read,et al., 1992,Bajolet-Laudinat,et al., 1994). Indeed, these models contain ciliated cells at ratios similar to the respiratory mucosa. However, since cilia are already severely damaged after 2 hours of exposure toP. aeruginosain IVOCs (Plotkowski,et al., 1991), it is challenging to assess the long-term role of cilia in the pathogenesis of this microorganism using currently availablein vivo-like cell culture models. In this regard, it could be of interest to add antibiotics (such as bacitracin, clindamycin, gramicidin and roxithromycin) to the culture medium, since these agents were shown to partially counteractP. aeruginosa-induced effects on ciliary beat frequency (Mallants,et al., 2008). Multicellular complexity – The host and its indigenous microbiota Mostin vitrocell culture models used to date for studying theP. aeruginosainfectious disease process were comprised of one cell type, whether that is a single cell line or primary cells. However, interactions between multiple cell types are necessary to mediate antimicrobial defense and inflammatory reactions normally observed in mucosal tissues. Therefore, using a series of hierarchical models with increasing complexity can help dissect molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis, and replicate thein vivoinfectious disease process more closely (Schmeichel & Bissell, 2003,Griffith & Swartz, 2006,Grandel,et al., 2009,Barrila,et al., 2010,Crabbé,et al., 2011). Two-dimensional monolayers of various epithelial cell lines typically result in a homogenous cell population of one cell type, while RWV-derived 3-D aggregates of these cell lines exhibit phenotypes of multiple cell types (Barrila,et al., 2010). For example, RWV-derived models of intestinal epithelium contained populations of enterocytes, M-like cells, Paneth cells and goblet cells, which represent four out of five major cell types in thein vivoparental tissue (Nickerson,et al., 2001,Honer zu Bentrup,et al., 2006,Radtke,et al., 2011). ALI cultures of primary respiratory epithelium generate basal, goblet and ciliated cells (Zulianello,et al., 2006), but do not recapitulate the more than forty epithelial cell types in the lung (Rock & Hogan, 2011). Therefore, the collective role of multiple cell types, including innate immune and other cell populations, and their interactions, are not considered using availablein vitrocell culture models. IVOCs offer an interesting alternative since in theory all cells from the biopsy region are present in the model (Middleton,et al., 2003). However, the limited lifespan of immune cells such as lymphocytes in these models are a limitation of IVOCs when attempting to replicate thein vivomulticellular complexity (Farley,et al., 1986,Forsgren,et al., 1994). Reconstituting the entire functional cell population of a parental tissue in anin vitrosetting is challenging. Challenges include (i) finding an appropriate medium type that enables growth of all cell types simultaneously, (ii) obtaining relevant 3-D organization of all cell types relative to each other, (iii) maintaining viability and physiologically relevant ratios of each respective cell type, (iv) incorporating appropriate physical forces, and (v) incorporating the relevant ECM composition required to supportin vivo-like function of tissue-like constructs. Therefore, existing model systems have co-cultured two to three different cell types, mostly epithelial cells with neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes, macrophages, or lymphocytes, when investigating bacterial pathogenesis and host innate immunity in response to infection (reviewed by (Duell,et al., 2011)). Inclusion of immune cells such as macrophages or neutrophils are relevant given their generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, and cytokines, which affectP. aeruginosaviability and expression of clinically important virulence factors (Mathee,et al., 1999,Forman & Torres, 2002,Wu,et al., 2005). Limited available literature incorporated multiple cell types of mucosal tissues in anin vitromodel to studyP. aeruginosapathogenesis. A RWV-derived 3-D co-culture model of alveolar epithelial cells and functional macrophages demonstrated that epithelial cells could protect macrophages from the cytotoxic effects of the quorum sensing molecule 3-oxo-C12HSL (Crabbé,et al., 2011), presumably by enzymatic degradation (Chun,et al., 2004,Ozer,et al., 2005). A recent study by Tanget al.showed that co-culturing lung epithelial cells with wild type (but not CFTR knockout) lymphocytes affects bicarbonate secretion by CFTR, which in turn enhances the killing ofP. aeruginosa(Tang,et al., 2012). Using a Transwell model of wild type or ΔF508-CFTR primary airway cells, Farbermanet al. showed thatP. aeruginosa-induced expression of CXC chemokines could attract neutrophils from the basolateral to apical surface more efficiently in CF cells (Farberman,et al., 2011). While the full potential of co-culture models remains to be explored, these studies highlight that mimicking the multicellular complexity of thein vivoparental tissue can provide novel insights inP. aeruginosapathogenesis, and can help dissect the role of each cell type and their interactions in the outcome of disease. Multicellular complexity of mucosal tissues also encompasses the thousands of microbial species that colonize the mucosal epithelium in health and disease. With the reciprocal interactions between the host and microbiome, and their key role in innate immunity, it has become increasingly clear that the indigenous microbiota are important in the infectious disease process (Chu & Mazmanian, 2013). Since the microbiota is involved in tissue differentiation and function, such as epithelial barrier function, mucus production, innate immune cell activation (Kau,et al., 2011,Han,et al., 2012,Holmes,et al., 2012,Lozupone,et al., 2012,Eloe-Fadrosh & Rasko, 2013), incorporating microbial communities when modelingin vivo P. aeruginosainfections is a logical consideration. As with building the host multicellular complexity, challenges arise with developingin vitrocell culture models that mimic thein vivomicrobiome. These include the 70% as of yet unculturable bacteria in the human body, creating the right environment to maintain relevant ratios of community members (without having the faster growing organisms taking over the community), and maintaining host viability in the presence of large numbers of oxygen/nutrient-consuming organisms. To date, limited studies have incorporated host-associated microbial consortia inin vitromodels, but we anticipate that future developments will further unveil the importance of the microbiome in host-pathogen interactions byP. aeruginosa.In vitromodels of the microbiome are of particular importance since findings from animal models do not always translate to humans (Kau,et al., 2011). Other host factors altered during disease In this section, additional examples of disease-associated changes in the mucosal epithelium microenvironment that were found to alter theP. aeruginosainfectious disease process usingin vitrocell culture models are discussed, i.e. iron, oxygen, pH and nutrients.Ironlevels are increased in the CF lung environment (reviewed by (Reid,et al., 2007)), which is reflected in ΔF508-CFTR bronchial epithelial cells (Moreau-Marquis,et al., 2008). These enhanced iron levels resulted in higher host-associatedP. aeruginosabiofilm formation compared to wild type CFTR cells (Moreau-Marquis,et al., 2008), which could be prevented by using a combination of iron chelators and tobramycin (Moreau-Marquis,et al., 2009). Another host-associated factor that plays a role inP. aeruginosapathogenesis ishypoxia. Hypoxic growth conditions, associated with surgical injury in the intestinal tract, triggers production of the PA-I lectin inP. aeruginosaby soluble and contact-mediated factors released by intestinal epithelial cells (Kohler,et al., 2005). Similarly, hypoxic conditions in the context of CF lung disease were suggested to affect internalization ofP. aeruginosainto different lung epithelial cell lines (Schaible,et al., 2013). However,Schaibleet al.used non-polarized 2-D monolayers of lung epithelial cells that do not form tight junctions. Since reduced oxygen levels increase tight junction formation and polarization, this could have affectedP. aeruginosainternalization (see section on Junctional complex) (Kohler,et al., 2005,Hirota,et al., 2010,Olson,et al., 2011). ThepHof CF mucus has been shown to be lower than normal secretions (Coakley,et al., 2003,Song,et al., 2006), and could be correlated to differences in bicarbonate secretion by the epithelial cells (Paradiso,et al., 2003,Quinton, 2010). Lower pH levels in airway surface liquid reducedP. aeruginosakilling, presumably through inactivation of pH-sensitive antimicrobials (Pezzulo,et al., 2012). Finally,nutritional factorssuch as elevated basolateral glucose (CF-related diabetes) was shown to stimulate apical growth ofP. aeruginosa, and this effect was more pronounced in CF airway epithelial cells (Garnett,et al., 2013). Additional host microenvironmental factors in mucosal tissues, such as changes in viscoelastic stretch forces during lung disease, are of interest to replicate inin vitrocell/tissue models when studyingP. aeruginosapathogenesis and have to our knowledge not yet been addressed. In vitrocell culture models have layed the foundation for various novel antimicrobial approaches, of which some were tested in the clinic (Kohler,et al., 2010,Hoiby, 2011,Doring,et al., 2012). However, most of these new approaches againstP. aeruginosahave failed during clinical trials, hereby reiterating the complexity of host physiology in health and disease. This reality emphasizes the need to develop and focus research efforts towards more differentiated physiologically relevant cell culture models. Appropriately representing the human host in a cell culture model is essential to capture complex reciprocal and dynamic interactions between the host, its microenvironment, and the pathogen, which govern the outcome of the infection process. With regard toin vitrocell culture models for studyingP. aeruginosapathogenesis, areas that need improvement include (i) enhancing host cell viability uponP. aeruginosainfection (especially in the context of chronic biofilm and adaptation studies), (ii) increasing the multicellular complexity (including immune cells and members of the indigenous microbiota), (iii) incorporating relevant ECM proteins, (iv) reconciling paracrine, endocrine and cellular factors, and (v) integrating physical forces to mimic multi-organ signaling and interactions that naturally occur within the context of the specific tissue microenvironment of interest. On the other hand, researchers currently have state-of-the-art, simplified models available that mimic the minimal functional unit of the differentiated tissuein vivoand remain to be fully explored forP. aeruginosapathogenesis and drug design. In this regard, detailed knowledge of thein vivocharacteristics of a givenin vitromodel is key to understanding whether a specific model system is suitable to answer the experimental question being asked, and to accurately understand the data gathered and extrapolate these to thein vivodisease process. With our continuously expanding understanding of the host microenvironmental factors that contribute to disease byP. aeruginosa, and our knowledge database and bioengineering abilities,in vitromodel systems can and will continue to be improved to reconcile more physiological traits. Hence, antimicrobial therapies can be designed that are effective against the host-associatedP. aeruginosaphenotype, and function in the unique, and sometimes chemically challengingin vivoconditions. Applying these valuablein vitroplatforms to studyP. aeruginosapathogenesis will increase the translation of research findings from bench to clinic.
