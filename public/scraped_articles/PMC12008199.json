  "content": "Mechanosensing antagonizes ethylene signaling to promote root gravitropism in rice Received 2024 Oct 25; Accepted 2025 Apr 7; Collection date 2025. Root gravitropism relies on gravity perception by the root cap and requires tightly regulated phytohormone signaling. Here, we isolate a rice mutant that displays root coiling in hydroponics but normal gravitropic growth in soil. We identifyCOILING ROOT IN WATER 1(CRW1) encoding an ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3)-BINDING F-BOX PROTEIN (OsEBF1) as the causative gene for the mutant phenotype. We show that the OsCRW1-EIN3 LIKE 1 and 2 (OsEIL1/2)-ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR 82 (OsERF82) module controls the production of reactive oxygen species in the root tip, subsequently impacting root cap stability, polar localization of PIN-FORMED 2 (OsPIN2), symmetric distribution of auxin, and ultimately gravitropic growth of roots. The OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 ethylene signaling module is effectively impeded by applying gentle mechanical resistance to root tips, including growing in water-saturated paddy soil. We further show that mechanosensing-induced calcium signaling is required and sufficient for antagonizing the ethylene signaling pathway. This study has revealed previously unanticipated interplay among ethylene, auxin, and mechanosensing in the control of plant gravitropism. Subject terms:Plant signalling, Tropism, Plant hormones This study demonstrated that amplified ethylene signaling impairs gravitropic growth of rice roots by affecting root cap stability and OsPIN2 polar localization, whereas mechanosensing-induced calcium signaling antagonizes ethylene signaling to safeguard gravitropism. The terrestrial colonization of plants is a critical milestone in the Earth’s evolution history, dramatically increasing the productivity of organic carbon on land to support highly diverse ecosystems1,2. The emergence of roots with a gravitropic growth pattern is a critical evolution for land plants, enabling them to anchor in the soil and absorb water and nutrients3. Root gravitropism features perception of gravity by the root cap and directional growth regulation mediated by auxin4. In gravity-oriented roots, symmetrical distribution of auxin in root tips maintain symmetrical growth5. When root growth deviates from the direction of gravity, the amyloplasts in the columella cells of the root cap rapidly sink to the plasma membrane at the bottom, triggering the activation of gravity response via LAZY proteins6,7. Such response entails relocation of the auxin exporter PIN-FORMED (PIN) in the cells and redistribution of auxin8–10, thus promoting asymmetric auxin flow and asymmetric cell growth to bend the root tip to the gravity direction11. Mutations in auxin transporters and gravity-signaling-related proteins often lead to defective root gravitropism during vertical growth, such as root tips growing toward random directions7,12,13, wavy roots14, and enlarged root angles15,16. The gaseous plant hormone ethylene plays crucial roles in plant development, senescence, and stress resistance17,18. Ethylene biosynthesis and signaling are induced by specific conditions or stresses, including flooding, drought, low temperatures, and pathogens18. Ethylene signaling pathway starts with ethylene receptors in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane19–21and ends with gene regulation in the nucleus22–24. In the nucleus, the core ethylene response transcription factors ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3)/ EIN3-Like proteins (EILs) activate the transcription of specific downstream genes in response to ethylene-inducing stress events25,26. When the stress signal fades and the ethylene level goes down, EIN3/EILs are degraded by the EIN3-BINDING F-box protein 1/2 (EBF1/2) mediated ubiquitination/proteasome pathway27,28. Although ethylene is indispensable for plants, high level of ethylene is adverse for root growth29. In compacted soil, diffusion of ethylene away from roots is limited, resulting in the accumulation of ethylene and inhibition of root penetration into the soil30. Ethylene inhibits root elongation by interacting with other plant hormones, such as auxin and abscisic acid31. For example, excess ethylene enhances auxin biosynthesis and promotes Auxin Response Factors (ARFs)-mediated transcriptional regulation to affect cell wall composition, thereby limiting the elongation of root cells32,33. Excess ethylene also weakens root gravitropic response by affecting auxin biosynthesis34,35. In addition, some auxin signaling and transport mutants exhibit both defective gravitropic phenotypes and insensitivity to ethylene36,37. However, the specific mechanism whereby ethylene signaling controls gravitropic growth remains unclear. In this study, we isolated an intriguing rice mutant that displays root coiling in hydroponic culture but normal gravitropic growth in soil. The mutated gene represents a loss-of-function allele for the EIN3-binding F-box protein OsCRW1/OsEBF1, leading to overaccumulation of the OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 and amplified ethylene signaling. We show that OsEIL1/2 act on the ethylene response factor OsERF82, which subsequently regulates the transcription of several genes involved in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Overaccumulation of ROS in the root tip leads to premature loss of the root cap structure, impaired polar localization of OsPIN2 and auxin distribution, resulting in severely impaired gravitropism. In the soil-grown plants, however, gravitropism is restored in a mechanosensing-induced calcium signaling-dependent manner, revealing an intricate regulation of gravitropism by crosstalk between ethylene signaling and mechanosensing. crw1roots coil in water but not in soil Fig. 1.crw1shows defective gravitropism when grown in water but not in soil. crw1exhibits smaller root cap, asymmetric auxin distribution and defective gravitropic response in hydroponic InArabidopsis thaliana, symmetrical auxin distribution in the root tip is maintained by the auxin exporter PIN2, which is polarly localized on the top of the root epidermal cells to allow the shootward flow of auxin from the root tip12. This pattern of polar localization is conserved in seed plants3. To examine the localization of OsPIN2 in the root tip, we introducedOsPIN2-GFPdriven by its native promoter (pOsPIN2::OsPIN2-GFP) into WT andcrw1by crossing. OsPIN2-GFP was polarly localized in the epidermal cells in WT, whereas such polarity was lost incrw1(Fig.1h), which is consistent with the asymmetric auxin distribution observed incrw1root tips.

Gentle mechanical resistance on the root tip rescues the root coiling phenotype ofcrw1. Mechanosensing rescuingcrw1phenotype requires calcium signaling in the root cap Fig. 7. Mechanosensing induced Ca2+signaling antagonizes ethylene signaling to maintain root gravitropism incrw1. The root coiling phenotype in hydroponics occurs in natural rice accessions Ethylene plays a critical role in plant growth, development and resistance to multiple biotic and abiotic stresses. Because ethylene biosynthesis fluctuates widely under the influence of changing environments18,51, its effect on gravitropic growth of roots must be tightly regulated. In this study, by dissecting the genetic basis for the root coiling phenotype in the rice mutantcrw1, we uncovered the molecular module of OsCRW1 (OsEBF1)-OsEIL1/OsEIL2-OsERF82-ROS that connects ethylene signaling to gravitropism in rice roots (Fig.8). Furthermore, by addressing why growing in soft solid media rescued root coiling phenotype ofcrw1, we discovered an unexpected role of root cap mechanosensing in limiting excessive ethylene signaling, thereby safeguarding gravitropic growth of rice roots (Fig.8). Fig. 8. A model of OsCRW1 and mechanosensing inhibiting ethylene signaling to maintain root gravitropism. The presence of OsCRW1 and mechanosensing of root tips maintains root gravitropism in soil. OsCRW1 and the mechanosensing induced Ca2+signaling inhibit the ethylene signaling module of OsEIL1/OsEIL2-OsERF82 to control ROS homeostasis in root tips, consequently maintaining the structural stability of root cap and polar localization of OsPIN2, ultimately ensuring gravitropism in rice roots. Some components of this Figure were creased with Adobe Illustrator (https://helpx.adobe.com/cn/support/illustrator.html). The gravitropic growth of roots depends on the perception of gravity by the root cap and the symmetric distribution of auxin in the root tip. The former requires amyloplast as the gravity responder to transmit the gravity signal via LAZY proteins6,7, and the latter is tightly controlled by polar-localized auxin transporters such as PIN212. Mutations of critical genes in auxin transport (e.g.pin212,aux113,eir136), amyloplast synthesis52,53and gravity signaling6,7cause plant roots to display defective gravitropic behaviors during vertical growth. The impact of ethylene signaling on root gravitropism appears to vary among plant species. InArabidopsis, loss-of-function mutations of the key genes that control ethylene biosynthesis or signal transduction, includingETO1,CTR1, EIN2,andEIN3, did not affect gravitropic growth of roots35. In contrast, disruption ofEIL1andEIN2homologous genes in rice or maize resulted in enlarged angle of adventitious roots when grown in hydroponic, indicating a weakened gravitropism35. In the present study, we found that loss of function of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 led to coiling of both seminal and adventitious roots of rice in hydroponic culture, indicative of a severe disruption of gravitropism. The F-box proteins EBFs bind to EIN3 and EIL proteins, thus promoting their degradation via a ubiquitin/proteasome pathway27,28. The loss of function of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 led to overaccumulation of OsEIL1/2 proteins in rice roots and consequently amplified ethylene signaling. We identified OsERF82, a hitherto unreported ethylene response factor, as the downstream target of OsEIL1/2. OsERF82 transcriptionally regulates the expression of several genes involved in ROS production, includingOsRBOHHand several Class III peroxidase genes. The elevated expression ofOsERF82incrw1enhanced the expression of these ROS-related genes, resulting in an excessive accumulation of ROS in the root tip. Apart from OsERF82, it is possible that other target genes regulated by OsEIL1 may also play a small role in the coiling root phenotype ofcrw1. We found that excessive ROS accumulation in the root tip ofcrw1accelerates root cap sloughing through programed cell death, thereby reducing the number of amyloplast and weakening gravity perception. Furthermore, excessive accumulation of ROS disrupted the symmetrical auxin distribution in the root tip by impairing the polar localization of OsPIN2. This is consistent with an earlier finding that application of exogenous H2O2inhibits vesicle-mediated trafficking and polar localization of AtPIN2 inArabidopsis54. Disrupted polar localization of OsPIN2 and reduced root cap stability together explain the severe loss of gravitropism incrw1roots. Thus, limiting ethylene signaling in the nucleus is critical for the normal gravitropic growth of rice roots. Although growing in compacted soil may increase the ethylene level in roots due to restricted gas diffusion30, we found that gentle mechanical resistance that rice roots typically encounter in water-saturated paddy soil or other soft solid media enhances the degradation of OsEIL1/OsEIL2 and thus dampens the excessive ethylene signaling incrw1, leading to rescue of the root coiling phenotype. The mechanical resistance required to antagonize ethylene signaling amplification is mild (penetration resistance ≥ 34 Pa), consistent with the soft nature of submerged paddy soil that rice plants are adapted to. This level of mechanical resistance is more than an order of magnitude lower than in water unsaturated and compacted soil used in the study of Pandey et al.30. Strong mechanical resistance can inhibit root elongation or change the direction of root growth. For example, root tips stop growing when encountering three-dimensional impenetrable compactness30, change direction to avoid a flat obstacle55, or grow in a wavy or circular manner on an impenetrable agar slope56–58. A recent study showed thatArabidopsisroots growing on the agar surface can produce different growth paths in response to subtle changes of mechanical forces59. In the present study, mild mechanical resistance did not affect the normal root growth of WT but was sufficient to ensure gravitropic root growth ofcrw1and coiling-root accessions, suggesting that mechanical resistance below the level that inhibits root growth can be sensed by rice roots to help safeguard gravitropism. Such an effect has not been reported before but is consistent with previous findings that plants can sensitively perceive different strengths of mechanical stimuli from nature and produce rapid thigmonastic responses or gradual morphogenetic alterations60,61. We found that the rescue of root gravitropism incrw1by gentle mechanical resistance requires Ca2+signaling in the root cap. In the absence of OsCRW1/OsEBF1, mechanosensing-induced Ca2+signaling safeguards the gravitropic growth ofcrw1roots by suppressing the accumulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2. How enhanced Ca2+signaling in the root cap prevents over-accumulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 remains unclear and warrants further investigation. The observation that knockout ofOsEBF2incrw1did not affect the rescue of the root coiling phenotype by gentle mechanical resistance suggests that enhanced Ca2+signaling promotes the degradation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 proteins in an OsCRW1/OsEBF1 and OsEBF2-independent mechanism. Mechanosensing-induced Ca2+signaling may play a particularly important role in keeping ethylene signaling in check under stress conditions, which suppress the translation of OsCRW1/OsEBF143, or in natural rice accessions with a weak or loss-of-function OsCRW1. On the other hand, although OsCRW1 may be dispensable in uncompacted soil, it is needed to restrict excessive ethylene signaling in compacted soil to reduce the inhibition on root growth. Interestingly, we observed that the root coiling phenotype was present in some natural rice accessions when grown in hydroponics, and the phenotype was apparently related to the transcription level ofOsCRW1/OsEBF1. Some of the coiling-root accessions had aOsCRW1/OsEBF1transcript level similar to those in the straight-root accessions, suggesting that variation in the protein level or in the coding sequence may also be involved. Growing these rice accessions in soft paddy soil also restored their gravitropic growth. A lower level of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 may be advantageous for stress resistance because of enhanced ethylene signaling, especially when root gravitropic growth can be safeguarded by mechanosensing. Several stress response pathways were enriched in the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) betweencrw1and WT (Fig.3b). Among these DEGs, at least 24 genes that were upregulated incrw1have been previously reported to be involved in the resistance to drought, salinity, cold, or diseases (Supplemental Fig.31). Evolution of land plants is accompanied with expansion of genes involved in hormone signaling and transcription factors62. Our study shows that mechanosensing induced Ca2+signaling plays an unexpected role in balancing the ethylene-auxin signaling pathways for gravitropic growth of plants in soil. Plant materials and growth conditions The japonica rice cultivar Zhonghua11 was used as the wild type (WT) for all experiments. An ethyl methylsulfonate (EMS)-mutagenized population (M3 generation) was used for root phenotype screening. Transgenic plant materials were generated as described below. Seeds were surface sterilized with 15% NaClO for 30 min, washed with sterilized water, and placed in a 37 °C incubator for 2 days to promote germination. Germinated seeds were transferred to hydroponic boxes, soil culture boxes or agar plates to grow depending on the requirements of different experiments. Experiments were carried out in a growth room with the following conditions: temperature 28 °C ± 0.5 °C, humidity 50%–60%, 12-h photoperiod with a light intensity of 100 mmol of photons m−2s−1. WT and mutant were also grown in two paddy fields (Nanjing and Sanya) to maturity. Agronomic traits, including plant height, tiller number, percentage of filled grains, 1000-grain weight and grain biomass per plant, were determined at plant maturity. Plasmid construction and plant transformation Germinated seeds were placed on a net floating on deionized water for ten days and then transferred to ½ strength Kimura B nutrient solution66for different durations according to the requirements of experiments. The nutrient solution was changed every three days, and the pH was maintained at 5.6-5.8. To investigate the effects of nutrients, pH, light and dissolved oxygen level on root phenotypes, we grew seedlings ofcrw1and WT in hydroponic boxes filled with deionized water or nutrient solution at the ¼ and ½ strength, different solution pH (from 4 to 8), light condition (12 h/12 h light/dark or 24 h dark), with or without aeration treatment (dissolved oxygen level 12.45 and 5.36 mg/L, respectively). To compare the root phenotypes grown in water and solid media, we grew germinated seedlings in water (pH = 5.6-5.8), water-saturated paddy soil, water-saturated vermiculite or water-saturated peat pellet for 2-10 days. Dissolved oxygen concentrations in hydroponic solution and soil were measured using a dissolved oxygen probe. In some experiments, paddy soil was packed at a normal (1.0 g cm−3) and a high (1.6 g cm−3) bulk density. The penetration resistance of soil and other solid growth media was measured by using a soil compactness tester. To investigate the effect of mechanical resistance on root phenotypes, we grew seedlings of WT andcrw1in agar-solidified medium with 0.3, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0 or 1.2% (w/v) agar in square Petri dishes. The top 2-cm agar was removed and the emerged seminal roots (1-2 mm) of WT andcrw1were embedded in the agar and allowed to grow vertically for 2 to 3 days. To apply resistance on root tips, we made polystyrene foam spherical pellets (1 mm diameter) with a slit in the middle, placed root tip into the slit and grew seedlings in deionized water for 2-3 days. For chemical treatment, L-Kynurenine (L-Kyn, 10 μM), 1-Methylcyclopropene (1-MCP, 10 μM), 1-Aminocyclopropanecarboxylic Acid (ACC, 1 μM), N-acetylcysteine (NAC, 200 μM), diphenyleneiodonium (DPI, 50 nM), salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM, 10 μM) or LaCl3(100 μM) were added to deionized water or agar medium according to different experiments. Each genotype and treatment had at least 3 biological replicates, 7-12 plants per replicate in short-term hydroponic experiments, 3-6 plants per replicate in long-term hydroponic experiments, 3-4 plants per replicate in petri dish experiments, and 7-12 plants per replicate in soil-vermiculite experiments. To clone the causal gene responsible for the coiling-root phenotype ofcrw1, we backcrossedcrw1to WT (Zhonghua11) to generate F1progenies. F1progenies were selfed to generate F2progenies. DNA was extracted from 50 F2plants showing the coiling-root phenotype in water and mixed in equal proportions to generate a pooled genomic DNA ofcrw1. A pooled genomic DNA of WT was prepared in the same way. Genome sequencing was performed using Illumina Hiseq4000 at 50× and 30× coverage forcrw1and WT, respectively), generating 150-bp paired-end reads. After removing the adapter sequences and low-quality reads, clean reads were mapped to the reference genome sequence (OsNipponbare-Reference-RGAP7, MSU) using BWA software67, followed by SNP-calling using GATK software68. Causative variant were calculated using the MutMap SNP-index method69and candidate SNPs were identified. Tissue expression pattern analysis ofOsCRW1 Transgenic rice plants expressingproOsCRW1::GUSwere grown in water for 3 days before being used for histochemical staining for the GUS activity in roots, and in nutrient solution for different durations for GUS staining of leaves and reproductive organs. Roots and other tissues were incubated with a GUS staining solution for 2 h at 37 °C, transferred to 70% ethanol overnight, and then photographed under an ultra-depth stereoscopic microscope (Leica, DVM6a). Transgenic rice plants expressingproOsCRW1::GFPwere grown in water for 3 days and roots were cut and were placed on a slide for fluorescence imaging under a macro zoom microscope (Carl Zeiss, MVX10). The GFP fluorescence was observed at 505-560 nm for emission and 488 nm for excitation. Subcellular localization of OsCRW1 and OsERF82 To generate constructs ofGFP-OsCRW1orGFP-OsERF82driven by the CaMV35S promoter (pro35S::GFP-OsCRW1orpro35S::GFP-OsERF82), we amplified the full-length CDS ofOsCRW1orOsERF82from the cDNA of Zhonghua11 and introduced the CDS into the HindIII/EcoRI site of thepSAT6-GFP-Cvector. The fragments ofpro35S::GFP-OsCRW1orpro35S::GFP-OsERF82were isolated from thepSAT6-GFP-Cvector by PI-PspI endonuclease and introduced into the PI-PspI site of thepRCS2vector. The plasmids were transformed into rice protoplasts for transient expression70. Protoplasts were isolated from rice stems and labeled with the nucleus marker 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for co-localization. The GFP and DAPI fluorescence was observed under a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, LSM780) at 505-560 nm and 400-470 nm for emission, respectively, and at 488 nm and 360 nm for excitation, respectively. Root cap size observation and amyloplast staining Root tips from two-day-old seedlings were cut and stained with 0.1% (w/v) basic fuchsin solution for 6 h. Root tips were resin-embedded, sectioned according to a previous method71, and photographed under a microscope to reveal the root cap size. Root tips from two-day-old seedlings were cut, stained with 5% (v/v) Lugol’s solution for 1 minute, washed with distilled water, and photographed under a microscope for the observation of the amyloplasts in the root caps. Lugol’s stock solution was prepared by dissolving 5% (m/v) iodine in 10% (m/v) KI solution. Fluorescence imaging of OsPIN2 localization, auxin response, cytosolic Ca2+and ROS Plants expressingproOsPIN2::OsPIN2-GFPor the reporter gene for auxin response (DR5rev::VENUS) or for cytosolic Ca2+(NES-YC3.6, driven by the maizeUbiquitinpromoter) were grown under different growth conditions or treatments for two to three days. Root tips were cut and immediately observed under a confocal laser-scanning microscope. The GFP fluorescence was observed as described above. The VENUS fluorescence was observed at 520-550 nm for emission and 515 nm for excitation. For NES-YC3.6 detection, the measurement of cpVENUS/ECFP ratio shifts was based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer according to a previous method50. The ECFP fluorescence was observed at 460-490 nm for emission and 415 nm for excitation. For detection of ROS, roots were incubated with 10 μM H2DCFDA for 10 mins, washed with deionized water, and the ROS fluorescence was observed under a confocal laser-scanning microscope at 505-560 nm and 488 nm for emission and excitation, respectively65. The TUNEL assay was used to detect the programed cell death of root caps. Root tips were sampled and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 mins, followed by washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Root tips were immersed in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 for 5 mins, washed with PBS, and incubated in the TUNEL detection solution (Beyotime, China) at 37 °C for 1 h. The TUNEL fluorescence was observed under a confocal laser-scanning microscope at 515-565 nm and 488 nm for emission and excitation, respectively. The Y2H assay was used to detect the interaction between OsCRW1 and OsEIL1 or OsEIL2.The full-length CDS ofOsCRW1was introduced into the EcoRI/BamHI site of thepGBKT7vector to generate thepGBKT7-OsCRW1vector expressing fusion proteins containing the yeast GAL4 transcription binding domain (BD). The full-length CDS ofOsEIL1orOsEIL2was introduced into the EcoRI/BamHI site ofpGADT7to generate thepGADT7-OsEIL1andpGADT7-EIL2vector expressing fusion proteins containing the yeast GAL4 transcription activation domain (AD). ThepGBKT7-OsCRW1plasmid andpGADT7-OsEIL1orpGADT7-OsEIL2plasmid were transformed into the Y2H Gold yeast strain alone or in pairs.pGBKT7-53together withpGADT7-Twere transformed as a positive control, andpGBKT7-lamtogether withpGADT7-Twere transformed as a negative control. The yeast colonies were cultured in Synthetic Dropout (SD) liquid medium (-Trp, -Leu) to an optical density (OD) of 0.8. The serially diluted yeast solution was inoculated on a double-deficient SD medium (-Trp, -Leu) and a quadruple-deficient SD medium (-Trp, -Leu, -His, -Ade, +X-α-gal) for growth. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation The full-length CDS ofOsCRW1was fused to the vector ofpDONR221-P3P2, and the full-length CDS ofOsEIL1andOsEIL2were fused to the vector ofpDONR221-P1P4by gateway cloning, and then were transferred intopBiFCt-2in1-NNvector alone or in pairs by LR clonase to fuse with the N- and C-terminal fragments of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). The final plasmids were introduced intoAgrobacterium tumefaciensstrain GV3101. Bacterial cultures of the test combinations and controls were infiltrated into tobacco (Latin name) leaves. Two days after infiltration, the YFP signal was detected under confocal laser microscopy at 520-550 nm and 515 nm for emission and excitation, respectively. For immunological detection of OsEIL1-Flag, OsEIL2-Flag and OsActin in the roots of WT andcrw1, total soluble proteins were extracted from 15-20 seminal roots with 1 ml plant protein extraction buffer. Proteins were denatured by heating at 95oC for 10 min in a metal-bath and separated on 12% SDS-PAGE. Subsequently, proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane and immunoblots were probed with the following antibodies in the TBST solution (100 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1%(v/v) Tween 20, pH=7.4) with 5% non-fat dry milk. A mouse anti-Flag antibody (Invitrogen, MA1-91878, 1:5000 dilution) and a mouse anti-Actin antibody (Beyotime, AA128, 1:5000 dilution) were used as the primary antibodies and HPR-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Beyotime, A0216, 1:5000 dilution) was used as the secondary antibody. Chemiluminescence was performed using ECL Western Blotting Substrate (Beyotime, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The full-length CDS ofOsEIL1,OsEIL2orOsERF82was introduced into the EcoRI/BamHI site of thepGADT7vector to express fusion proteins containing the yeast GAL4 transcription activation domain. To detect the binding of OsEIL1/2 with the EIN3-binding site (EBS, ATGTA) on the promoter ofOsERF82, we introduced three copies of EBS into the SmaI/SalI site of thepAbAivector. A random mutation sequence in EBS was designed (EBSmut, CGAGA) and used as a negative control. To detect the binding of OsERF82 with the GCC-box (GCCGCC), G-box (CACGTG) and DRE/CRT (GCCGAC) on the promoter sequence ofOsRBOHHand three Class IIIOsPRXgenes, we introduced three copies of DRE/CRT, GCC box and G box sequence into the SmaI/SalI site of thepAbAivector. A random mutation sequence in each potential binding site was designed (GCC-boxmut, ACCACC; G-boxmut, AACTTG; DRE/CRTmut, GTCGAA) and used as a negative control.pAbAicarrying different binding sites were transformed into Y1H Gold yeast strain to screen the proper concentration of aureobasidin A (AbA) for inhibiting transcriptional self-activation.pGADT7carryingOsEIL1orOsEIL2orOsERF82, andpAbAicarrying different sequences were co-transformed into Y1H Gold yeast strain. The yeast colonies were cultured in Leu-deficient SD liquid medium to OD of 0.8. The serially diluted yeast solution was inoculated on Leu-deficient SD medium (with or without AbA) for growth. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)- qPCR assay Transactivation activity of OsERF82 The full-length CDS ofOsERF82was introduced into the EcoRI/BamHI site of thepGBKT7vector to generate thepGBKT7-OsCRW1vector expressing fusion protein containing the yeast GAL4 transcription binding domain (BD). ThepGBKT7-OsERF82plasmid was transformed into the AH109 yeast strain.pGBKT7plasmid was transformed as a negative control. The yeast colonies were cultured in Synthetic Dropout (SD) liquid medium (-Trp) to OD = 0.8. The serially diluted yeast solution was inoculated on Trp-deficient SD medium and double-deficient SD medium (-Trp, -His, +X-α-gal) for growth. RNA sequencing was performed on roots ofcrw1and WT grown in water or in a soil-vermiculite mixture for two days. Each group contained three replicates with 15-20 plants per replicate. Total RNA was extracted using a Plant Total RNA Extraction Kit (BioTeke). The cDNA libraries were sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencing platform at Benagen Technology (Wuhan, China), and 150-bp paired-end reads were generated. For the analysis of gene expression, fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads and read counts of each unigene were calculated and normalized based on the number of uniquely positioned reads overlapping the exon regions. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using R software (v.3.5.1) with the DESeq2 package (http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html).
