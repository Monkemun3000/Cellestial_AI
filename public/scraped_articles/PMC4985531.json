Adipose tissue in bone marrow may contribute to metabolic health through its effects on local energy balance and/or its actions as an endocrine organ (1). Low bone mass is often associated with elevated bone marrow adiposity (2,3). Bone marrow contains mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) capable of differentiating into cells of the osteoblastic and adipocytic lineages (4). A reciprocal relationship between the number of mature osteoblasts and bone marrow adipocytes may occur as a consequence of differentiation of MSCs toward one lineage at the expense of the other lineage (5,6). Mechanistically, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), a transcription factor that plays a key role in regulation of adipogenesis and lipid uptake, has been implicated as a factor controlling MSC differentiation. Inhibition of PPARγ increases osteoblast differentiation while decreasing adipocyte differentiation. Osteoblast-targeted overexpression of PPARγ inhibits bone mass gain in male mice and increases ovariectomy-induced osteopenia in female mice (5). Furthermore, cultured adipocytes release factors capable of inducing osteoblast linage cells to differentiate into an adipocyte-like phenotype (7). Thus, excessive marrow adipose tissue (MAT) has the potential to directly and/or indirectly reduce bone mass by inhibiting osteoblast differentiation. As such, an increase in MAT may contribute to osteoporosis in conditions, such as menopause, skeletal disuse, alcohol abuse, and eating disorders (3,8,9). Interestingly, anorexia and obesity both result in increased MAT (10,11). Anorexia is commonly associated with reduced bone mineral density (BMD) and increased fracture risk. By contrast, being overweight is generally associated with increased BMD and reduced fracture risk. However, recent studies suggest that morbid obesity has negative effects on bone quality (12,13). Thus, it is possible that the increase in MAT plays a role in the detrimental skeletal changes associated with both extremes in body weight. Leptin-deficientob/oband leptin receptor-deficientdb/dbmice exhibit excessive MAT in long bones (16). Short-term delivery of leptin into the hypothalamus was shown to reduce peripheral fat depots as well as MAT (23,24). However, the long-term effects of increased leptin levels on MAT have not been well characterized. Hypothalamic leptin gene therapy has been shown to result in life-long reductions in body weight inob/obmice (25). The goal of the present study was to determine the long-duration effects of increased hypothalamic leptin, using recombinant adeno-associated virus leptin gene therapy (rAAV-Lep), on bone marrow adiposity in morbidly obeseob/obmice. Given that the energy density of a diet impacts weight gain and MAT levels (26), the effects of a regular and high energy density (high fat) diet were also evaluated. Experiment 1: Effects of 30 Weeks of Hypothalamic Leptin Gene Therapy on Marrow Adiposity and Cancellous Bone Histomorphometry inob/obMice Following arrival,ob/obmice were randomized by weight into four treatment groups: (1) untreated (n= 6), (2) control vector encoding green fluorescent protein (rAAV-GFP,n= 7), (3) rAAV-Lep (n= 8), or (4) pair-fed to rAAV-Lep (n= 6). The mice were maintained on standard mouse chow (LM-485, Teklad, Madison, WI, USA) and sacrificed 30 weeks following vector administration at 38–40 weeks of age. This age corresponds to a period immediately prior to a drastic increase in mortality inob/obmice – median lifespan inob/obmice is 55 weeks compared to 131 weeks in WT mice (25). The effects of treatment on hypothalamic leptin gene expression, body weight, food intake, hormone levels, organ weights, and cancellous and cortical bone architecture evaluated by microcomputed tomography in this study are detailed elsewhere (25,28). Experiment 2: Effects of 15 Weeks of Hypothalamic Leptin Gene Therapy and 8 Weeks of High-Fat Diet on Marrow Adiposity and Cancellous Bone Histomorphometry inob/obMice Experiment 2 was conducted using WT andob/obmice. Following arrival, WT mice (n= 12) were maintained on regular chow (LM-485, Teklad, Madison, WI, USA; caloric density 3.4 kcal/g, 11% of kcal from fat) until 15–17 weeks of age and then randomized by weight into two groups: (1) control (n= 3) or (2) high-fat diet (n= 9). Mice in the control group continued to consume the regular dietad libitumwhile mice in the high-fat group were placed on a high-fat diet (caloric density 4.7 kcal/g; 45% of kcal from fat, primarily from lard; Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ, USA) fedad libitum. The mice were sacrificed 8 weeks later at 23–25 weeks of age – an age corresponding to cessation of linear growth in B6 mice (27). In conjunction,ob/obmice were randomized by weight into two treatment groups: rAAV-Lep (n= 16) or control vector rAAV-GFP (n= 14). At 7 weeks post-vector administration, rAAV-GFP and rAAV-Lep mice were each divided into two groups: one group continued to consume regular diet and the other was switched to a high-fat diet as described above for WT mice. The mice were sacrificed 8 weeks later at 23–25 weeks of age (15 weeks following vector administration). The effect of the rAAV-Lep pretreatment and high-fat diet on hypothalamic leptin gene expression, body weight, food intake, organ weights, hormone levels, and cancellous and cortical bone architecture determined by microcomputed tomography are detailed elsewhere (28–30). Construction and Packaging of rAAV Vectors rAAV-leptin gene therapy and rAAV-GFP vectors were constructed and packaged as previously described (31). In brief, the vector pTR-CBA-ObEcoRI fragment of pCR-rOb containing rat leptin cDNA was subcloned into rAAV vector plasmid pAAVβGEnh after deleting theEcoRI fragment carrying the β-glucoronidase cDNA sequence. The control vector, rAAV-GFP, was similarly constructed to encode the GFP gene. For vector administration, the mice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (60 mg/kg, i.p.), placed on a Kopf stereotaxic apparatus with mouse adapter for intracerebroventricular injection, and injected intracerebroventricularly with either rAAV-Lep (9 × 107particles in 1.5 μl) or rAAV-GFP (9 × 107particles in 1.5 μl). The coordinates employed for microinjector placement in the third cerebroventricle were 0.3 mm posterior to bregma, 0.0 lateral to midline, and 4.2 mm below the dura (29). Tissue Collection and Analyses At the end of each experiment mice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (60 mg/kg; i.p.) and euthanized by exsanguination. Femora were excised, cleaned of soft tissue, and stored in 70% ethanol. Femora were prepared for histomorphometric evaluation as described (32). In brief, distal femora were dehydrated in graded increases of ethanol and xylene and embedded undecalcified in methyl methacrylate. Frontal sections (4 μm thick) were cut with a vertical bed microtome (Leica 2165) and affixed to slides precoated with a 1% gelatin solution. One section/animal was stained for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase and counterstained with toluidine blue (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) for assessment of bone and cell-based measurements. Histomorphometric data were collected using the OsteoMeasure System (OsteoMetrics, Inc., Atlanta, GA, USA). The sampling site for the distal femoral metaphysis was located 0.25–1.25 mm proximal to the growth plate and 0.1 mm from cortical bone. Cancellous bone measurements included bone area fraction (bone area/tissue area, %) and the derived architectural indices of trabecular number (mm−1), trabecular thickness (micrometer), and trabecular separation (micrometer). Measurements of MAT included overall marrow adiposity (adipose area/tissue area, %), adipocyte density (mm−2), and adipocyte size (micrometers2). Adipocytes were identified as large circular or oval-shaped cells bordered by a prominent cell membrane and lacking cytoplasmic staining due to alcohol extraction of intracellular lipids during processing. This method has been validated by fat extraction and analysis (33). Osteoblast and osteoclast perimeters were also measured and expressed as % of total bone perimeter. Osteoblasts were identified as plump cuboidal cells immediately adjacent to a thin layer of osteoid in direct contact with the bone perimeter. Osteoclasts were identified as multinucleated (two or more nuclei) cells with acid phosphatase positive (red-stained) cytoplasm in contact with the bone perimeter. Data are reported using standard two-dimensional nomenclature (34). Mean responses for Experiment 1 were compared among the untreated, rAAV-GFP, rAAV-Lep, and pair-fed groups using one-way analysis of variance. For Experiment 2, the effects of treatment and diet were assessed using two-way analysis of variance. Pairwise comparisons were made usingt-tests or the Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test. The required conditions for valid use of linear models were assessed using Levene’s test for homogeneity of variance, plots of residuals versus fitted values, normal quantile plots, and the Anderson–Darling test of normality. The Benjamini and Hochberg method (35) for maintaining the false discovery rate at 5% was used to adjust for multiple comparisons. Data analysis was performed using R version 3.3.2. Experiment 1: Effects of 30 Weeks of Hypothalamic Leptin Gene Therapy on Marrow Adiposity and Cancellous Bone Histomorphometry inob/obMice The effects of treatment on body weight and on cancellous bone in the distal femur metaphysis are shown in Table1. rAAV-Lep treatment resulted in lower body weight compared to untreated, rAAV-GFP-treated, and pair-fed mice. Significant differences in cancellous bone area fraction, trabecular number, or trabecular spacing were not detected with treatment. However, trabecular thickness was lower in rAAV-Lep-treated mice compared to untreated and rAAV-GFP-treated mice, but did not differ from pair-fedob/obmice.

Significant differences among untreated, rAAV-GFP-treated, and pair-fed mice were not detected for any of the MAT measurements.

Osteoblast perimeter (Figure2A) and osteoclast perimeter (Figure2B) were higher in rAAV-Lep-treated mice compared to untreated, rAAV-GFP-treated, and pair-fed mice. Significant differences among untreated, rAAV-GFP-treated, and pair-fed mice were not detected for either of the cellular endpoints evaluated.

Experiment 2: Effects of 15 Weeks of Hypothalamic Leptin Gene Therapy and 8 Weeks of High-Fat Diet on Marrow Adiposity and Cancellous Bone Histomorphometry inob/obMice The effects of rAAV-Lep pretreatment and high-fat diet on body weight and on cancellous bone in distal femur metaphysis are shown in Table2. Body weight was higher in WT mice fed high-fat diet compared to WT mice fed regular diet. Body weight was also higher inob/obmice fed high fat compared toob/obmice fed regular diet and rAAV-Lep treatment resulted in lower body weight. Cancellous bone area fraction, trabecular thickness, and trabecular number were higher and trabecular spacing was lower in WT mice fed high-fat diet compared to WT mice fed regular diet. rAAV-Lep treatment inob/obmice resulted in lower cancellous bone area fraction and trabecular thickness. Significant differences in trabecular number or trabecular spacing were not detected with treatment in theob/obmice. With the exception of trabecular thickness, which was lower, significant differences between WT mice and rAAV-Lep-treatedob/obmice fed regular diets were not detected for any of the remaining cancellous endpoints evaluated.

The effects of treatment on marrow adiposity in distal femur metaphysis are shown in Figure3. Marrow adiposity and adipocyte size were higher in WT mice fed high-fat diet compared to mice fed regular diet. Significant differences in adipocyte density were not detected with diet in WT mice. rAAV-Lep treatment inob/obmice resulted in lower marrow adiposity due to lower adipocyte density as well as lower adipocyte size.

Leptin-deficientob/obmice were heavier and had increased MAT in distal femur metaphysis compared to WT mice. Consumption of high-fat diet resulted in increased body weight in both WT mice andob/obmice but increased MAT and cancellous bone in WT mice only. rAAV-Lep treatment decreased MAT inob/obmice. The reduction in MAT in rAAV-Lep-treatedob/obmice was accompanied by increases in osteoblast-lined and osteoclast-lined bone perimeter but not by an increase in cancellous bone. Continuous and once daily intracerebroventricular administration of leptin were similarly effective in reducing MAT in long bones ofob/obmice (23,24,36,37). Based on lower adipocyte number and size and increased concentration of apoptosis marker caspase-3 in bone marrow adipocytes, the reduction in MAT was likely due to a combination of reduced adipocyte differentiation, increased fat oxidation, and increased adipocyte apoptosis. A similar reduction in MAT was observed following subcutaneous leptin administration (36). In normal female rats, hypothalamic delivery of rAAV-Lep was shown to maintain lower body weight, WAT weight, and serum leptin levels (2.7 ± 0.3 versus 1.0 ± 0.1 ng/ml) for at least 18 weeks following vector administration. By contrast, rAAV-Lep transiently reduced MAT; MAT levels were reduced at 5 weeks but returned to normal levels by 10 weeks following vector administration (38). Also, hypothalamic rAAV-Lep gene therapy was ineffective in lowering MAT in ovariectomized rats (39). In the present study, MAT levels in rAAV-Lep-treatedob/obmice, evaluated 15 and 30 weeks following vector administration, were much lower than age-matchedob/obcontrols and comparable to WT mice in Experiment 2. These findings suggest that (1) while very important, the physiological actions of leptin on MAT are primarily manifested at low hormone levels and (2) hyperleptinemia has little further effect on MAT. If correct, this could help explain why some studies fail to detect a relationship between blood leptin levels and MAT (1). The findings regarding the actions of leptin on MAT are remarkably similar to the actions of the hormone on bone growth, maturation, and turnover. Whereas hypothalamic rAAV-Lep gene therapy corrected the skeletal abnormalities inob/obmice, it had minimal long-term impact on bone in rodents capable of producing leptin (16,18,28,39). As previously mentioned, short-duration delivery of leptin into the hypothalamus increased bone formation (36). Similarly, hypothalamic leptin gene therapy increased serum osteocalcin levels and osteoblast perimeter in lumbar vertebra ofob/obmice (16,44). In the present study, hypothalamic leptin gene therapy increased osteoblast perimeter in distal femur metaphysis inob/obmice 30 weeks following vector administration. These findings indicate that leptin promotes higher levels of bone formation prior to and following restoration of normal body weight and bone mass inob/obmice (28). The increased cancellous bone volume fraction observed at selected skeletal sites (lumbar vertebrae) inob/obmice was initially attributed to increased bone formation, suggesting that leptin was antiosteogenic (45). However, subsequent studies consistently reported decreased bone formation inob/obmice and leptin receptor-deficientdb/dbmice, and increased bone formation following intracerebroventricular delivery of leptin, leptin gene therapy, or subcutaneous administration of leptin inob/obmice (16,37,44). Leptin signaling-deficient (ob/obanddb/db) mice have normal or increased osteoclast number but exhibit evidence for impaired osteoclast function (16,18). As a consequence, these mice exhibit impaired skeletal maturation due to defective resorption of calcified cartilage. Specifically, the high cancellous bone volume fraction represents mild osteopetrosis. In the present study inob/obmice, rAAV-Lep resulted in increased osteoclast-lined bone perimeter. Thus, the failure to detect an increase in cancellous bone volume fraction in the femur metaphysis in response to higher leptin levels is likely due to parallel increases in bone formation and bone resorption. High MAT levels inob/obmice are associated with low cancellous bone turnover (16). In the present study, rAAV-Lep resulted in increases in osteoclast-lined perimeter as well as osteoblast-lined bone perimeter and greatly reduced MAT with minimal change in cancellous bone area fraction. High MAT levels are not unique to leptin deficiency. Growth hormone deficiency in rats and mice induced by hypophysectomy or deletion of the gene for growth hormone, respectively, is also associated with high MAT and low bone turnover. In the case of growth hormone deficiency, parathyroid hormone was found to increase bone formation in hypophysectomized rats without impacting MAT levels, demonstrating that bone formation induced by bone anabolic agents is not suppressed by high levels of MAT (33). Similarly, although bone formation was increased, the absence of MAT inkitW/W-vmice did not protect against ovariectomy-induced bone loss (46). Taken together, these findings suggest that bone resorption as well as bone formation can be impacted during changes in MAT levels and interventions that target MAT may not necessarily change bone turnover balance. A positive association between body weight and bone mass was observed inob/obas well as WT mice (30,47). However, leptin appears to sensitize the skeleton to bone mechanical loading. This may explain why leptin-deficient mice have a low total bone mass even though they are morbidly obese and why the massive weight loss inob/obmice following leptin treatment is actually associated with a net increase in bone mass (28). In summary, hypothalamic leptin gene therapy maintained low MAT levels inob/obmice fed regular or high-fat diet. The reduction in MAT was accompanied by an increase in osteoblast-lined bone perimeter but not an increase in cancellous bone volume fraction. The increase in osteoclast-lined bone perimeter suggests that the increase in bone formation was matched by an increase in bone resorption. These findings provide further evidence that a deterministic model where reducing MAT will invariably lead to increased bone volume is not tenable. As a consequence, interventions targeted at reducing MAT may not be an effective strategy for increasing bone mass. Study design: SK. Data acquisition: LL, KP, and RT. Data analysis: AB.
