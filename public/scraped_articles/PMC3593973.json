  "content": "Chimeras reveal a single lipid-interface residue that controls MscL channel kinetics as well as mechanosensitivity Correspondence should be addressed to PB 214-645-6014 (Paul.Blount@utsouthwestern.edu) These authors contributed equally to this work MscL, the highly conserved bacterial mechanosensitive channel of large conductance, functionally serves as an osmotic “emergency release valve”, is among the best studied mechanosensors and a paradigm of how a channel senses and responds to membrane tension. While all homologues tested thus far encode channel activity, many show functional differences. Here we testedE. coliandS aureuschimeras and find that the periplasmic region of the protein, particularlyE. coliI49 and the equivalentS aureusF47 at the periplasmic lipid-aqueous interface of the first transmembrane domain, drastically influences both the open dwell time and threshold of channel opening. One mutant shows a severe hysteresis, confirming the importance of this residue in determining the energy barriers for channel gating. We propose that this site acts similar to a spring for a clasp knife, adjusting the resistance for obtaining and stabilizing an open or closed channel structure. The ability to detect mechanical forces is at the basis of not only the senses of touch, hearing and balance but also cardiovascular and osmotic regulation. In essence, mechanosensation is probably the oldest sense and is fundamental for many life functions. The primary way that organisms detect forces is through mechanosensitive (MS) ion channels. The best-studied mechanosensitive channels are from bacteria, and because relatively little is known of mechanosensors from higher organisms, these channels are a model for how a protein can sense and respond to mechanical forces. The mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) is a bacterial channel located in the cytoplasmic membrane that is gated by membrane tension (Blount et al., 2008a;Blount et al., 2007;Blount et al., 2008b;Booth and Blount, 2012). Although observed in the vast majority of bacterial species, the channels fromEscherichia coli(E. coli) have been the best studied. The physiological role of MscL, and members of an unrelated bacterial mechanosensitive channel family, MscS (S for small conductance), is to serve as biological “emergency release valves” to protect cells from lysis upon an acute decrease in osmotic environment, commonly referred to as osmotic downshock; it accomplishes this by rapidly releasing cytoplasmic osmolytes (Booth and Blount, 2012;Levina et al., 1999). The MscL channel is less sensitive than MscS to membrane tension, but it generates a larger pore size, upwards of 30Å (Cruickshank et al., 1997), suggesting it is the last-ditch effort for survival. The MscL family is highly conserved and has a simple structural organization (Balleza and Gomez-Lagunas, 2009;Pivetti et al., 2003). This exaggerated response and simple construction lends itself as a paradigm for how MS channels, in general, can sense and respond to membrane stretch. X-ray crystallography has resolved a MscL homologue fromMycobacterium tuberculosis(Tb-MscL) to be a homopentamer with each subunit containing an amphipathic N-terminal cytoplasmic α-helix running along the cytoplasmic membrane, followed by the two transmembrane α-helices (TM1 and TM2) that are connected by a periplasmic loop, and ending with the five C-terminal α-helixes forming a cytoplasmic helical bundle (Chang et al., 1998;Steinbacher et al., 2007) (also seeFig. 1A). A more recent structure has also been resolved for theStaphylococcus aureus(S. aureus) MscL orthologue (Sa-MscL), which shows a tetrameric rather than pentameric complex (Liu et al., 2009); however, this appears to be a detergent-induced oligomeric rearrangement since the channel forms almost exclusively pentamersin vivo(Dorwart et al., 2010;Iscla et al., 2011). Although the Sa-MscL structure is unlikely to be physiologically relevant, it is worth noting that many of the interactions between the transmembrane domains are similar to those observed in the Tb-MscL crystal structure, suggesting an overall structural conservation within this highly conserved family. A: Crystal structure of Tb-MscL. a homopentamer with each subunit having two transmembrane domains (TM1 and TM2) connected by periplasmic loop (peri-loop) marked in blue, an N-terminal cytoplasmic helix (S1) connected to TM1, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic helical bundle connected to TM2 by a short cytoplasmic loop. The amino acid shown in red is G47 in Tb- MscL, which is equivalent to F47 inS. aureusand I49 inE. coliMscL. B. Sequence alignment of MscL homologs fromE. coli(Eco-MscL) andS. aureus(Sa-MscL). Included in blue boxes are identical and similar residues in theE. coliandS. aureusMscL protein. The arrows and bold labels show the identified analogous amino acid in Eco- and Sa-MscL. The schematic illustration of MscL is also shown above the sequence alignment with S1, TM1, TM2 and c-terminal helix domains shown as boxes and periplasmic and cytoplasmic loops shown as lines. Although highly homologous, MscL channels from different species can vary in threshold of activation, conductance and open dwell time (Folgering et al., 2005;Maurer et al., 2000;Moe et al., 1998). For example, Sa-MscL has a sequence identity of 47% and similarity of 69% withE. coliMscL (Eco-MscL) (Fig. 1B); however, the major physiological differences between the activities of these channels is that the Sa-MscL has much shorter open dwell times (Moe et al., 1998) and requires greater membrane tension to open. To identify the structural features underlying these functional differences, we have generated chimeras in which we have exchanged protein domains, subdomains, and ultimately even individual amino acids, and determined the kinetics and threshold of activation of the resulting channels. Surprisingly, the data indicate that the periplasmic region of the protein, particularly one residue located at the TM1/periplasmic loop lipid interface, plays a major role in both the open dwell time and threshold of activation, or, for simplicity, what we will from here on refer to as mechanosensitivity of the channel. The finding that a site at the membrane interface plays such a crucial physiological role affirms the intimate interactions that membrane-tension-gated channels have with their lipid environment. The periplasmic region of the channel plays a major role in defining channel kinetics The nomenclature of all chimeras tested is as following: E and S represent regions from Eco- and Sa-MscL protein, respectively, which is followed by numbers showing the locations according to the Eco-MscL registry. Schematic illustration of each chimera is shown in the left with open boxes and black lines representing domains fromE. coliMscL, while filled blue boxes and blue lines showing those fromS. aureusMscL. Typical traces, with the appropriate scale bars, are shown at the right of each chimera. Specific areas of the protein that correlate with kinetics are boxed with red boxes highlighting the regions that correlate with long open dwell times and green boxes labeling the regions relevant to short channel kinetics. The chimeras have been grouped as discussed in text. Panel e shows a schematic summary showing the regions identified to be important in channel kinetics. A single residue at the TM1/periplasmic loop lipid interface has a pronounced effect on channel kinetics A. The Isoleucine at position 49 correlates with the long openings observed for the SES44-49 chimera. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed in chimera SES44-49 to re-introduceS. aureusMscL residues, shown as gray dots;E. coliresidues are marked as black dots. The traces were normalized to the scale bar in the upper right. “O” and “C” refer to open and closed. B. Exchanging I49 and F47 betweenE. coliandS. aureusMscL channels changes the channel open dwell time. Mutation of I49 to phenylalanine, aS. aureusMscL equivalent residue, inE. coliMscL generates a channel with short open dwell times. Substitution of F47 with isoleucine, anE. coliequivalent residue, inS. aureusMscL leads to a channel with long open dwell times. At top right of the traces, the scale bars are shown. Additional mutational analysis of the single residue at the TM1/periplasmic loop lipid interface shows a correlation of the properties of residue substitutions with channel kinetics and mechanosensitivity To test whether the equivalent site, I49, in Eco-MscL also plays an important role in channel function, we selectively mutated I49 to F, Y, and C. Surprisingly, we found that same mutations changed channel kinetics and mechanosensitivity with a similar trend as that observed for Sa-MscL (Fig. 5A and BandFig. S3). These data suggest that this site has a conserved function among orthologues. A. The open dwell time τ3 of Sa-MscL and Eco-MscL are plotted for each of the substitutions. Each point reflects a mean value ± s.e.m. The two Y axes are as labeled. B. Correlation between the hydrophobicity and mechanosensitivity. The pL/pS ratio of both Eco-49 and Sa-47 substitutions are plotted against their Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobic scores. While several studies on Eco- or Tb-MscL have suggested that the periplasmic region may play a role in MscL channel regulation (Ajouz et al., 2000;Blount et al., 1996b;Jeon and Voth, 2008;Maurer et al., 2000;Maurer and Dougherty, 2003;Park et al., 2004;Tsai et al., 2005), no one had successfully identified a single sub-domain or residue that acted as a variable spring element, in either a consistent or opposing manner, across bacterial species. In this study, using a chimera approach we were able to identify such subdomains, and ultimately, a single residue. We initially found that the periplasmic loop of Eco-MscL confers short channel openings and that of Sa-MscL defines long openings. In contrast, the relatively conserved TM1/periplasmic lipid interface (44–49) influenced channel kinetics in an opposite manner with that from Eco-MscL effecting long open dwell times, and that from Sa-MscL generating short open dwell times. Thus, these two periplasmic regions appear to work in concert within these two orthologues, and the engineered combination of the Eco-MscL TM1/periplasmic lipid interface and the Sa-MscL periplasmic loop leads to MscL channels with a stabilized open state and extremely long open dwell times. The further dissection of the TM1/periplasmic loop interface led to the finding that a single residue at the lipid interface, I49 for Eco-MscL and the analogous site F47 for Sa-MscL, has profound effects on channel kinetics, thus suggesting an important role of protein-lipid interactions at this region. Furthermore, we generated one particular mutant by site directed mutagenesis, Sa-MscL F47L, which has an extreme channel phenotype in that it shows a severe hysteresis as well as delay in both opening and closing. These data demonstrate that not only can the energy barrier for gating, or the transition between closed and open states, be modified by a mutation at Sa-F47, but that the transition from closed to open can be drastically different from that for going from open to closed states. A recent molecular dynamic simulation study on Eco-MscL channel gating suggests that, during the gating process, membrane thinning induces a kink within the TM1/periplasmic loop interface, essentially in and around Eco-I49, which causes outward motion of the periplasmic loop away from the pore center (Deplazes et al., 2012). We propose that the easing or resisting of some restraint, such as this proposed kink formation, may modulate the transition between open and closed states, like adjusting the spring on a clasp knife. Studying additional channels altered by site-directed mutagenesis, we found consistent correlations between residue properties and their effects on channel function for Sa- as well as Eco-MscL; these data suggest a common functional role for this site between orthologues. As a general rule, hydrophobic residues led to longer open times, although streamlined hydrophobic residues appear to be more efficient in this aspect than those containing bulkier aromatic rings, presumably because of some sort of steric hindrance of the latter. The role of this residue in channel mechanosensation was also studied, and more hydrophobic substitutions were found to decrease mechanosensitivity. Therefore, increasing the hydrophobicity appears to increase the energy barrier required to achieve an open state, but once achieved, the open state is stabilized; increasing the hydrophilicity does the opposite, demonstrating that this spring element is adjusted by hydrophobicity. These findings are reminiscent of early studies suggesting that hydrophobic interactions, coined a “hydrophobic lock”, at the pore constriction keeps the channel closed; according to this theory, it is the exposure of these residues to the aqueous solution that is a major energy barrier for channel opening (Blount et al., 2007;Blount and Moe, 1999;Moe et al., 2000;Yoshimura et al., 1999). Note, however, that the “lock” is due to the bundling of hydrophobic residues from each of the subunits at the constriction of the pore, whereas here we found a residue at the lipid interface where no such bundling of residues is likely to occur. Although we found that the hydrophobicity of this spring element at the TM1 periplasmic lipid interface is important in both channel kinetics and mechanosensation, it is important to note that there are differences in the two correlations. For example, aromatic amino acids fit the hydropathy correlation for mechanosensation but not open dwell time. Several studies emphasize the importance of aromatics in potential lipid interactions for MscL (Sawada et al., 2012) as well as other mechanosensitive channels such as TRPY1 and other TRP channels (Su et al., 2007;Zhou et al., 2007) and belts of aromatics are seen in other membrane proteins, including KcsA (Doyle et al., 1998). Thus, aromatic residue-lipid interactions may play more of a role in mechanosensation than kinetics. We also observed that there is no correlation between mechanosensitivity and open dwell time for the various substitutions. Hence, although the relative hydrophobicity of this spring element effects changes in both kinetics and mechanosensation, it does so by different underlying mechanisms. In summary, by initially using a chimera approach, we identified a single amino acid serves as a “clasp knife spring” for the resistance and stability of channel opening and closing. The hydrophobicity and steric shape of this residue, complemented by the periplasmic loop, appears to define channel mechanosensitivity and kinetics in both Sa- and Eco-MscL. All chimeras were generated using the PCR ligation method (Blount and Krause, 1993;Innis et al., 1990). All other site-directed mutants were generated using Mega primer method as described previously (Levin and Blount, 2004) and all were inserted in the pB10d expression construct (Blount et al., 1996a;Ou et al., 1998). TheE. colistrain PB104 (ΔmscL:Cm) was used for electrophysiological experiments (Blount et al., 1996a;Ou et al., 1998). Cultures were grown routinely in Lennox broth (LB) medium (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburbh, PA, USA) containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Expression was induced by addition of 1 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG; Anatrace inc., Maumee, OH, USA). As described previously (Blount et al., 1999;Martinac et al., 1987), excised, inside-out patches fromE. coligiant spheroplasts were examined at room temperature. Patch buffer contained 200 mM KCl, 90 mM MgCl2, 10 mM CaCl2, and 5 mM HEPES (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), pH 6.0. Data were acquired at −20 mV at a sampling rate of 20 kHz with a 5-kHz filter, using an AxoPatch 200B amplifier in conjunction with Axoscope software (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA, USA). For simplicity, the channel openings are shown upwards in the figures. A piezoelectric pressure transducer (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL, USA) was used to monitor the pressure introduced to patch membrane by suction throughout the experiments. Measurements were performed using Clampfit9 from pCLAMP9 (Axon Instruments). For the kinetic experiments, the data were fit to a three open state model, as previously performed (Blount et al., 1996a;Blount et al., 1996b;Ou et al., 1998). The two longer time constants (τ2 and τ3) could be easily determined; the shortest is beyond the resolution of the equipment used. All kinetic data were obtained from at least 300 opening events per mutant from three independent experiments performed in at least two independent spheroplast preparations. Mechanosensitivity was determined as previously described (Blount et al., 1999;Blount et al., 1996a;Ou et al., 1998). Briefly, MscS is used as an internal standard within the patch, and the ratio of gating pressure for MscL divided by the threshold pressure of MscS is determined; here we will refer to this as the pL/pS ratio. All mechanosensitivity data were obtained from at least three independent recordings performed in at least two independent spheroplast preparations.

DZ made the vast majority of the chimera constructs. LY produced, analyzed, and interpreted the majority of the patch clamp traces; LY also served as a mentor and teacher for DZ mastering electrophysiology, and both ultimately contributed to this aspect of the project.
