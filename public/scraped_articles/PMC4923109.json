Planning is currently underway for future long-duration missions through interplanetary space to the Moon, near-Earth asteroids, or Mars (NASA, 2015). Both the National Research Council (NRC) and the International Space Exploration Coordination Group (ISECG) have assigned a high priority to studies aimed at better understanding astronaut health risks during space exploration; furthermore, these agencies have recognized the International Space Station (ISS) as the best available platform to conduct research activities to address these challenges (International Space Exploration Coordination Group (ISECG), 2013;National Research Council [NRC], 2014). Studies conducted during short- and medium-duration missions (from a few days up to ~1 year) in vehicles such as Spacelab, Soyuz, Shuttle, Mir, and ISS have provided a wealth of information concerning astronaut health and function in the spaceflight environment of low-Earth orbit (LEO;Taylor, 2015). Based on the knowledge gained from these missions, NASA has developed successful risk mitigation strategies. However, long-duration missions (greater than 1 year) into interplanetary space are more likely to expose astronauts to new and higher risks to their health and performance than excursions to LEO, primarily due to: (i) chronic exposure to microgravity; (ii) increased exposure to ionizing radiation from solar and galactic sources; and (iii) extreme confinement and isolation (Reitz, 2008;NRC, 2011;Zeitlin et al., 2013;Taylor, 2015). One particular concern for planners of long-duration missions is the possibility of infectious disease (Scott-Conner et al., 2015;Taylor, 2015). Prolonged exposure to the stresses of spaceflight can lead to dysregulation of astronauts’ immune systems, thus increasing their susceptibility to infectious disease (Crucian et al., 2009;Guéguinou et al., 2009;Taylor, 2015). To minimize the possibility of bringing infectious disease agents onboard, pre-launch mitigation protocols are in place such as screening astronauts for certain microbes and irradiation of food (NASA, 2010). However, the essential nature of the human microbiome (Cho and Blaser, 2012) renders it impossible to remove all potentially infectious microorganisms from astronauts. Indeed, deterioration of astronauts’ immune systems in space has led to increased reactivation of latent viral infections by Varicella–Zoster, Epstein–Barr, and Cytomegalovirus during 12–16 day Shuttle flights (Mehta et al., 2014). Opportunistic bacterial infections of the urinary tract, upper respiratory tract, and subcutaneous tissue have been documented from Shuttle missions STS-1 to STS-108 (Sams, 2009), and conjunctivitis, respiratory tract, and dental infections were documented among long-term inhabitants of space station Mir (Ball and Evans, 2001). Numerous studies have been conducted to understand how bacteria themselves respond to the human spaceflight environment, with particular regard to the possibility of their enhanced pathogenic potential or resistance to antimicrobial treatments [reviewed extensively inRosenzweig et al. (2014)]. In some spaceflight experiments, it has been observed that spaceflight can lead to enhanced virulence in some bacteria (Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, andPseudomonas aeruginosa), but not in others (S. typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureusMRSA,Enterococcus faecalis, andListeria monocytogenes; note: inS. typhimurium, both cases have been observed in different spaceflight experiments; reviewed inRosenzweig et al., 2014). Taken together, the data suggest that the combined phenomena of altered astronaut immunity and heightened virulence of some microbes in the spaceflight environment might lead to an increased incidence of astronaut infections by some opportunistic pathogens during extended missions (Klaus and Howard, 2006). Space stations start out as basically clean environments, but upon habitation, they are rapidly colonized by numerous environmental and astronaut-associated species of microorganisms, which proceed to adapt and evolve in response to selective pressures unique to the spaceflight environment (Novikova, 2004;van Tongeren et al., 2007). A number of opportunistic pathogens have been isolated from space station crew quarters and from astronauts, including both Gram-positive genera (Bacillus, Enterococcus, Staphylococcus, andStreptococcus) and Gram-negative genera (Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Escherichia, Flavobacterium, Haemophilus, Klebsiella, Morganella, Proteus, Pseudomonas, Ralstonia, Serratia, Stenotrophomonas, andYersinia;Ilyin, 2005;Klaus and Howard, 2006). From studies of astronauts on space stations Mir and ISS, it was documented that the microbial diversity of the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts was lowered during spaceflight, while the proportion of opportunistic pathogens increased. In addition, extensive exchange of microbial flora of the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts has been documented among astronauts sharing confined space habitats [reviewed inTaylor and Sommer (2005)]. Recent microbial monitoring of the ISS environment revealed thatBacillusandStaphylococcusspp., are the most ubiquitous organisms cultured from the ISS, being especially abundant in samples taken from crew quarters, vacuum debris, and HEPA filters (Venkateswaran et al., 2014;Checinska et al., 2015). Not surprisingly,Staphylococcus epidermidiswas the most frequently encountered organism in the ISS microbiome, due to its close association with humans as a skin commensal (Venkateswaran et al., 2014). As on Earth, antibiotics are the predominant treatment of choice for bacterial infections on human spaceflight missions. Knowledge about the efficacy of antimicrobial interventions to treat infections during spaceflight is limited, given the difficulty to assess the interplay between pharmacokinetics of antibiotics or the physiologies of host and microbiome, both of which are altered in the spaceflight environment (Wotring, 2012;Taylor, 2015). Decreased susceptibility of microbes to antibiotics has been observed in the space environment during experiments performed onSalyut 7(Tixador et al., 1985) and the Space ShuttlesChallenger(Lapchine et al., 1986) andDiscovery(Tixador et al., 1994). Mutation is a common mechanism by which bacteria become resistant to antibiotics. A body of evidence indicates that the spectrum of spontaneous mutation to antibiotic resistance can be altered by the environment to which microbes are exposed (Nicholson and Maughan, 2002;Nicholson and Park, 2015), including the spaceflight environment (Yatagai et al., 2000). In the experiments described here, we chose to study mutations leading to resistance to the antibiotic rifampcin (Rif), because: (i) Rif is a clinically relevant antibiotic used singly and in combination to treat a wide variety of infections; and (ii) RifRmutations are easily identified by nucleotide sequencing, as they reside within small regions of therpoBgene encoding the β-subunit of RNA polymerase (Severinov et al., 1993). Taken together, the above observations indicate that the possibility must be considered of antibiotic-resistant strains emerging, and potentially becoming dominant types, in the microbiomes of crew members. Therefore, to explore the development of antibiotic resistance in a potential opportunistic pathogen during long-term human habitation in space, the present communication describes experiments using the biological research in canisters (BRIC) hardware in which growth ofS. epidermidis, as well as the frequency and spectrum of mutation to RifR, were measured after spaceflight on the ISS and compared to asynchronous ground controls (GCs). Bacterial Strain, Media, and Growth Conditions The strain used wasS. epidermidisstrain ATCC12228 obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA. Medium used throughout was trypticase soy yeast extract (TSY) medium consisting of (g/L): tryptone, 15; soytone, 5; NaCl, 5; yeast extract, 3; K2HPO4, 2.5; glucose, 2.5; and final pH 7. For semisolid plates, agar was added to TSY at 15.0 g/L. As appropriate, the antibiotic rifampicin (Rif; Sigma–Aldrich) was added to TSY at a final concentration of 5 μg/mL. Staphylococcus epidermidiscells were prepared by overnight growth in TSY liquid medium and a calibration curve was constructed relating Optical Density at 660 nm (OD660) to viable cell titer. Overnight cultures were diluted in TSY to a working concentration of 108CFU per mL prior to use. Aliquots of 0.1 mL (~107CFU) of the suspension were applied to the bottoms of sterile 60-mm diameter Petri dishes (Falcon cat. no. 1007) and air-dried for 48–72 h at room temperature prior to use. The experiments described here utilized BRIC spaceflight hardware, which has been described in detail previously (Paul et al., 2012). BRIC canisters hold six 60-mm diameter Petri dish bottom halves in small subcompartments called Petri dish fixation units (PDFUs). Each PDFU allows for injection of medium, referred to as actuation, to initiate bacterial growth. For flight (FL) experiments, one BRIC canister was used containing six PDFUs. Immediately, adjacent to the FL canister was deployed a HOBO®temperature data logger (Onset Computer Co., Bourne, MA, USA). Post-flight asynchronous GC experiments were conducted using the same hardware and configuration as in the FL experiment. Each PDFU was loaded with a Petri dish containing air-dried cells, and 13 mL of sterile TSY medium was loaded into a separate reservoir. To prevent contamination, all reagents and equipment used were sterilized prior to use and PDFUs were assembled using aseptic technique within a biological containment hood. The BRIC–PDFU payload described above was the 18th BRIC mission to space, and was designated BRIC-18. The BRIC-18 hardware payload was launched on the third SpaceX cargo resupply mission to the ISS (SpaceX-3) on April 18, 2014, using the Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon capsule configuration. The Dragon capsule docked with the ISS on April 21, 2014. The BRIC canister was transferred to the ISS on April 22, 2014 and stowed in the US laboratory module. Actuation of the PDFUs was performed on April 30, 2014 at 10:08 EDT (Figure1A) and samples were incubated at ISS ambient temperature (Figure1B) until May 5, 2014 at 12:04 PM EDT, resulting in a total incubation time of 122 h. Growth was terminated by transfer of the BRIC canister to the onboard −80°C MELFI freezer. Samples were returned to Earth in the Dragon capsule on May 18, 2014 and were maintained in the frozen state until return to Kennedy Space Center (KSC) for de-integration and further processing.

Actuation time is denoted by the upward arrow and termination of experiment by moving to −80°C freezer is denoted by the downward arrow. Asynchronous GC experiments were performed in a BRIC canister according to the timeline determined during the FL experiment. Samples were incubated in the KSC ISS Environmental Simulation Chamber following the temperature regime recorded during flight (Figure1B), and growth was terminated by transfer to a −80°C freezer, where samples were stored until further processing. Post-Experiment Sample Processing Both FL and GC BRIC canisters were transferred from storage at −80°C to a +4°C refrigerator and allowed to thaw overnight. Petri dishes were removed from PDFUs and cells were resuspended using sterile disposable rubber spatulas. Resuspended cultures were transferred to sterile 50-mL conical centrifuge tubes, and the total volume recovered was measured. For viable counts, aliquots from cultures were diluted serially 10-fold in TSY medium, dilutions plated on TSY, and colonies counted after incubation at 37°C for 24 h to obtain CFU/mL. To obtain the total CFU per PDFU, the CFU/mL were multiplied by the volume of liquid recovered. To select for RifRmutants, cultures were concentrated by centrifugation, plated without dilution onto TSY + Rif plates, and colonies counted after incubation at 37°C for 24 h. The frequency of mutation to RifRwas calculated by dividing the total number of RifRmutants by the total number of viable cells from each culture. Individual RifRmutants were streak-purified on TSY + Rif plates and processed for DNA sequencing. Primers used for PCR amplification of two RifRregions of theS. epidermidis rpoBgene are listed inTable1.The correspondingrpoBregions were amplified by PCR directly from cells as previously described (Nicholson and Maughan, 2002) and their nucleotide sequences determined at the University of Florida Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research (UF-ICBR). MultiplerpoBsequences were aligned using the online Clustal Omega server1to identify the position of mutations relative to the wild-typerpoBsequence obtained in parallel fromS. epidermidisATCC12228. Oligonucleotide primers used for amplification ofrpoBregions inStaphylococcus epidermidis. Non-parametric statistical parameters and tests of significance (Kruskal–Wallis) were computed on log10-transformed data using Kaleidagraph version 4.5.2 (Synergy Software, Reading, PA, USA). Temperature Data in FL vs. GC Experiments Temperature data were logged at 10-min intervals during the FL and GC experiments and the data are presented inFigure1B.The average temperature recorded during the growth period in FL was 25.1 ± 0.12°C until 107 h, at which time the immediately adjacent FL HOBO unit malfunctioned for the duration of the experiment (Figure1B). However, the HOBO malfunction did not affect the course of the FL experiment, as other HOBO units in nearby BRIC canisters functioned correctly and confirmed a nominal temperature profile (data not shown). The average temperature in the GC experiment was 24.8 ± 0.16°C, differing from the FL experiment by only 0.3°C. The HOBO unit in the GC experiment performed nominally for the entire 122 h duration of the experiment (Figure1B). Staphylococcus epidermidisGrowth and Frequency of Mutation to RifRin FL vs. GC Viable counts of the cultures in all six PDFUs were determined for both FL and GC samples (Figure2A). AllS. epidermidiscultures grew to high titers in both FL and GC experiments, and viable counts were significantly higher in the GC cultures (Figure2A). To determine the frequency of mutation to RifR, cells from the FL and GC cultures were concentrated by centrifugation and plated onto TSY + Rif. FL cultures ofS. epidermidisexhibited a 24-fold higher frequency of mutation to RifRthan did GC cultures, and this difference was found to be highly significant (Figure2B).

Spectrum of RifRrpoBMutations in FL vs. GC Experiments inS. epidermidis Chromosomal DNA was isolated from a total of 67 FL and 57 GC RifRmutants, and the N-cluster and Clusters I, II, and III of theirrpoBgenes were amplified by PCR and sequenced. The data are presented inTables2and3and summarized graphically inFigure3.Examination of the data revealed notable differences in the mutational spectrum withinrpoBbetween the FL and GC samples. Summary ofrpoBmutations leading to RifRinS. epidermidisflight (FL) vs. ground control (GC) samples. Distribution of classes of RifRrpoBmutations appearing at least once in FL and GC samplesa. aEach class of mutation was scored as either present (X) or absent (blank) in the corresponding PDFU. Totals are tabulated in the rightmost two columns. No mutations were detected in the N-cluster of theS. epidermidis rpoBgene in either the FL or GC samples. All of the RifRmutations identified in both FL and GC samples ofS. epidermidiswere found to occur in Cluster I (Table2;Figure3). In agreement with previous reports (Severinov et al., 1993;Campbell et al., 2001;Nicholson and Maughan, 2002;Perkins et al., 2008), the most common amino acid changes in Cluster I leading to RifRwere found at amino acids Q469, H482, and S487. At codon Q469, both FL (3/8) and GC (4/4) samples exhibited C-to-A transversions in the first position leading to a Q469K substitution (Table2;Figure3). However, FL samples also exhibited two changes at the second position of codon Q469; an A-to-T transversion and an A-to-G transition, leading to the amino acid substitutions Q469L and Q469R, respectively (Table2;Figure3). Together, these two mutations accounted for 5/8, or 63% of the total mutations found in FL samples, but were not represented at all in GC samples. At codon H482 were found the majority of RifRmutations in GC samples (40/57 total, or 70%). In comparing the spectrum of RifRmutations between FL and GC samples, it was observed that all of the RifRmutations identified in the GC samples were found to occur at the first position of codon H482, either C-to-G transversions leading to substitution H482Y (33/35, or 94%), or C-to-T transitions leading to H482D (2/35, or 6%). FL samples also exhibited these same mutations (4/6, or 67% for H482Y; 1/6 or 17% for H482D, respectively;Table2;Figure3). In addition, a single mutation was identified at the second position of codon H482 only in FL samples; this was an A-to-G transition resulting in an H482R substitution (Table2;Figure3). At codon R485, G-to-A transitions were detected at the second position in both FL and GC samples, leading to an R485H amino acid substitution at a slightly higher frequency in GC samples (7/57 total, or 12%) than in FL samples (3/67 total, or 4.5%;Table2;Figure3). At codon, S487 was found the majority of RifRmutations in FL samples (47/67 total, or 70%). The largest proportion of RifRmutations in both FL samples (42/47, or 89%) and GC samples (8/10, or 80%) were found to consist of C-to-T transitions at the second position, resulting in the S487F substitution (Table2andFigure3). The remaining mutations at S487 consisted of C-to-T transitions at the second position, resulting in the amino acid substitution S487Y, found in 5/47 (11%) of FL samples and 2/10 (20%) of GC samples, respectively. Double Mutations in FL Samples Sequence analysis of RifRmutations inS. epidermidis rpoBrevealed two double mutations in FL samples that were not detected in GC samples (Table2andFigure3). The first resulted in the double amino acid change D472Y + S487C and the second resulted in the double amino acid change E461Q + Q469K. While the single amino acid changes D472Y and Q469K have both been associated with RifRin other species, namelyE. coli(Severinov et al., 1993) andBacillus subtilis(Nicholson and Maughan, 2002), at present it is unclear if single mutations inrpoBleading to the E461Q or S487C substitutions by themselves can confer RifRinS. epidermidis. Distribution of RifRrpoBMutations by PDFU Transition vs. Transversion Mutations in FL and GC Samples As reported above, differences were observed in the location ofrpoBmutations in FL vs. GC samples inS. epidermidisRifRmutants. These observations prompted us to examine the nature of nucleotide changes (i.e., transition vs. transversion mutations) in cells cultivated in spaceflight and on the ground. Examination of the distribution of transitions and transversions inS. epidermidissamples revealed the G:A and C:T transitions, and C:A and C:G transversions, were found both in FL and GC samples (Table3). However, FL samples also exhibited A:G transitions and A:T, G:T, and G:C transversions that were not found in GC samples. Thus, the spectrum of mutational classes (transitions vs. transversions) was also altered in FL vs. GC samples. Cell Numbers Achieved during Spaceflight Experiments have been conducted in which the growth of various bacterial species, cultivated under otherwise-matching conditions of hardware, media, inoculation, etc., has been compared in spaceflight vs. GCs. A number of these studies have shown increased final cell density during spaceflight, while others have not observed significant differences between spaceflight and 1 xgconditions (reviewed inBenoit and Klaus, 2007;Horneck et al., 2010;Kim et al., 2013;Rosenzweig et al., 2014). Attempts have been made to explain the phenomenon of bacterial growth to different densities in spaceflight vs. GCs.Benoit and Klaus (2007)suggested that microgravity abolishes convective mixing in liquid culture and that for some unknown reason non-motile cells grow better under these non-mixing conditions (Benoit and Klaus, 2007). According to their model, the movement of motile cells was proposed to mix the liquid medium, thus negating the lack of convective mixing in microgravity and leading to equal growth of motile cells in microgravity and 1 xg(Benoit and Klaus, 2007). However,Kim et al. (2013)recently explored the role of phosphate and/or oxygen availability, carbon source, and motility on the growth ofPseudomonas aeruginosacells in spaceflight vs. GCs. They found that the carbon source used (citrate vs. glucose) did not result in significantly different growth in space vs. ground, but that cultivation under phosphate or oxygen limitation led to increased growth in spaceflight; furthermore, increasing phosphate concentration or aeration resulted in equal growth of cells in space vs. GCs (Kim et al., 2013). In addition, the effect of motility was tested by comparing the growth of the wild-typeP. aeruginosastrain with a non-motile mutant harboring a deletion in themotABCDgenes encoding the flagellar motor proteins. No significant difference in growth of the strains in space vs. ground was found, failing to support the “motility” hypothesis (Kim et al., 2013). The authors concluded that growth ofP. aeruginosato higher density in spaceflight was largely determined by oxygen and/or phosphate limitation, i.e., culture conditions (Kim et al., 2013). Frequency and Spectra of Mutations to RifRin FL vs. GC Samples Few experiments have been performed to measure both the frequency and spectra of mutations in the same gene of microbes exposed to spaceflight in comparison to GCs, and none usingS. epidermidis. In an earlier spaceflight experiment on space station Mir, it was noted that the frequency of mutation to streptomycin resistance (StrR) byB. subtilisspores was not significantly different between FL vs. GC samples, but that the spectrum of StrRmutations in therpsLgene was found to differ substantially (Yatagai et al., 2000). In the experiments reported here, we observed thatS. epidermidiscells behaved somewhat differently, in that they both mutated to RifRwith a significantly (24-fold) higher frequency in FL samples than in GC samples, and also displayed differences in their spectra ofrpoBmutations. Although direct comparison between these two experiments (each using different organisms, growth conditions, and target genes) would be risky, the common finding of altered mutational spectra in both cases is intriguing and warrants further testing. Comparison of Simulated Microgravity vs. Spaceflight Opportunities for true spaceflight experiments are very limited, and it is impossible on the Earth’s surface to generate a true microgravity environment. In response, investigators have turned to a number of ground-based systems that have been designed to simulate the effects of microgravity (reviewed inAnken, 2013). Among these, clinostats utilizing the rotating wall vessel (RWV) system have become widely used as spaceflight culture analogs (Nickerson et al., 2003;Anken, 2013). In some cases, alterations in bacterial gene expression and virulence have been found to correlate well between clinorotation and actual spaceflight experiments, but not in other cases (reviewed inRosenzweig et al., 2014). How does cultivation in spaceflight change the frequency and spectrum ofrpoBmutations conferring RifRtoS. epidermidis? In the experiments reported here, cells were exposed as nearly as possible to matched conditions of hardware, temperature, growth medium, incubation time, and times in stasis both before growth (as air-dried films) and after growth (frozen at –80°C). The two major factors prevailing in spaceflight are decreased gravity and increased ionizing radiation. In orbit, objects inside or attached to the ISS are in free-fall such that the apparent gravitational force they experience is very small (around 1 μg). Microgravity affects a bacterial culture in a number of ways, for example: (i) buoyancy or sedimentation of cells is effectively negated; (ii) the rate of heat and mass transfer via passive convection becomes negligible, and in fact transfer of heat, nutrients, and waste toxins in a static culture becomes dominated by the rate of diffusion; and (iii) liquid behavior at solid surfaces and air–water interfaces is altered in microgravity, as surface tension, viscosity, capillary action, and wetting are removed from gravitational influence (Rosenzweig et al., 2014). The net result is that the same cells cultivated in matched hardware, medium, etc., in FL vs. GC could in fact be residing in two very different environments. Often, an increase in mutation rate can be a response to environmental stress (Galhardo et al., 2007), suggesting that cells in FL samples might be experiencing stress. One way of testing this hypothesis would be to measure global gene expression by performing whole-transcriptome, -proteome, and -metabolome analyses on FL vs. GC cultures, experiments which are currently in progress. The target gene used in this study,rpoB, encodes the β subunit of the enzyme RNA polymerase, a multisubunit enzyme which makes contacts with every transcribed gene in the bacterial genome. We and others have previously shown that single point mutations inrpoBleading to RifRcan profoundly alter the global pattern of gene expression in bacteria and lead to (i) changes in growth, transformation, sporulation and spore resistance properties (Maughan et al., 2004;Moeller et al., 2012); (ii) activation of otherwise cryptic phenotypes (Perkins and Nicholson, 2008); and (iii) artificial triggering of the stringent response (reviewed inAlifano et al., 2015). It will be important to determine how the novel mutational changes inrpoBreported in this communication affect the physiological properties of the resulting mutants, such as their: growth and survival properties on environmental surfaces and in the host; communicability; pathogenic potential; and resistance to multiple antibiotics.
