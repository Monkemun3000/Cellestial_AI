Transcriptomic analyses allow the identification of adaptation response pathways by detecting changes in gene expression at the global genome level caused by the main factors of the space environment, namely altered gravity and cosmic radiation. This article reviews transcriptomic studies carried out from plants grown in spaceflights and in different ground-based microgravity simulators. Despite differences in plant growth conditions, these studies have shown that cell wall remodeling, oxidative stress, defense response, and photosynthesis are common altered processes in plants grown under spaceflight conditions. European scientists have significantly contributed to the acquisition of this knowledge, e.g., by showing the role of red light in the adaptation response of plants (EMCS experiments) and the mechanisms of cellular response and adaptation mostly affecting cell cycle regulation, using cell cultures in microgravity simulators. Subject areas:Plant biology, Omics, Space sciences, Microgravity sciences Cell wall, photosynthesis, and stress response are key in plant adaptation to space DNA methylation and alternative splicing are among the involved molecular mechanisms Light is an essential factor for plant development, even more in the space environment EMCS and simulation cell culture experiments are the main European contributions Plant biology; Omics; Space sciences; Microgravity sciences Space exploration is one of the most fascinating enterprises for humans. It is becoming increasingly evident that plants are an essential companion of humans in space exploration as a privileged source of high quality nutrients and oxygen as well as waste recycling systems, that is, as a key component of bioregenerative life support systems (Fu et al., 2016). Thus, the search for the most efficient way of cultivating plants in space, including the knowledge of the mechanisms of adaptation of plants to the space environment and the careful selection of plant species, varieties and genetic lines, are current major challenges of plant space research (Medina et al., 2021). The most difficult parameter to overcome in the space environment is altered gravity level, because all other parameters such as oxygen and nutrient levels, humidity, temperature, or light conditions can be adjusted. Only cosmic radiation represents a challenge comparable to gravity because of the lack of 100% effective protective shields. On the other hand, plants, like every organism on Earth, have evolved under a constant gravity level and its modification or absence may be a difficult challenge to overcome for an organism. There are different ways to study the effect of microgravity on an organism (Böhmer and Schleiff, 2019). Real microgravity research onboard the International Space Station (ISS) provides the most valuable information (Vandenbrink and Kiss, 2016), but it involves high cost and the access to it is very limited. Compared to a typical ground experiment, which usually involves practically unlimited sample size and the necessary number of performing personnel, spaceflight research imposes major limitations, including the size of and access to experiment equipment and the availability of trained staff and supplies needed to perform the scientific work. Furthermore, there are significant technical challenges that need to be overcome in the design and development of the experimental hardware necessary to operate in low gravity conditions. Retrieval, processing and storage of biological samples need to be optimized, in some cases by developing complex and costly procedures. Despite all these constraints, six decades of research on the effects of long- and short-term missions to space have resulted in a consistent knowledge of many aspects of the impact of extraterrestrial factors, mainly exposure to microgravity, on biological systems. The story started with the sending to space of the first plant materials which were grown on unmanned vehicles. The Soviet Oasis 1 plant growth system, the first facility devoted to space plant research in history, was flown on the Cosmos 368 flight as early as 1970. Soon after, the facility was used by cosmonauts in the manned Salyut 1 mission in 1971 to grow different plant crop species. Since then, different plant cultivation experiments have been flown on crewed vehicles, including the Soviet/Russian Salyut and Mir, the American Shuttle, the Chinese Shenzou, and the ISS. Continuous subsystem improvements and increasing knowledge of plant responses to the spaceflight environment has led to the design of Veggie and the Advanced Plant Habitat, latest in the series of plant growth systems installed in the ISS (Ray et al., 2019;Zabel et al., 2016). All these steps were directed to achieve the main objective of spaceflight biology, which was to gain an understanding of adaptive processes triggered by terrestrial organisms when they are confronted with the novel space environment. The knowledge of the environmental limits of terrestrial biology in spaceflight is key to the design of successful space exploration strategies (Des Marais et al., 2008). During spaceflight, exposure to a novel environment, previously unknown for terrestrial organisms, causes them to modify their growth and development patterns to a greater or lesser extent. These patterns are characterized by certain gene expression profiles capable of guiding growth and ensuring survival. During spaceflight, some sets of genes that were repressed in other environmental conditions are expressed and some other sets of genes are repressed in an attempt to cope with the new environment and adapt, or acclimate, to it (Paul et al., 2012). This response is not unique to plants, but it is enhanced in these organisms by the great reserve of plasticity exhibited by plant genomes, that enables them to respond to unforeseen environmental conditions, such as gravity alteration (Medina et al., 2021). In general, this plasticity is necessary because of the sessile character of plants that immobilizes them to the ground and disables them to escape to another place if the environmental conditions became adverse. One of the sources of genome plasticity is gene redundancy, a feature much more extended in plants than in any other taxonomic group. Plants have undergone extensive duplications (up to four times) of large genomic regions, producing a large amount of duplicated genes (Wang et al., 2011). For example, multiple cyclins and CDKs involved in cell proliferation control exhibit redundant mechanisms for producing the same effect in cell cycle checkpoints (Francis, 2011). In addition to gene redundancy, quicker mechanisms like transposable elements or epigenetic processes, such as DNA methylation operate under environmental stress (Lukens and Zhan, 2007). The adaptive response to spaceflight environment ofArabidopsis thalianaseedlings under darkness condition (BRIC experiments) A series of experiments called “Biological Research in Canisters” (BRIC) were performed in the NASA BRIC hardware, which consists of a simple compartment (canister) holding six 60-mm Petri dishes in small subcompartments called PDFUs (Petri Dish Fixation Unit cassettes) (Table S1). The PDFUs allow the sample fixation inside using an actuator gun. The BRIC hardware was flown as nonpowered payload so the seedlings were grown in the dark for the experiment duration, although a further development called BRIC-LED was implemented, providing lighting capabilities. In particular, BRIC-16 consisted of three individual experiments performed by three research groups as part of the STS-131 mission on the Space Shuttle Discovery in 2010. All BRIC-16 flight samples were grown in darkness for 309 h (12 days and 21h) and then fixed in RNAlater in-orbit. The Ground Control were BRICs prepared identical to spaceflight samples housed in Orbital Environmental Simulator (OES) at the Spaceflight Life Sciences Laboratory (SLSL-KSC) with a 24-h delay to enable duplication of the environmental parameters (temperature, humidity, and CO2concentration) collected by telemetry from the space shuttle (Johnson et al., 2017;Kwon et al., 2015;Paul et al., 2012) (Table 1). Adaptive response to spaceflight environment ofArabidopsis thalianaseedlings under darkness Experiments performed in BRIC hardware, indicating the main characteristics of each of them: experimental conditions, genotype, fixation, tissue used to carry out the transcriptomic study, authors and the GeneLab Data Set (GLDS). See alsoTable S1 The BRIC-16-DNA experiment (Impact of Spaceflight onArabidopsis: Deep Sequencing and DNA Arrays as Collaborative Readouts of the Transcriptome of Arabidopsis Seedlings and Undifferentiated Cell in Space) disclosed thatA. thalianaecotype Columbia (Col-0) seedlings grown in space change the expression of 300 genes with respect to ground control samples. Between the differentially genes expressed, genes upregulated are associated with pathogen response, wounding, drought stress and cold stress (generalized stress-response) and genes downregulated are transcription factors involved in cell wall metabolism and cell elongation and genes encoding proteins that function in calcium-mediated signaling (gravitropism). The authors suggest that both the gravity signaling system and the stress signaling related to wounding and pathogens converge in their responses involving the actin-based cytoskeletal network attached to plasma membrane and the cell wall. It is possible that any of these signaling mechanisms are balanced by the force of gravity. Hence, the absence of gravity may confound the signaling system, inducing inappropriate stress responses as a consequence (Paul et al., 2012). The transcriptional analysis of BRIC-16-Regulation experiment (Actin Regulation ofArabidopsisRoot Growth and Orientation During Space Flight) showed that spaceflight conditions triggered the downregulation of genes involved in cell wall biogenesis and oxidative stress in Col-0 seedlings. Most of these genes are expressed in root hairs (class III peroxidase genes) independently of actin pathways because they were also downregulated in the otherArabidopsisline included in this experiment, theact2-3mutant. These gene expression changes led to shorter root hairs in space-grown seedlings. It is unclear whether this effect was due to microgravityper seor it was a consequence of other spaceflight environmental conditions producing stress, such as hypoxia, which produces the same phenotypic effect. Actually, the BRIC hardware system has several limitations: One is that the seedlings grow confined in small sealed containers for extended periods of time, and other is the absence of orbit 1gcontrol which makes it difficult to distinguish true microgravity effects from other secondary spaceflight effects (Kwon et al., 2015). BRIC-16-Cytoskeleton study (Investigations of the Plant Cytoskeleton in Microgravity with Gene Profiling and Cytochemistry) focused on gene expression changes in shoots of Ler-0 plants. The functional analysis showed that many upregulated transcripts in spaceflight conditions were implicated in metabolic process and transport. Most of these genes were localized in the extracellular matrix and involved in cell wall modification. On the other hand, and unlike the other two BRIC-16 experiments, the downregulated genes were often involved in stress response. This result was associated with the fact that the transcriptional analysis only included shoots. At the same time, an abundance of adventitious roots (immediately transport oxygen from the substrate to shoots) was observed in spaceflight seedlings, suggesting that roots may undergo greater hypoxic stress than shoots during spaceflight. Therefore, pooling all plant organs together for a single analysis could provide an incomplete picture. Another experiment that used the BRIC hardware to quantify protein and transcript differential expression of 3-day-old, etiolated Col-0 seedlings grown aboard the ISS, was launched on January 10, 2015 (Space-X CRS-5). The simultaneous proteomic and transcriptomic analyses provided a more complete picture of plant response to spaceflight (Kruse et al., 2020). In addition to the ground control (at ISSES with 48-h delay), in this experiment, two additional analyses were performed to eliminate significant changes in the transcriptome and proteome ofArabidopsisseedlings that could be attributed to the hardware (Basu et al., 2017) or to the RNAlater preservative (Kruse et al., 2017) (Table 1). These studies revealed marked impacts on post- transcriptional regulation, cell wall synthesis, redox/microtubule dynamics and plastid gene transcription in the plants exposed to microgravity. The effects on microtubule dynamics (alpha tubulins) were explained as a relevant physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment, because alpha tubulin has the potential to enhance cytoskeletal organization and cell wall composition, thereby enhancing the structural integrity of cells in microgravity. A wide variety of plastid-localized and plastid-produced genes appeared differentially regulated in the flight samples, but they were not present in the proteomic data. This result was surprising because BRIC hardware prevents all light from reaching the plants, and it was interpreted as a wasteful effort to enhancing light signaling to compensate for the absence of gravity. In summary, the unified transcriptomic and proteomic analysis points out the regulation of specific elements of cell wall, microtubule synthesis and plastid transcripts production as three new targets to achieve optimal plant growth during future long-term spaceflight missions (Kruse et al., 2020). The adaptive response to spaceflight environment ofArabidopsis thalianaseedlings under light conditions Adaptive response to spaceflight environment ofArabidopsis thalianaseedlings under light conditions Experiments performed in different hardware that provided illumination, indicating the main characteristics of each of them: Experimental conditions, genotype, fixation, tissue used to carry out the transcriptomic study, authors and the GeneLab dataset (GLDS). See alsoTable S1 Among genes that were upregulated in spaceflight forsku5many were LEA (Late Embryogenesis abundant) family genes, associated with seed dormancy, negative regulation of post-embryonic development and ABA signaling to enhance stress resistance (osmotic, cold, and drought) through membrane stabilization, ROS sequestration and protein aggregation prevention. Moreover, processes involved with salt, ROS stress, and light responses were terms enriched significantly at 4 days and at 8 days and terms associated with cell wall remodeling and biosynthetic processes were overrepresented. Thesku5andspr1different gene expression patterns, considering the number of differentially expressed genes and their fold-change levels as a measure of metabolic cost of adapting to environment, suggest that mutation of the SPR1 skewing pathway enhances spaceflight physiological adaptation and the SKU5 pathway plays a key role in adaptation to this environment. Furthermore, the fact thatspr1andsku5root lengths are not altered by spaceflight, indicate that the effects of these mutations lie in processes directing morphology and structure and not in growth processes (Califar et al., 2020). Epigenetic changes in Arabidopsis seedlings in response to spaceflight were studied by conducting a whole genome bisulfate sequencing to discover and qualitatively assess spaceflight-associated 5-methyl cytosine epigenetic modifications. In this experiment, 6- day-old Col-0 plants pre-cultured on ground were transferred to culture chambers aboard the Chinese recoverable scientific satellite SJ-10 (launched on April 6 and landed on April 18, 2016) and after grown up to 60 h (2.5 days) under microgravity conditions, seedlings were fixed with RNAlater using a canal system and pump support system included in the equipment. The second experiment was carried out on the Chinese recoverable satellite SJ-10 (launched on April 6, 2016). The plant growth system used consisted of four growth compartments, illumination, photograph, air-flowing, heating, and humidity controlling system. TheA. thalianalines used were WT (Col-0) and transgenic plants (pHSP:FT,pHSP:GFPor FG) expressing FT together Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) under control of a heat shock-inducible promoter (HSP17.4), by which it is possible to induce FT expression in-flight by heat shock treatment. The plants loaded in the growth chambers were germinated and grown in the root modules on ground under LD or SD conditions for 20 days, so they had about six to seven rosette leaves when the satellite was launched. After 12 days and 15 h in orbit, SJ-10 returned to Earth and 2 h after landing the plants were harvested and fixed with RNAlater solution (Table 2). As the images taken during the development of the experiment revealed, under the LD condition flowering occurred two days later in the space samples than in the ground controls for both the WT plants and the FG plants. In contrast, under the SD condition after heat shock treatment (37°C for 1h), in WT plants this delay was reduced to 1 day and in FG plants it disappeared, flowering both on ground and in space at 3 days. Microarray analysis was performed using the total RNA from leaves of WT and FG plants grown under LD and the SD in space and on ground, respectively. In the study of the categories of gene expression affected by spaceflight under different photoperiods, 4512 genes in WT and 4201 genes in FG response specifically to the LD or the SD (named \"daylength-related-sp\" or \"dl-sp\"). This higher number of “dl-sp” genes indicates that daylength is an important factor to regulate the response of plants to spaceflight. To further study response of plants to spaceflight after FT expression in the FG plants under the SD in comparison with WT plants, the authors compared the number of DEGs in response to spaceflight under the LD and the SD, respectively, among WT and FG samples. In these comparisons, they identified that 534 DEGS represented the group of genes in FG under the SD condition insensitive to spaceflight stress (unchanged in FG under the LD in space) and they were involved in cellular metabolic processes, as amino acid, amine, and oxoacid metabolic process. Gene expression changes in well-controlled environmental conditions including several light profiles and partial gravity levels (EMCS experiments) The European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) was another hardware facility aboard ISS which was used to grow plants on space. It provided directional light with white LEDs, controlled environment conditions (temperature, humidity, CO2, O2and ethylene concentration) and it was equipped with two centrifuges that allowed to incubate the samples at different levels of gravity, up to 2g. This allowed them to perform an on-board 1gcontrol, and also to incubate the samples at the so-called “partial gravity levels”, lower than 1g, such as those characterizing the surfaces of the Moon and Mars. In the TROPI-2 experiment (launched on space shuttle mission STS-130 in February 2010) WT seedlings ofArabidopsis thaliana Landsberg erecta(Ler) ecotype were grown for 6 days within the EMCS, and they were photostimulated with blue or red light at seven gravitational acceleration levels (μg, 0.07g, 0.13g, 0.21g, 0.39g, 0.53gand 1g) for the last 48h of the growth period. For seedling growth, photostimulation and video recording, samples were contained in special cassettes equipped with a hydration mechanism remotely operated, blue, red and white LEDs, which were used instead of the EMCS lighting system, and an “anti-fog” device that prevented water condensation from the cassette window. After the photostimulation phase, a crew member transferred samples from the EMCS to the to the MELFI (Minus-Eighty Degree Laboratory Freezer for ISS) facility for preservation until download. The ground control was performed in a laboratory incubator following the exact timeline and light treatments as the spaceflight experiment (Kiss et al., 2012). TROPI-2 experiment was a duplication of the original TROPI experiment after the problems experienced with the samples because of the presence of toxic volatile substances in the hardware (Table 3). Adaptive response to spaceflight environment ofArabidopsis thalianaseedlings under light condition and partial gravity levels Experiments performed in EMCS hardware, indicating the main characteristics of each of them: experimental conditions, genotype, fixation, tissue used to carry out the transcriptomic study, authors and the GeneLab Data Set (GLDS). See alsoTable S1. The primary objectives of the TROPI-2 experiment were to study plant tropisms in spaceflight (interaction between gravitropic and phototropic signals) using images, but samples from this experiment were also used to perform transcriptome analyses with RNA was extracted from whole seedlings, with the purpose of maximizing the scientific returns of the spaceflight experiment. The comparison between all spaceflight samples, regardless of their gravity or light treatment, with the 1gground samples, identified 280 genes that were differentially regulated. However, in the comparison of allg-treated spaceflight samples with microgravity samples, only 130 genes were identified as being differently regulated. From these genes, several of them were involved in cell polarity, cell defense or stress, and cell wall development. This result suggested that all of the spaceflight samples had a more similar environment because overall fewer number of genes were differentially expressed in the second comparison than in the first one, supporting the role that gravity plays in affecting these key developmental pathways, which were both represented in the two comparisons. In addition, as this hardware allowed performing a 1g-spaceflight control, these samples were compared with the 1gground control. This resulted in a large number of genes differentially regulated (230), many of them implicated in cell-wall development, cell polarity and oxygen responses, among other categories. The fact that the 1gspaceflightversus1gground samples revealed many genes with deregulated expression could be because of spaceflight effects other than microgravity (vibration, radiation exposure, etc), emphasizing the need for tissue fixation on board the ISS and better environmental monitoring tools to improve ground experiments (Correll et al., 2013). The “Plant Signaling” experiment, also carried out in the EMCS (launched in July 2011 aboard STS-135), studied the transcriptional profiling of root samples exposed for 5 days under continuous light at microgravity or partialg(0.53g, 0.65gand 0.88g) (Table 3). The analysis identified 101 genes whose expression levels were associated with gravity dose following three different patterns: increase or decrease expression in response to increasingglevels (dose-dependent linear response), peak or dip at an intermediateglevel (peak up or peak down response) and induced or repressed expression levels to a thresholdglevel (threshold response). In addition, the identification of the biological functions or pathways of these 101 fractional-gresponsive genes showed that they were genes involved in transcription regulation, chaperone function, cell wall and defense response. All of these categories had been previously described as being responsive to the plant response to the space environment (Sheppard et al., 2021). Adaptive response to spaceflight environment of other plant species The molecular response to the long-term spaceflight environment of Mizuna plants was measured using genome-wide mRNA expression analysis (mRNAseq). Seeds ofBrassica rapa var.nipposinica(Mizuna) were germinated and grown in Lada growth chambers aboard to Zvezda module of ISS. These chambers include a root module, leaf chamber and light module. After 27 days cultivation, the plants were harvested and stored at −80°C in the MELFI freezer. Once back on Earth, total RNA from leaves samples was extracted. The fresh weight and water content (spaceflight: 82.9g and 92.5%, ground control: 58.0g and 92.0%) showed that Mizuna plants grew as well or better under spaceflight environment than on the ground. The transcriptomic analysis revealed that in space-grown plants a total of 20 in 32 ROS oxidative markers were upregulated more than two-fold, including the major ROS-scavenging enzymes: thioredoxin and glutaredoxin. In addition, two ROS-producing genes (NADPH oxidase genes: RbohD and RbohF) were upregulated 3-fold and 5.1-fold, respectively. These findings suggest that the Mizuna plants can acclimate to long-term exposure in the spaceflight environment by reprogramming ROS gene network expression, producing ROS to maintain the activation of ROS signal network to control the defense system with ROS-scavenging system (Sugimoto et al., 2014). Arabidopsis thalianacell culture adaptive response to spaceflight environment (Table S2) Arabidopsis thalianacell culture adaptive response to spaceflight environment Experiments performed in different hardware, indicating the main characteristics of each of them: experimental conditions, genotype, fixation, tissue used to carry out the transcriptomic study, authors and the GeneLab Data Set (GLDS). See alsoTable S2. The aforementioned BRIC-16-DNA experiment also included the transcriptome analysis ofArabidopsis thalianatissue culture cells (Paul et al., 2012)(Table 4). One of the most striking molecular differences observed was the significant increase in expression of most heat shock proteins (HSP) and heat shock factor (HSF) transcriptional activators genes in spaceflight non-differentiated tissue culture cells. Among these genes, the HsfA2 transcription factor which is involved in the late phases of heat stress response, and two of its targets: Hsp17.6A, that blocks protein aggregation, and Hsp101, that facilitates dissociation of already formed protein aggregates. In addition, the expression changes in these two HSP proteins, as markers of late stress response, were studied in parabolic flights (hypergravity and hypogravity alternation), in simulated microgravity (2D clinorotation) and in simulated hypergravity (centrifuge) by RT-qPCR. Among gravitational conditions examined, only 2D clinorotation induced the expression of both Hsp101 and HSP17.6A at the same levels as spaceflight. This fact suggests that hypergravity forces experienced at the space shuttle launch do not contribute to the elevated level of HSP transcripts in spaceflight samples. Therefore, a unique feature of microgravity engages HSPs as part of a later-phase adaptive response to spaceflight conditions, probably associated with the role played by them in cytoskeletal organization, preventing cytoskeletal scaffold collapse in a non-gravity environment (Zupanska et al., 2013). The Cellular Expression Logic, or CEL BRIC-17 experiment, was a modification of the previousArabidopsiscell cultures experiment in BRIC-16. In this experiment, launched on SpaceX CRS-2 to the ISS on 1 March 2013, besides the WT cell line, two mutant lines were used: ARG1 KO and HSFA2 KO (Zupanska et al., 2017,2019). The knockout line deficient in the gene encoding ARG1 was selected for the role of this protein in gravisignaling, whereas the knockout line deficient in the gene encoding HSFA2 was selected because this protein is a key regulator of the defense response, via HSP chaperone transcriptional activation, to several types of environmental stresses (Table 4). The transcriptome analysis, after 10 days on orbit, showed that both mutant cell lines used substantially more and different gene expression profiles to achieve a spaceflight-adapted state compared to WT cells. This observation led to conclude that a proficient spaceflight adaptation requires a functional HSF network and functional ARG1 protein. The functional gene categorization revealed that, although individual genes were different in each expression set, those genes were largely representative of the same biological processes, suggesting slightly different routes, which appeared to be utilized to converge on the same basic adaptive strategies. In addition, most of the genes altered in expression in spaceflight in WT cells were found to beArg1-andHsfA2-dependent. Specifically, these genes were involved in cell wall remodeling, intracellular transport and starch biosynthesis, suggesting major and specific roles of these two proteins in the physiological spaceflight adaptation through these processes. Overall, this study showed up that the use of knockout lines greatly increases the list of genes that are necessary to adapt to and survive in the spaceflight environment. This amplifies the information that is necessary to learn on what biological processes are necessary and what genes are involved in these processes (Zupanska et al., 2017,2019). Arabidopsis thalianacell culture adaptive response to simulated space environments (Table S3) Arabidopsis thalianacell culture adaptive response to simulated space environments Experiments performed in different microgravity simulators or facilities, indicating the main characteristics of each of them: experimental conditions, genotype, and fixation, tissue used to carry out the transcriptomic study, authors and the GeneLab Data Set (GLDS). See alsoTable S3. In another work, callus semi-solid cultures ofA. thaliana, prepared from MM2d suspension cultures, were exposed for 200 min to two paradigms of simulated microgravity (a mechanical one, the Random Positioning Machine (RPM) and diamagnetic levitation) and hypergravity (the Large Diameter Centrifuge (LDC)). Five environments with different levels of effective gravity (g) and magnetic field (B) strengths within a magnet (μg∗B = 10.1 T, 0,1g∗ B = 14.7 T, 1g∗ B = 16.5 T, 1.9g∗ B = 14.7 T and 2g∗ B = 10.1 T) and samples exposed to RPM simulated microgravity (μg) and hypergravity (2g) in the Large Diameter Centrifuge (LDC) were compared (Manzano et al., 2012) (Table 5). The effects on the overall transcriptional state of callus exposed to these altered gravitational environments were studied. Microarray analysis indicated that barely a few genes were differentially expressed (not reaching statistical significance) when exposed to these unusual environments compared with internal 1gcontrols (particularly because of the large effect of high-energy magnetic field). However, using a detailed analysis based on clustering of similarly expressed genes (Gene Expression Dynamics Inspector-GEDI) it was found that gravitational and magnetic fields had a synergistic effect on the transcriptional profile because both the number of altered genes and the GO groups affected increased when a magnetic field gradient was applied, mainly affecting structural, abiotic stress and secondary metabolism genes. In fact, it is the first study in which a 0.1g partial gravity samples show larger effects that those observed in the equivalent simulated microgravity sample under the same environmental condition. The GEDI analysis also revealed that, there is a global signature, specifically including abiotic stress genes, that behave in an opposite manner under micro and hypergravity environments (Manzano et al., 2012). Adaptive response to spaceflight environment of cell cultures from other species The spaceship Shenzhou mission also included one experiment to study gene expression in rice calli in response to microgravity. Rice calli (Oryza sativa) were loaded onto the stationary and rotating platforms of Simbox incubator and were fixed in RNAlater in space after 324h (13,5 days) spacecraft flight (Table 4). The functional analysis identified that the microgravity-response transcripts were associated with metabolism and signaling pathways of hormones, transcription factors, starch, glycolysis and the electron chain, protein degradation, transporters and cell wall metabolism. Among cell wall-related genes, genes related to cell wall formation/degradation were downregulated and transcripts corresponded to proteins involved in primary cell wall modification were upregulated. In addition, genes of the aquaporin family (water channels) were upregulated in spaceflight environment. The changed levels of these cell wall loosening and cell wall precursor synthesis-related genes together with aquaporin genes may establish of a new balance between cell wall rigidity and cell turgor pressure under microgravity conditions. Therefore, cell wall relaxation and extension may be regarded as microgravity plants adaptation (Jin et al., 2018). Even considering that novel experimental approaches take more time to be incorporated to space research than to general life science research on ground because of obvious and specific constraints of spaceflight experiments, these technologies have provided more than 25 datasets deposited in GeneLab database (Tables S1,S2yS3). In that regard,Figure 1illustrates the type of studies performed at the international level, arranged according to the materials and facilities used. The European contribution to the global plant biology experimentation is modest in the global numbers (8 of 30 studies) but particular contributions have been made in key topics. An example is the European co-leadership of the largest plant experiment carried out on board the ISS, using the most sophisticated hardware, that is the EMCS, including lighting at different wavelengths, partial-gand 1g, and environmental controls (Herranz et al., 2019;Vandenbrink et al., 2019;Villacampa et al., 2021). Also, there is a key contribution of European teams in simulated microgravity facilities and the use of cell cultures to uncover fundamental mechanisms discriminating the professional response to the lack of gravity from the purely cellular response and adaptive mechanisms. It is particularly relevant to realize that a small number of cell-based studies in simulators may have contributed to our understanding of these mechanisms more significantly than some spaceflight missions. Distribution of Plant Space Omics contributions submitted to the GeneLab database Most European contributions (in bold) have been done using cell culture experiments in simulated microgravity facilities (10% of the experiments) and the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) into the ISS (17% of the experiments). Other facilities frequently used in spaceflight experiments are the Biological Research in Canisters (BRIC) hardware and the VPS-VEGGIE cultivation chamber. At the top and the bottom part of the figure, images of some of the different facilities used are shown. From left to right and from top to bottom: Random Positioning Machine (credit ESA), Magnetic Levitation Instrument (credit Nottingham University) BRIC (credit NASA), Large Diameter Centrifuge (credit ESA), EMCS (credit ESA/NASA) and VEGGIE (credit NASA). Consequently, we are in conditions of identifying some mechanisms of adaptation of plants to microgravity, based on similar gene expression profiles obtained in different experiments (Figure 2). The absence of gravity is perceived by the plant as a stress factor, which will trigger a whole series of adaptation reactions of the plant to this new environmental factor. Some of these reactions seem to be specifically targeted in the maintenance of cell integrity, such as cell wall remodeling, whereas others affect plant metabolism, such as photosynthesis, the electron transfer chain in mitochondria, and the communication between nuclei, plastids, and mitochondria. Finally, other reactions are systematically triggered by many biotic and abiotic stresses, such as oxidative stress, defense reactions and HSPs (chaperone proteins). Although the link between all responses has yet to be determined, it is clear that all of them play an essential role in the adaptation of plants to the space environment, becoming key targets for optimal growth plants to support future long-term spaceflight missions. (Figure 3). The main spaceflight-related genes Transcriptomic analyses of the numerous space experiments have so far identified a set of genes whose expression is altered by the spaceflight environment in a similar way among the different experiments. The genes were grouped according to the function of their proteins. (N) nucleus, (P) plastid, (M) mitochondria, (PR protein) pathogenesis related protein, (ROS) reactive oxygen species, (HSF) heat shock factor, (HSP) heat shock protein. Proposed model of the microgravity adaptation mechanism inArabidopsis thaliana Microgravity is perceived by the plant as an abiotic stress factor which activates the production of ROS. The signal, which is perceived at the plasma membrane, is then transmitted via Ca2+, MAPKs and phytohormones (auxin) to the nucleus where it triggers TFs like HSF. The TFs then regulate the expression of a set of genes that trigger molecular, cellular and physiological responses, leading to the establishment of the plant adaptation to the spaceflight environment. (ROS) reactive oxygen species, (TFs) transcription factors, (HSF) heat shock factor, (HSP) heat shock protein. Finally, we consider it necessary to recapitulate why this research is actually important and worth to be performed. As previously indicated, studying the adaptation of plants to the space environment is an essential step towards successfully integrating plants into life support systems. During spaceflight, plants will have to adapt to a new environment where factors such as micro- and mini-gravity (gravities of spaceflight, the Moon and Mars) and chronic low-level cosmic radiation are completely new to them. In that regard, experiments introducing partial gravity levels, and particularly the levels around the Moon gravity, are becoming mandatory. A potential risk in using low gravity levels (circa0.1g) with more deleterious effects than microgravity itself have been revealed (Herranz et al., 2019;Manzano et al., 2018), and the decommissioning of EMCS in 2018 from the ISS made us less able to provide new experiments at those conditions. The transcriptomic studies included in this review focus on the search carried out mainly in GeneLab Data Repository and despite the fact that the GLDS data set includes an interface to search datasets on key repositories (NIH GEO, EBI PRIDE, and ANLMG-RAST), some work focused on transcriptomic changes produced by a space environment might not have been included.
