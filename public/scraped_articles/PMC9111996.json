While studies have shown an increase in pathogenicity in several microbes during spaceflight and after exposure to simulated microgravity, the mechanisms underlying these changes in phenotype are not understood across different pathogens, particularly in opportunistic pathogens. This study evaluates the mechanism for increased virulence of the opportunistic gram-negative bacterium,Serratia marcescens,in simulated microgravity. Low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) is used in ground-based studies to simulate the effects of microgravity as experienced in spaceflight. Our previous findings showed that there was a significant increase in mortality rates of theDrosophila melanogasterhost when infected with either spaceflight or LSMMG treatedS. marcescens. Here, we report that LSMMG increases asparagine uptake and synthesis inS. marcescensand that the increased host lethality induced by LSMMG bacteria grown in rich media can be recapitulated in minimal media by adding only aspartate and glutamine, the substrates of asparagine biosynthesis. Interestingly, increased bacterial growth rate alone is not sufficient to contribute to maximal host lethality, since the addition of aspartate to minimal media caused an LSMMG-specific increase in bacterial growth rate that is comparable to that induced by the combination of aspartate and glutamine, but this increase in growth does not cause an equivalent rate of host mortality. However, the addition of both aspartate and glutamine cause both an increase in host mortality and an overexpression of asparagine pathway genes in a LSMMG-dependent manner. We also report that L-asparaginase-mediated breakdown of asparagine is an effective countermeasure for the increased host mortality caused by LSMMG-treated bacteria. This investigation underscores the importance of the asparagine utilization pathway by helping uncover molecular mechanisms that underlie increased mortality rates of a model host infected with microgravity-treatedS. marcescensand provides a potential mitigation strategy.

Human pathogens occupy a wide variety of ecological niches, including those in the harsh conditions imposed by spaceflight. Understanding the effects that spaceflight may have on the adaptation and fitness of human pathogens is necessary to predict potential causes of health problems during future missions, where the availability of treatment and prevention options is limited. This is even more important in the context of opportunistic bacterial pathogens, which typically produce benign infections, until they are challenged by certain environmental conditions or when host immune impairments occur, which can then equip them with the ability to cause serious health concerns [1]. One such environmental condition is spaceflight, which has been demonstrated to convert opportunistic pathogens to primary pathogens, enabling them to take advantage of a compromised immune system that may occur to astronauts during spaceflight [2,3]. In line with this, there is mounting evidence that primary bacterial pathogens often undergo a diversity of significant phenotypic shifts during spaceflight, including increased antibiotic resistance [4,5,6,7], increased virulence [8,9,10,11], and morphological changes associated with pathogenicity [12]. Despite mounting research in these primary pathogens, much less is known about phenotypic shifts that occur to opportunistic pathogens when exposed to microgravity. Specifically, there is little known about how pathogens may be utilizing nutrients differently in the microgravity environment of space compared to ground microbes, and potentially how these mechanistic changes might be influencing the host immune response during infection. Due to increased nosocomial reports, the human opportunistic bacteria,Serratia marcescens,has emerged as a model for studying rapid shifts in virulence and antibiotic resistance [13,14].S. marcescensis a ubiquitous pathogen that occupies a wide variety of habitats and hosts. It can adapt quickly to antibiotics independently and simultaneously, which is likely due to the loss of conserved genetic elements and large genomic diversity among strains [14,15,16]. Furthermore,S. marcescenswas found aboard the spacecraft Mir, and in condensed water aboard the International Space Station [17,18]. Therefore, this ubiquitous pathogen should be monitored closely for spaceflight-induced changes that may pose a threat to immunocompromised astronauts that are more susceptible to opportunistic pathogens and especially considering the complications with antibiotic resistance [2,18]. Research in our laboratory has demonstrated that there is a significant shift in virulence withS. marcescens(Db11) after spaceflight. When cultured aboard the International Space Station,S. marcescensDb11 killed healthy ground-rearedDrosophila melanogasterhosts significantly faster than an identical control of the bacteria that was cultured on the ground [11]. However, the specific mechanisms of increased Db11 virulence and reducedD. melanogastersurvival are currently unknown. In line with this, increased virulence is observed with various space and low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG)-isolated bacteria, including studies withSalmonella[19], andStaphylococcus aureus[20], which pose a threat to astronaut health during spaceflight. Our prior research has shown thatSerratia marcescensalso shows a significant increase in host lethality ofD. melanogasterafter growth in simulated microgravity (LSMMG) conditions [11]. Since spaceflight studies are costly and can be difficult to perform due to constraints on experimental design and the availability of spaceflight opportunities, many researchers perform ground-based studies using devices such as the rotating wall vessel (RWV) to simulate microgravity [21,22,23]. The RWV simulates microgravity by rotating at a speed and orientation which keeps cells suspended in liquid without bubbles, thereby creating a low fluid shear environment that simulates the weightlessness that cells experience during spaceflight [24] and is referred to as the LSMMG treatment. When using the RWV to induce LSMMG, the vessel is rotated such that the axis of rotation is perpendicular to the gravity vector and the rotation offsets the sedimental effects of gravity and keeps the cells in continuous suspension (LSMMG). In contrast, in the control orientation (RWV-Control), the axis of rotation is parallel to the gravity vector and does not offset the sedimentation induced by Earth's gravitational force. Thus, in the RWV-Control, the cells can settle at the bottom of the container and experience Earth gravity (1g) without continuous suspension while acting as a control for any potential biological effects of the vessel itself. Although this method is not an exact recreation of the spaceflight environment, the effects of the LSMMG environment have been demonstrated to recapitulate findings from spaceflight studies [10,11]. Drosophila melanogaster, as used in this study, has proven to be a useful host model for spaceflight and ground-based studies in the past. This is due to their well-characterized innate immune system, tractable genetics, ease of use, short life-cycle, genetic homology to mammalian systems, and low resource requirements for breeding large colonies [11,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35]. In the current study, we use LSMMG to investigate the specific mechanisms that enable microgravity-treatedSerratia marcescensbacteria to kill the hostD. melanogastermore quickly than control bacterial cultures. A screen of several genes related to knownS. marcescensvirulence factors did not reveal any differences of expression in LSMMG compared to RWV-Control. Further testing revealed a LSMMG-dependent overexpression of the gene asparagine synthetase B (asnB), which is implicated in virulence and resistance to drugs in other pathogenic bacteria [36,37]. This gene is involved with amino acid metabolism and has been linked to both pathogen growth and virulence [38]. Amino acids like asparagine are thought to be important to the competition between hosts and pathogens in determining the outcome of an infection [38]. Since our previous study indicated that the LSMMG-rearedS. marcescenskilled the host faster after infection [11] than controlS. marcescenscultures, we wanted to explore whether the asparagine pathway might be linked to the increased host mortality caused by LSMMG treatment. 2.1. The asparagine pathway and extracellular asparagine and glutamine concentrations are affected by simulated microgravity treatment ofS. marcescens Our previous findings have indicated thatS. marcescensexposed to LSMMG for 24 h grow at a faster rate inside the host after infection and caused increased host lethality inD.melanogaster[11]. First, we looked at several genes involved in flagella formation, membrane-bound proteins, and known virulence genes, and did not see significant upregulation in LSMMG compared to the control bacteria (Table 3). We, therefore, looked at other genes linked to bacterial growth mechanisms and found that genes related to asparagine metabolism were upregulated in LSMMG. More specifically, we found that there was a significant upregulation inasnB(asparagine synthetase B), which is a gene that regulates the conversion of aspartate to asparagine using ATP and glutamine (Figure 1A,B). Therefore, we evaluated the expression of genes that are important for asparagine and glutamine metabolism. Gene expression analyses showed that the expression level of the geneasnB(asparagine synthetase B) was 39.17 fold higher in LSMMG-treated cells relative to the RWV-control (P < 0.0001), as well as a 10.5 fold increase in expression of L-asparaginase (L-ap, P = 0.054), but there was no significant difference in expression for the other genes tested, although several genes showed a positive trend for expression levels:L-ap1(L-asparaginase 1),L-ap2(L-asparaginase 2),iaaA(isoaspartyl peptidase/L-asparaginase), orastL(asparagine tRNA ligase) (Figure 1D).asnBis a gene that catalyzes the conversion of aspartate to asparagine using ATP and glutamine, and is known to be linked to virulence and antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens [36,37]. The L-asparaginase subunits assist with asparagine catabolism and nitrogen homeostasis [39], therefore, an overexpression of these genes suggests that there is an increase in asparagine catabolism as part of the overall homeostatic regulation of the asparagine pathway. Expression values of candidate genes inS. marcescensfor growth, motility, and virulence as measured by qPCR. Expression values are reported as fold change in LSMMG relative to RWV-Control and calculated using the ΔΔ Ct method. Samples were grown in the RWV for 24 h, then fixed in RNAlater for extraction. Samples were run with three technical replicates per plate, and were performed in three biological replicates. Values reported are the average across all replicates. All averaged replicates reported are p < 0.01. The asparagine pathway and increased uptake of extracellular asparagine and glutamine from nutrient-rich LB media under simulated microgravity. Measurements of amino acid consumption were performed by removing cells from media by centrifugation and utilizing spectrophotometric analysis with Megazyme™ reagent. A) The asparagine biosynthesis pathway. B) At the end of the growth period ofS. marcescensin simulated microgravity (LSMMG orientation), gene expression for each sample was measured via qPCR:L-ap(L-asparaginase),L-ap1(L-asparaginase 1),L-ap2(L-asparaginase 2),asnB(asparagine synthetase B),iaaA(isoaspartyl peptidase/L-asparaginase), orastL(asparagine tRNA ligase). Expression values are reported as fold change relative to the RWV-Control orientation and calculated using the ΔΔ Ct method. Specific genes represented by the blue end of the color spectrum indicated gene overexpression and those towards the red end indicated inhibition of gene expression. Error bars represent one standard error. Measurements of C) extracellular asparagine and D) extracellular glutamine were performed at hours 0, 6, and 14 of growth in the rotating wall vessel, with an initial starting concentration of 1 × 108CFU. Taken together, the almost 40-fold overexpression of theasnBgene in LSMMG coupled with the overexpression of the asparaginase subunits (Figure 1B), along with the increased consumption of asparagine (Figure 1C), indicated that the asparagine pathway was likely to play a significant role in the phenotypic changes observed inS. marcescensunder reduced gravity LSMMG conditions. 2.2.S. marcescensgrowth is affected by L-asparaginase treatment in vitro under simulated microgravity conditions 2.3. Injection of LSMMGS. marcescenswith in vivo L-asparaginase treatment reduces lethality in theD. melanogasterhost 2.4. Both aspartate and glutamine supplementation in combination are required in minimal media to recapitulate the asparagine pathway gene expression changes seen in rich media Next, we examined the effect of specific amino acids that are substrates in the asparagine synthesis pathway, on bacterial growth kinetics and gene expression. To do this, we grewS. marcescensin a minimal media supplemented with glutamine, aspartate, or both amino acids together, in LSMMG and in the RWV-Control. For all amino acid growth measures, there was no significant difference between the LSMMG and RWV-ControlS. marcescens, except for the aspartate-supplemented sample at 24 h (Figure 3D, F = 1.76, P = 0.0023). This suggests that aspartate in isolation is sufficient to stimulate the LSMMG-specific increase in growth. Growth and gene expression changes of LSMMG-treatedS. marcescensin Davis minimal media supplemented with amino acids. Starting concentration of 1 × 108CFU ofS. marcescenswas placed in a 10 mL rotating wall vessel at 37 °C, containing A) Davis minimal media only, B) Davis minimal media supplemented with 10 mM aspartate and 10 mM glutamine, C) Davis minimal media supplemented with 10 mM glutamine, and D) Davis minimal media supplemented with 10 mM aspartate. Growth was measured every 24 h for 72 h. E) At the end of growth period, gene expression for each sample was measured via qPCR::L-ap(L-asparaginase), L-ap1 (L-asparaginase 1),L-ap2(L-asparaginase 2),asnB(asparagine synthetase B),iaaA(isoaspartyl peptidase/L-asparaginase), orastL(asparagine tRNA ligase). Expression values are reported as fold change in LSMMG relative to the Davis minimal media values and calculated using the ΔΔ Ct method. Even though aspartate addition increases growth in LSMMG cultures butasnBandL-apgenes are overexpressed in LSMMG compared to control only when both glutamine and aspartate are present. However, when we looked at how these growth conditions influenced gene expression, the expression level of 38.95 relative to the RWV-control was significantly higher for the geneasnB(asparagine synthetaseB) in the combined glutamine and aspartate supplemented media but not in the media with either glutamine or aspartate alone (Figure 3E, P < 0.0001). Similarly, the geneL-ap(L-asparaginase) with a relative expression value of 21.45 was significantly higher in the combined media than in the glutamine or aspartate media alone (P < 0.0001). There was no significant difference across media conditions for the other genes tested:L-ap1(L-asparaginase 1),L-ap2(L-asparaginase 2),iaaA(isoaspartyl peptidase/L-asparaginase), orastL(asparagine tRNA ligase). This suggests that while aspartate alone can increase the growth ofS. marcescensin LSMMG in minimal media, the presence of both aspartate and glutamine are necessary to induce the LSMMG-specific overexpression ofasnBat a similar level to the nutrient-rich media (Figure 1B andFigure 3E). 2.5. Maximal host mortality rates ofD. melanogasterare seen only when minimal media is supplemented with aspartate and glutamine, substrates of asparagine synthesis In this study, we provide evidence for the importance of nutrient utilization during bacterial growth as a factor for increased host mortality after pathogen growth in LSMMG. Host mortality is a direct measure of pathogen virulence, and therefore an increased rate of host death is one indication of increased virulence of a pathogen [40]. While there are studies showing an increase in virulence of pathogens after exposure to spaceflight and simulated microgravity, the specific mechanisms that underlie these changes are largely unknown. In our previous study [11], we found thatS. marcescensin spaceflight and in LSMMG show an increase in virulence via increased rate of host mortality, and that thein vivogrowth of the pathogen after infection of the host is higher from both spaceflight and LSMMG treated bacteria. Whilein vivogrowth is only an indirect proxy for virulence, faster pathogen growth immediately following infection is often linked to the ability of the pathogen to overcome host immunity and sustain infection [41,42]. Therefore it was necessary for us to examine in more detail the specific potential mechanisms for increased virulence ofS. marcescensin LSMMG. First we looked at several genes involved in flagella formation, membrane-bound proteins, and known virulence genes, and did not see significant upregulation in LSMMG compared to the control (Table 3). We therefore looked at other genes linked to bacterial growth mechanisms, and found that genes related to amino acid metabolism were upregulated in LSMMG (Figure 1B). We found that several genes within the asparagine synthesis pathway were overexpressed in LSMMG, but specifically saw the largest overexpression, an almost 40-fold increase, in the asparagine synthetase B (asnBgene). Asparagine synthetase B is an enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of asparagine using aspartate, and glutamine as a nitrogen source [43,44]. The deletion of theasnBgene leads to a slow-growth phenotype in the pathogenBacillus subtilis, and in most pathogens (includingS. marcescens) is the main gene involved in asparagine biosynthesis [45]. This gene has not been implicated previously inS. marcescensvirulence, but has been shown to mediate virulence and resistance to drugs in other bacterial pathogens [36,37]. While this gene and others in amino acid uptake pathways are important for growth and division of the cell, they are also important mediators of host-pathogen interactions [38]. While the host utilizes amino acid metabolism to support defense responses against a pathogen, conversely, the pathogen can modulate amino acid metabolism for its own advantage [38]. Therefore, amino acid utilization and assimilation mechanisms can be important mediators of infection at the host-pathogen interface, and asparagine metabolism has been linked to virulence and resistance of some pathogens to antibiotics [36,37,38]. In this study we characterize the underlying indicators for the increased host mortality that we previously reported after infection with microgravity-treatedS. marcescens[11]. We show thatS. marcescensgrown in LSMMG consume key amino acids glutamine and asparagine at a faster rate than the control (Figure 1C, D), suggesting that the LSMMG might be priming these pathogens to compete with responding host immune cells for extracellular amino acids necessary for proliferation. In fact, this is the method by which some pathogens are successful colonizers of their hosts. The virulence of pathogenFrancisella tularensisis dependent on the pathogen's ability to replicate inside the host and escape from macrophages [46]. Asparagine acquisition is critical in this pathogen's success in replicating inside the host cell, where they use the host as a substrate for asparagine and aspartate necessary to replicate [46]. Similarly,S. marcescenshas been shown to have the ability to survive and proliferate inside non-phagocytic host cells, suggesting that there may be a similar mechanism of host-pathogen competition for amino acids [47]. We see in our study that growth in LSMMG increases the expression ofasnB(Figure 1B), implying an increased consumption of aspartate and glutamine to synthesize asparagine more efficiently, that may allow these pathogens to out-compete host immune cells for amino acids during infection. The presence of both aspartate and glutamine causes a significant overexpression ofasnB, even when they are the only amino acids present in minimal media (Figure 3E). This suggests that these two amino acid substrates, which are both required for asparagine synthesis, are important for LSMMG-induced overexpression ofasnB. Therefore, we believe that the LSMMG-induced increase in pathogen virulence may be mediated by the ability ofS. marcescensto utilize asparagine more efficiently within the host after infection, although further studies are needed to evaluate howS. marcescensreared in LSMMG are specifically interacting with the host's immune cells. We also found evidence that there is an overexpression of some L-asparaginase subunits, including L-asparaginase (Figure 3E andFigure 1B) whenasnBis overexpressed in the presence of its substrates, aspartate and glutamine. The homeostatic maintenance of the asparagine pathway consists of the anabolic and catabolic processes catalyzed by asnB and L-ap respectively which could result in the upregulation of both enzymes with increased asparagine metabolism. InSalmonella typhimuriuminfections, it has been shown that L-asparaginase suppresses T-cell responses by suppressing T-cell blastogenesis, proliferation, and cytokine production in the host, and that this effect could be attenuated by treatment with L-asparagine [48]. This highlights the fact that asparagine can be a key amino acid both for mammalian immune responses to bacterial pathogens, and is also important for bacterial growth and virulence properties. In this study, we provide evidence that the asparagine pathway is a critical determinant of the LSMMG-dependent increase in host mortality induced byS. marcescens. The datasets generated during and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on request. 4.1.D. melanogasterfly strains Fly lines were maintained in a 12-hour light-dark cycle on cornmeal-agar media (torula yeast, dextrose, cornmeal, agar, Tegosept, propionic acid, ethanol) at ambient temperature (∼24 °C). Fly line used in this study was obtained from the Bloomington Stock Center,w1118(#3605). 4.2. Growth ofS. marcescensDb11 in rotating wall vessel (RWV) S. marcescensDb11 were taken from stock cultures frozen at -80 °C in Copan Cryovials and were grown in sterile 50 mL conical tubes at 37 °C in liquid LB media containing 100 μg/mL streptomycin for 24 h. Liquid subcultures were then diluted down to A600 of 0.100 in LB media and loaded into a sterile 10 mL rotating wall vessel (Synthecon). The RWV simulates microgravity by rotating at a speed and orientation which keeps cells suspended in liquid without bubbles and simulates the weightlessness that cells experience during spaceflight [24] and this is referred to as the LSMMG treatment. When using the RWV to induce LSMMG, the vessel is rotated with an axis of rotation that is perpendicular to the orientation of the gravity vector and the rotation offsets the sedimental effects of gravity and keeps the cells in continuous suspension (LSMMG). In contrast, in the control orientation (RWV-Control), the axis of rotation is parallel to the gravity vector and does not offset the sedimentation induced by Earth's gravitational force. Thus, in the RWV-Control, the cells can settle at the bottom of the container and experience Earth gravity (1g), thereby acting as a control for any potential biological effects of the container vessel itself [19]. Air bubbles were removed from the vessel and vessels were sealed. Pairs of RWV were then placed in either vertical (simulated microgravity) or horizontal (normal gravity, or RWV-Control) orientation at 37 °C and rotated at 25 rpm (as in Nickerson et al. [19]). Samples were grown for 24 h to ensure that stationary phase was reached. 4.3. Asparagine and glutamine quantification At 6 and 14 h of growth, 200 μl of sample was taken from the RWV using a sterile 2 mL syringe, and the sample was used per manufacturer protocol to estimate abundances of L-asparagine and L-glutamine. The sample removed from the RWV was replaced with sterile PBS, and any air bubbles were removed before resuming rotation. The entire sample removal procedure took less than 5 min. For enzymatic tests, we used the L-Asparagine/L-Glutamine/Ammonia Assay Kit (Megazyme) following the manufacturer's recommendations and using asparagine or glutamine (final concentration 0.6 mM) as substrates. Enzymatic activities were measured by following the disappearance of the NADPH from the buffer along time as an indirect indication of asparagine deamination at 340 nm using a microplate reader (VERSAmax microplate reader, Molecular Devices). Experiments were performed in three independent replicates. 4.4. Growth ofS. marcescenswith L-asparaginase Stocks of Db11 were prepared for growth in RWV as described above in either vertical (simulated microgravity with axis of rotation being perpendicular to the gravity vector) or horizontal (normal gravity RWV-control orientation with the axis of rotation being parallel to the gravity vector) orientations at 37 °C and rotated at 25 rpm (as in Nickerson et al. [19]). One hundred microliters of L-asparaginase (Millipore Sigma) suspended in sterile water was added to the growth media for half of the vessels, and the other half received only 100 μl of the sterile water. Growth of the bacteria was estimated by absorbance at 600 nm and was measured every 3 h. Samples were grown for 24 h total to ensure that stationary phase was reached. The sample removed from the RWV for quantification was replaced with sterile PBS, and any air bubbles were removed before resuming rotation. These experiments were run in three independent replicates. S. marcescensin the stationary phase were preserved at -80 °C in 10 mL of 20% glycerol. Concentrations of samples for injections were determined by performing colony counts ofSerratiain different concentrations of PBS on LB plates. The PBS source without added bacteria was plated as a negative control for contamination. Based on these colony counts, samples were then diluted to 4 × 105CFU/mL in sterile PBS for injections. For infections and survival, the Nanoject II (Drummond Scientific) was used with the 32 nL injection volume setting as described previously by our laboratory [11]. Concentrations were adjusted so that each injection was approximately 10 CFU/fly. A total of 180 flies were injected, with 60 total flies assigned to each bacterial treatment group. Control bacteria, simulated microgravity-treated bacteria, or a glycerol sham were then injected into the 30 anesthetized 2-3 day-old males and 30 females (post-eclosion)D. melanogasterin the ventral abdomen near the seventh/eighth segment. One hour later, half of those flies (15 per sex) were injected with 32 nL L-asparaginase. After injections, flies were kept at 25 °C on the same standard dextrose food that they were reared on, and survival was monitored every hour for at least 24 h. These experiments were repeated in three independent replicates. 4.6. Growth in Davis minimal media supplemented with amino acids Bacteria were prepared using the protocol previously mentioned, but Davis Minimal Media supplemented with 10 mM of aspartate, glutamine, or a 50/50 mixture of aspartate and glutamine was used in place of LB broth. To quantify growth, 20 μl of sample diluted in 180 μl of PBS was read at an absorbance of A600 every 24 h for 72 h. To keep the volume of the RWV consistent, 20 μl of sterile PBS was placed in each vessel to make up for the volume lost during sampling. These experiments were repeated in three independent replicates.S. marcescensin the stationary phase were preserved at -80 °C in 10 mL of 20% glycerol. Concentrations of samples for injections were determined by performing colony counts ofSerratiain different concentrations of PBS on LB plates. The PBS source without added bacteria were plated as a negative control for contamination. Based on these colony counts, samples were then diluted to 4 × 105CFU/mL in sterile PBS for injections. For infections and survival, the Nanoject II (Drummond Scientific) was used with the 32 nL injection volume setting as described previously by our laboratory [11]. Concentrations were adjusted so that each injection was approximately 10 CFU/fly. A total of 30 flies (15 males and 15 females) were infected with each experimental sample, including 30 total flies injected with a glycerol sham. These experiments were repeated in three independent replicates. 4.7. Expression analysis of amino acid genes Samples were diluted to 1 × 108cells and pelleted, and RNA was extracted from pelleted samples using the RNEasy® Mini Kit (Qiagen). cDNA was generated using the RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Scientific). Relative gene expression levels were quantified using the 7500 Real Time PCR instrument from Applied Biosystems and SYBR™ Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Primers were designed with Primer-Blast, NCBI. Real-time cycler conditions were; 95 °C for 15 min for initial activation step, and 40 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s for denaturation, annealing, and extension respectively. Data were normalized to the reference generecA. These experiments were repeated in three independent replicates, including RNA extraction from three independent growth trials and three qPCR runs of each sample (9 total plates). Additionally, each plate (replicate) contained 6 identical wells which were averaged to give a mean CTvalue of a given gene, ensuring that any pipetting errors were minimized in the data.
