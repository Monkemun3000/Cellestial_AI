  "content": "Effect of spaceflight onPseudomonas aeruginosafinal cell density is modulated by nutrient and oxygen availability Received 2013 Jun 4; Accepted 2013 Oct 15; Collection date 2013. Here, we have explored how phosphate concentration, carbon source, oxygen availability, and motility affect the growth ofPseudomonas aeruginosain modified artificial urine media during spaceflight. We observed thatP. aeruginosagrown during spaceflight exhibited increased final cell density relative to normal gravity controls when low concentrations of phosphate in the media were combined with decreased oxygen availability. In contrast, when the availability of either phosphate or oxygen was increased, no difference in final cell density was observed between spaceflight and normal gravity. Because motility has been suggested to affect how microbes respond to microgravity, we compared the growth of wild-typeP. aeruginosato aΔmotABCD mutant deficient in swimming motility. However, the final cell densities observed with the motility mutant were consistent with those observed with wild type for all conditions tested. Benoit and Klaus have suggested that differences in motility may be responsible for some of these inconsistent observations [14]. They hypothesize non-motile bacteria have an advantage under spaceflight conditions due to a lack of cell settling and the resulting increases in local nutrient availability in the well-mixed environment, while motile cells are able to move actively towards nutrients under both normal and microgravity conditions [14]. Indeed, a previous spaceflight experiment, conducted by Thévenetet al.,found that growth in microgravity increased the final cell density of a non-motileE. colimutant lackingmotBrelative to normal gravity, while no differences were observed with the motile parent [9]. However, further studies are needed to examine whether motility plays a universal role in affecting microbial growth in microgravity. Recent studies have also indicated that media conditions can modulate how microgravity affects bacterial physiology [15-17].Salmonellacultured in Lennox broth (LB) during spaceflight exhibited increased virulence in a murine model of infection compared to controls whereSalmonellawas grown on Earth. However, the use of M9 media or the addition of the inorganic ion components of M9 to LB was observed to mitigate the enhanced virulence ofSalmonellainduced during spaceflight [15]. A set of follow-up experiments tested the individual components of M9 and showed that the addition of phosphate alone to LB could prevent the increase in acid tolerance observed whenSalmonellais grown in low shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) [15]. In addition to phosphate, oxygen availability may also influence how bacteria grow and respond to the spaceflight environment. For example, oxygen is known to affect many aspects of the growth and physiology ofPseudomonas aeruginosa, a facultative anaerobe, including growth, motility, and biofilm formation [18-20].P. aeruginosais an opportunistic human pathogen and was attributed to the spaceflight infection of an astronaut during Apollo 13 [21,22]. We recently examined biofilm formation byP. aeruginosaPA14, a virulent clinical isolate [23], and shown that differences in biofilm biomass observed between spaceflight and normal gravity can be minimized when oxygen availability is increased [24]. Modeling efforts have suggested that oxygen transfer rates may be decreased under LSMMG conditions compared to normal gravity conditions [16], and a number of genes involved in anaerobic metabolism were found to be up-regulated whenP. aeruginosaPAO1, a less virulent laboratory reference strain [25,26], was grown during spaceflight [17]. These findings indicate that oxygen availability may influence bacterial responses to spaceflight, and highlight the interplay between changes in the environment due to the direct or indirect effects of microgravity, such as reduced oxygen transport, and changes in microbial physiology. However, previous studies have not examined changes in the response of planktonic cells to the spaceflight environment when oxygen availability is varied. We have investigated the effects of phosphate concentration, carbon source, oxygen availability and swimming motility on the final cell density ofP. aeruginosaPA14 grown during spaceflight. Here, we demonstrate that the final cell density ofP. aeruginosais increased during spaceflight when culture conditions limit the availability of substrates required for growth. Specifically, growth during spaceflight led to an increase in final cell density whenP. aeruginosawas cultured under low phosphate and low oxygen conditions. Increased availability of either phosphate or oxygen was observed to minimize the effects of spaceflight on the final cell density. These findings indicate that effects of gravity on final cell density can be modulated by the availability of growth-limiting substrates. Two assays of final cell density show inconsistent measurements of spaceflight and normal gravity cultures grown in specialized hardware Cultures were grown following the experiment timeline shown in Figure1. Prior to inoculation, the FPAs were stored at 8°C. Following inoculation, cells were cultured at 37°C for 72 h. A subset of the cultures were fixed with paraformaldehyde immediately following the 72 h culture period and all cultures were subsequently incubated at 8°C for approximately 48 h. This 48 h period corresponds to the time required for the shuttle to return to Earth, and storage at 8°C during this period minimized additional cell growth of viable cultures and increased the stability of the fixed samples [6,33]. Plate counting was conducted immediately following shuttle landing to determine the number of viable cells in the live samples. The paraformaldehyde-fixed samples were stained with DAPI and cell numbers were determined by flow cytometry (FCM). Timeline of spaceflight experiments.Four days before Shuttle launch (L-4): Media were loaded into FPAs. L-3: Inocula were loaded. L-2: After checking for contamination, 9% (w/v) paraformaldehyde fixative was loaded for FCM samples only. Samples were stored at ambient temperature (AT) from L-4 to L-1. L-1: After a final contamination check, samples were loaded into the CGBA and stored at 8°C. F0: Space Shuttle Atlantis launched. F8: Samples were activated by mixing the media with the inocula. The temperature in the CGBA was increased to 37°C. F11: Samples were terminated by the addition of fixative (FCM samples only) 72 h after activation. The temperature in the CGBA was reduced to 8°C. F13: Space Shuttle Atlantis landed. Ground controls were conducted at Kennedy Space Center in parallel with spaceflight samples. Comparison of plate counting and FCM measurements of microbial growth during spaceflight.Wild-typeP. aeruginosawas cultured under normal gravity (black bars) and spaceflight (gray bars) conditions in mAUMg containing 5 mM or 50 mM phosphate.(a)The number of viable cells in unfixed samples was measured by plate counting.(b)The number of cells in fixed samples was measured by flow cytometry (FCM). Statistical differences between normal gravity and spaceflight for each experimental condition were analyzed by one-tailed t-test: *p< 0.05. Error bars indicate SD; N = 3. Phosphate availability modulates the effect of spaceflight on final cell density P. aeruginosagrown in mAUM during spaceflight exhibited a modest, but significant, 1.5-fold increase in final cell density compared to normal gravity controls (p <0.01,one-tailed t-test) (Figure4(a)). We also measured final cell densities in mAUM where the concentration of phosphate was increased from 5 mM, which is the concentration found in normal human urine [32], to 50 mM (mAUM-high Pi). In the case of mAUM-high Pi, no difference in the final cell density was observed between spaceflight and normal gravity (Figure4(a)). Effect of spaceflight on final cell density ofP. aeruginosa.Wild-typeP. aeruginosaand a motility mutant (ΔmotABCD) were cultured under normal gravity (black bars) and spaceflight conditions (gray bars) in FPAs with(a)solid inserts or(b)GE inserts. Cells were cultured in mAUM or mAUMg containing 5 mM or 50 mM phosphate. Final cell density was measured by FCM. Effect of phosphate on final cell density is significant in FPAs with solid inserts [two-way ANOVA, ♦♦p< 0.01]. Effect of gravity on final cell density is significant in 5 mM phosphate conditions in FPAs with solid inserts [two-way ANOVA,p< 0.01]. Statistical differences between spaceflight and normal gravity for each experimental condition was analyzed by one-tailed t-test: **p< 0.01; *p< 0.05. Error bars indicate SD; N = 3. Oxygen availability modulates the effect of spaceflight on final cell density Role of swimming motility on spaceflight final cell density We also examined the effects of spaceflight on a motility mutant,ΔmotABCD,which lacks the motor proteins required for flagella-mediated swimming [40]. In mAUMg,ΔmotABCDcultured during spaceflight showed a 3-fold increase in final cell density compared to its normal gravity counterpart (p< 0.05, one-tailed t-test), while in mAUMg-high Pi there was no difference in final cell density (Figure4(a)). We also culturedΔmotABCDwith GE inserts and observed no difference in the final cell density between spaceflight and normal gravity controls, regardless of phosphate availability (Figure4(b)). Overall, we did not observe any significant differences between the final cell density of wild-typeP. aeruginosaand the non-motile mutant under any of our experimental conditions (p >0.05, three-way ANOVA; factors: gravity, phosphate, motility). Microscopy of planktonic cells does not show aggregation ofP. aeruginosaPA14 Increases in aggregation and clumping of planktonic cells have been observed forSalmonellagrown during spaceflight [13] andP. aeruginosaPAO1 grown in LSMMG [41]. To assess whether spaceflight conditions induced cellular aggregation in our spaceflight experiments, we observed the fixedP. aeruginosaPA14 planktonic cells by differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy. Interestingly, no clumps or aggregates with more than ~3 cells were observed following growth in mAUM with 5 or 50 mM phosphate during spaceflight or on Earth (Figure5), or under any of the other media conditions tested (data not shown). Absence of aggregation by planktonic cells grown in FPAs.Representative images obtained by DIC microscopy of paraformaldehyde-fixedP. aeruginosacells grown in mAUM containing 5 mM phosphate (top) or 50 mM phosphate (bottom) during normal gravity and spaceflight. Scale bar is 10 μm. We have systematically studied the effects of spaceflight on the final cell density ofP. aeruginosa,assessing factors known to affect bacterial growth such as phosphate and oxygen availability, carbon source and motility. We have demonstrated that differences between final cell density ofP. aeruginosacultured during spaceflight and on Earth are dependent on nutrient and oxygen availability. Specifically, spaceflight increased the final cell density ofP. aeruginosawhen it was grown with low phosphate and low oxygen availability. When either phosphate or oxygen availability was increased, no difference between normal gravity and spaceflight was observed. Similar to previous observations that increasing phosphate concentration or supplementing media with the inorganic ion components of M9 media, which includes phosphate, can minimize the effects of spaceflight or LSMMG on virulence and acid tolerance ofSalmonella[15], we observed that increasing the phosphate concentration from 5 to 50 mM in the artificial urine media minimized the differences between spaceflight and normal gravity final cell densities ofP. aeruginosa. Berryet al., have also shown that phosphate uptake bySaccharomyces cerevisiaeincreased when cultured during spaceflight [44].Taken together, these findings may indicate that phosphate plays a key role in microbial responses to spaceflight conditions. However, additional studies are needed to determine whether phosphate is acting simply as a growth-limiting nutrient, or if the effect is more specific. While cells grown with 5 mM phosphate are not likely to be starved for this essential nutrient, increasing phosphate concentration has been shown to increase the growth rate ofP. aeruginosa[45]. We also observed that using GE inserts minimized differences between final cell concentrations following growth under normal and microgravity. Similarly, Wilsonet al., did not observe any difference in final cell concentration between spaceflight and normal gravity whenSalmonellawas cultured in FPAs with GE inserts, as measured by FCM [13,15,17]. While we observed that the use of GE inserts was advantageous for bacteria grown in normal gravity, no additional increases were observed for spaceflight cultures when the solid inserts were replaced with the GE inserts. This may be attributed to a lower oxygen transfer rate in microgravity, as described previously for LSMMG [16]. Indeed, studies ofP. aeruginosaPAO1 gene expression have indicated that growth in FPAs is likely microaerophilic or anaerobic even with the GE inserts and that differences in oxygen gradients within the FPAs likely exist between normal gravity and spaceflight conditions [17]. We have recently observed that the use of GE inserts also minimized differences inP. aeruginosaPA14 biofilm growth between normal and spaceflight conditions [24]. In that case, we did see increases in biofilm biomass in spaceflight samples with GE inserts. However, the proximity of the biofilm substrate to the GE inserts ensured that any additional oxygen was delivered directly to the growing biofilm cells. Overall, these findings highlight the role that environmental conditions and nutrient availability have on modulating how microbes respond to the spaceflight environment. Bacterial strains and culture media Pseudomonas aeruginosaPA14 [23] and its isogenic motility mutant,ΔmotABCD[40], were used for the current experiment. All strains were grown overnight at 37°C with shaking at 225 rpm in nutrient broth (NB) (Difco BD). To prepare inocula, cultures were washed and resuspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to a final concentration of ~6 x 106CFU/mL. The modified artificial urine medium (mAUM) used in the present study is based on the medium previously described by Brookset al.,[31]. To ensure reproducibility in media composition, RPMI 1640 amino acid solution (50x; Sigma, cat #: R7131) and L-glutamine solution (200 mM; Sigma, cat #: G7513) were substituted for peptone and yeast extract. The concentration of calcium chloride dihydrate was lowered from 2.5 mM to 0.25 mM to minimize precipitation during storage at 8°C. Sodium nitrate, 6 mM, was added to serve as a terminal electron acceptor and enable some growth under oxygen limiting conditions. Higher concentrations of sodium nitrate were avoided to minimize any effects on aerobic growth and limit the accumulation of nitrite, which can inhibit cell growth. To test the effects of carbon source, 2 mM citric acid was substituted by 2 mM glucose (mAUMg). To assess the role of phosphate availability, we used either 5 mM or 50 mM phosphate, where mAUM and mAUMg include 5 mM phosphate and mAUM-high Pi and mAUMg-high Pi contain 50 mM phosphate. The pH of all media was adjusted to 7.0. Spaceflight and ground control cultures Spaceflight and ground control cultures ofP. aeruginosawere prepared and grown in a fluid processing apparatus (FPA) as described previously [24]. To load the FPA, a 13-mm diameter mixed cellulose ester membrane disc (Millipore) was first attached to a solid or a gas exchange (GE) insert with autoclavable double-sided tape (3 M). Next, 2.5 mL of media and 0.5 mL of inoculum were sequentially loaded into two compartments separated by a rubber stopper. Due to constraints imposed by the dimensions of the bevel, approximately 0.6 mL of air remained in the compartment containing the media after loading. A third compartment, for FCM samples only, was filled with 2.4 mL of 9% w/v paraformaldehyde in PBS. Three biological replicates were prepared for each experimental condition. Eight FPAs were loaded into a single group activation pack (GAP), which enables simultaneous plunging of the rubber stoppers in each FPA, and were incubated in a Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus (CGBA) as described previously [30]. Cultures were grown following the experiment timeline shown in Figure1. Before shuttle launch, all FPAs were loaded and stored at ambient temperature for at least 48 h to check for contamination. Samples were subsequently stored at 8°C (L-1) until activation. Five days before shuttle landing, the media and inoculum were combined and incubated at 37°C for 72 h (activation). Two days before shuttle landing, the temperature was decreased to 8°C and the FCM samples were fixed with paraformaldehyde (termination). Samples were obtained approximately 6 h after shuttle landing and processed immediately. Ground controls were conducted at Kennedy Space Center in parallel with spaceflight samples. The attached membranes were separated from the liquid phase, planktonic fractions. Characterization and analysis of biofilm growth on the membranes have been reported separately [24]. One mL of the planktonic fraction was sonicated in an ultrasonic bath (Branson 2510) for 8 min to disperse any clumps of cells. The planktonic fraction was serially diluted with PBS. Samples were spot-plated on NB agar and incubated at 37°C for 18 h prior to counting. Sample preparation and flow cytometric analysis Bacterial cells fixed with paraformaldehyde were washed with PBS and stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Life Technologies) for 2 h at room temperature according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Stained samples were diluted to approximately 5 x 105– 9 x 106CFU/mL with PBS. Cell numbers were measured using a FACSAria flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) equipped with a 407 nm laser. To calculate the concentration of cells from FCM recorded events, liquid counting beads (BD Biosciences) were used following the manufacturer’s instruction. Briefly, 50 μL of the liquid counting beads was added to 1 mL of each diluted sample. The beads were detected by FCM in a separate region that does not overlap with the cells. The number of events in the cell region was recorded until one thousand events in the bead region were detected. The concentration of cells in each sample was calculated using the following equation. Effects of post-growth storage on viable cell counts and FCM data The experiments were performed using FPAs following the same timeline and temperature profile as described in Figure1. FPAs were incubated at 37°C for 72 h. Samples were either processed immediately or stored at 8°C for 48 h. To process samples, 1 mL of culture was enumerated by plate counting and a second 1 mL fraction was fixed with paraformaldehyde and enumerated by FCM. For differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy,P. aeruginosastains fixed with paraformaldehyde after experimental termination. The fixedP. aeruginosastains were observed using Olympus IX-81 inverted microscope equipped with DIC optics, 60x/1.35 oil Zeiss. All data were represented as mean ± standard deviation (S.D.) of three biological replicates. Statistical comparison of the number of cells between normal gravity and spaceflight for each different condition was conducted using a one-tailed Student’s t-test. When assessing combinations of two factors (post-growth storage and the microgravity environment, or phosphate concentration in media and microgravity) or three factors (motility, phosphate concentration in media, and microgravity), the effects of each factor and their interaction were assessed by two or three-way ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey tests using PASW Statistics18 (SPSS Inc.). Statistical significance was defined asp< 0.05. Illustration of fluid processing apparatus (FPA). Wooseong Kim, Email: kimw5@rpi.edu. Farah K Tengra, Email: fktengra@gmail.com.
