Key Words:Caenorhabditis elegans, microfluidics, hypoxia-inducible factor, cyanide toxicity, transcription factor. The free-living nematodeCaenorhabditis eleganshas proven to be an excellent model for studying the mechanisms by which animals respond to environmental signals or toxicants (Albrecht and Bargmann, 2011;Leunget al., 2008;Zurynet al., 2008). Advantages include a fully sequenced genome, genetic tractability, extensive knowledge of its development and anatomy, and ease of culture (Brenner, 1974). Behavioral analyses ofC. eleganscan be employed to assess fast-acting toxicants or pharmacological treatments that cause uncoordinated movement or paralysis. The combination of genetics and in-depth analyses of toxicant effects provides important insights to the mechanisms by which toxicants or pollutants impair animal function. There are technical challenges to assaying the effects of fast-acting aqueous toxicants. In the laboratory,C. elegansare usually cultured on agarose plates with bacterial food. If placed in a liquid droplet, the animals thrash and are difficult to image. Microfluidic devices resolve this by maintaining the animals in a single plane of focus, but animals often seek to escape chambers containing poisonous substances. To overcome these obstacles, we designed a chamber that allows mechanical insertion of individuals. We also engineered a custom port design that permits worm entry but prevents exit. Additional design modifications enable real-time imaging and chemical testing with applications for mutants that behave unpredictably in the presence of electric fields, agarose gel, or toxicants. Among the toxicants in our environment, cyanide is an especially potent poison (Beasley and Glass, 1998;Budde and Roth, 2011;Gallagher and Manoil, 2001). It is produced as a by-product of many industrial processes, chemical reactions, and even fires (Hamel, 2011). Cyanide exerts its toxic effects by irreversibly binding to iron, thereby incapacitating proteins required for aerobic respiration. This prevents normal oxygen utilization and decreases ATP production ultimately causing cellular asphyxiation and death (Beasley and Glass, 1998). Several bacteria, including the nearly ubiquitous human pathogenPseudomonas aeruginosa, produce cyanide (Blumer and Haas, 2000), and this is especially devastating to patients with compromised respiratory or immune systems. Caenorhabditis eleganslacking a functionalegl-9gene have been shown to be resistant to hydrogen cyanide (HCN) gas produced by the pathogenP. aeruginosaPAO1 (Darbyet al., 1999;Gallagher and Manoil, 2001;Shaoet al., 2010). This is especially intriguing because the EGL-9 protein functions as a cellular oxygen sensor. EGL-9 hydroxylates the HIF-1 hypoxia-inducible factor using oxygen as a cosubstrate, and this modification targets HIF-1 for degradation (Epsteinet al., 2001). The HIF-1 transcription factor controls changes in gene expression that allow animals to adapt to oxygen deprivation (Jianget al., 2001;Shenet al., 2005). Loss-of-function mutations in theC. elegans egl-9gene cause HIF-1 to be expressed at high levels and to be overactive (Bishopet al., 2004;Epsteinet al., 2001;Shenet al., 2006). This, in turn, affectsC. elegansdevelopment, stress response, longevity, and behavior (Powell-Coffman, 2010). How does a loss-of-function mutation inegl-9and the accompanying overactivation of HIF-1 protectC. elegansfrom cyanide toxicity? To address this question, we examined the roles ofegl-9,hif-1, and thecysl-2cysteine synthase gene in cyanide resistance, employing both HCN gas assays and real-time imaging in a custom microfluidic device to describe multiple parameters of these behavioral phenotypes. These experiments confirmed that mutations that confer resistance to the paralyzing effects of HCN gas also protectC. elegansfrom potassium cyanide (KCN) in the microfluidic chambers, and they illuminate the mechanisms that protectegl-9mutant worms from cyanide toxicity. Finally, we further explored and verified the broader applicability of our microfluidic device, using the anthelminthic drug levamisole. The combination of microfluidics and automated imaging increases the power ofC. elegansas a genetic model system to study the effects of toxicants or chemical interventions in real time. Caenorhabditis elegans Strains and Culture Caenorhabditis elegansstrains were grown at 20°C, on standard Nutrient Growth Media (NGM) agarose plates withEscherichia coliOP50 bacterial food, as previously described (Brenner, 1974). All experiments were performed at 20°C–22°C using L4 stage worms. The following strains were used in this study: N2 wild type, JT307 [egl-9(sa307)], ZG448iaIs07[Pnhr-57::gfp unc-119 (+)] IV; egl-9(ia60) V, ZG493iaIs07[Pnhr-57::gfp unc-119 (+)] IV; egl-9(sa330)V, ZG347iaIs07[Pnhr-57::gfp unc-119 (+)] IV; egl-9 (sa307) hif-1(ia04) V,ZG175iaIs07[Pnhr-57::gfp unc-119 (+)] IV; hif-1(ia04) V. Theegl-9(sa307)allele is a 243-bp deletion and is a strong loss-of-function mutation. Theia60mutation is a MOS1 transposon insertion in theegl-9gene, whereas thesa330allele is a C-to-T mutation that creates a nonsense codon at amino acid 38 (Darbyet al., 1999;Shaoet al., 2009). Thehif-1(ia04)mutation is a 1231-bp deletion of the second, third, and fourth exons, which causes a frameshift and premature stop in the mutant mRNA (Jianget al., 2001). (a) Setup for the HCN gas assay: (i) unseeded NGM plate with L4 stage worms and, in a separate plate, aliquots of (ii) hydrochloric acid and (iii) KCN dissolved in sodium hydroxide. The liquids were mixed to generate HCN gas. The larger petri dish (iv) formed the chamber and was sealed with Parafilm to prevent any gas leakage. Scale bar = 20mm. (b) The microfluidic device (v) was observed under a stereomicroscope connected with a camera and computer. (c) Image of the actual PDMS microfluidic device bonded on a glass slide. Scale bar = 10mm. (d) Magnified image of three microfluidic chambers (vii) in which the worms were assayed; each chamber having its individual port (vi) through which the worms and chemical solutions are introduced. Scale bar = 1.5mm. At each time point, animals were scored as being motile, nonmotile, or having limited motility (Fig. 1a). The line denotes the track of the worm body centroid over a period of 22 s. “Motile” worms (Fig. 1a.i) foraged actively on the plates on their own accord, without any need for tapping or prodding with a pick. Worms that showed slight movements of their head and body were scored as having “limited motility” (Fig. 1a.ii). Worms were scored as “nonmotile” (Fig. 1a.iii) if they lay immobile on the plates and did not move despite tapping the plate and prodding with a pick. Caenorhabditis eleganssusceptibility to HCN gas. (a) Worms were scored as being motile, having limited motility or being nonmotile at 30-min time points for a total of 150min of HCN exposure, followed by 2h recovery in room air (number of animals = 60 and number of independent trials = 3). In these photos, the line traces the movement of a representative animal over 22 s. (b) Wild-type N2 animals were rapidly immobilized by HCN gas and did not recover over the span of the assay. (c)egl-9(sa307)mutant animals remained motile in the presence of HCN gas. (d) Theegl-9(sa307) hif-1(ia04)double mutants showed a decrease in motility similar to wild type and did not recover. HCN slowedegl-9(ia60)(e) andegl-9(sa330)(f) mutants, but the animals were able to recover motility to a large extent after 2h in room air. RNAi experiments were performed as previously described (Kamathet al., 2000). L4 stage worms were fed either HT115 bacteria with empty vector L4440 (negative control), HT115 bacteria with the vector expressingegl-9(positive control fed to wild-type worms), or HT115 bacteria with the vector expressingcysl-2(Shenet al., 2006). Animals were fed the RNAi food for two generations before conducting the experiments. TRIzol (Invitrogen) was used to isolate RNA from synchronized populations of L4 stage worms. The total extracted RNA from each sample was treated with DNase (Promega) and then reverse transcribed into complimentary DNA (cDNA) using Oligo (dT18) primers and AffinityScript reverse transcriptase (Stratagene). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using SYBR GREEN supermix (Bio-Rad) and each reaction used cDNA from 100ng of total RNA. The primers for K10H10.2 andinf-1have been previously published (Shenet al., 2005,2006). Three biological replicates were analyzed for each experiment. Additionally, each PCR reaction was performed in duplicate. The standard curve method was used to analyze the expression levels (Larionovet al., 2005). Microfluidic Assay With Cyanide in Aqueous Solution Fabrication of microfluidic chip. The microfluidic chips were fabricated using a standard soft-lithography process (Carret al., 2011a,b;Parasharet al., 2011). The device design was drawn in AutoCAD and sent out to an outside vendor (Fineline Imaging) for printing the black-and-white masks. After obtaining the masks from the vendor, a UV-sensitive polymer, SU-8, was spin coated on a 3-in. silicon wafer to create an 80-µm thick layer. The SU-8 was patterned with the features on the physical mask and developed. Then polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) polymer was poured on the SU-8 master and allowed to dry in a low-pressure chamber. The dried PDMS was peeled off the SU-8 master, punched with holes for the fluidic ports, and irreversibly bonded to a standard glass slide (Fig. 2c). System setup and real-time imaging. The microfluidic chip was mechanically secured to the microscope stage using a plastic tape. For the control experiments, Tygon microbore tubing (inner diameter = 0.51mm, outer diameter = 1.52mm) was connected to a syringe and each chamber was filled with a suspension of M9 buffer andE. coliOP50 bacteria through the input port (Fig. 2d). The final concentration ofE. colisuspension was maintained at 0.2 OD (optical density). For the cyanide experiments, we used 0.5mM KCN in M9 buffer along with bacterial suspension. For levamisole experiments, we used the drug solutions prepared in M9 buffer at concentrations of 0, 0.1, 1, 10, and 100µM. Single L4 stage worms were picked using a sterile platinum wire pick and dropped into the input port. A small amount of pressure was applied at the input port to push a single worm into each chamber. Once all three chambers were occupied by three individual worms, images were recorded for a period of 1000 s at the rate of one image per second. The saved videos were analyzed for extraction of the multiple locomotion parameters. To facilitate real-time imaging of worm movement, we used a Leica MZ16 transmission stereozoom microscope that has a wide field of view (to record multiple chambers) and 35-mm working distance (for fluidic handling). The microscope has 1× and 2× objective lenses that enabled 7.1× to 230× range of magnification, which was adequate for the experiments. The microscope was coupled with a QICam 12-bit Mono Fast 1394 cooled digital camera interfacing with QCapture PRO software. This allowed us to capture digital images (1392×1040 pixels) at a specified time interval (typically 1 s). The images from a recorded experiment were appended in sequence and compressed into the Audio Video Interleave (.avi) video format. Data acquisition and analysis. The saved video files were postprocessed by our custom worm tracking program (Carret al., 2011b;Parasharet al., 2011) that identified moving objects and tracked their location over a period of time. The source code was written in the C++ programming language. The program analyzed a series of images (typically 1000) to identify the body centroid of an individual worm and record the centroid’s changing coordinates over the length of the video. The program was able to track the body centroid for worms moving forward, backward, or having paused for a period of time. The output of the tracking program was a Microsoft Excel workbook with series of x- and y- position coordinates of the body centroid. A custom Graphic User Interface (GUI) program, written in MATLAB, further allowed the user to calculate and plot the locomotion parameters from multiple data files. GraphPad Prism (GraphPad), JMP, and SAS software were used for statistical analyses of the generated data (Sallet al., 2005;SAS Institute, 2011). Overactivation of HIF-1 Confers Resistance to HCN Gas Partial Loss-of-Function Mutations in egl-9 Confer Intermediate Resistance Phenotypes Prior genetic studies had isolated and characterized several different mutations inegl-9. Severe loss-of-function mutations, such asegl-9(sa307), had been shown to cause egg-laying defects and dramatic overexpression of numerous HIF-1 targets (Darbyet al., 1999;Shaoet al., 2009;Shenet al., 2006;Trentet al., 1983). With respect to these phenotypes, the defects conferred by theegl-9(sa330)andegl-9(ia60)mutations have been shown to be less severe (Darbyet al., 1999;Shaoet al., 2009). We tested the hypothesis that animals carrying theegl-9(sa330)oregl-9(ia60)mutations would have less resistance to HCN gas compared withegl-9(sa307). As seen inFigures 1eand1f, these less severe mutations resulted in an intermediate resistance phenotype. By 2.5h of exposure to the cyanide gas, these mutants were unable to actively forage on the plates. When left to recover from HCN gas exposure, they soon regained their motility. Design of the Microfluidic Device We proceeded to design a microfluidic chip suitable for assaying small, fast-acting toxicants. Unfortunately, existing devices were not optimal for KCN toxicity studies, so the design of a novel chip proved crucial to our experiments. In prior studies, we had fabricated microfluidic devices to measure the dose-dependent effects of levamisole (an anthelminthic drug) on the movement ofC. elegansin real time and at high resolution (Carret al., 2011b). Even though these devices were later tested with other anthelmintic drugs, they could not be adopted for cyanide assays because of three main obstacles. First, they relied upon an electric field to guide the worms (i.e., electrotaxis), and an electric field would dissociate KCN molecules. In addition, some mutants of interest were not as sensitive to the applied electric fields as the wild-typeC. elegans. Initial tests indicated that electrotaxis ofegl-9mutants required electric fields at higher voltage ranges (10–12V) that incapacitate wild-type worms. Second, it was difficult to contain the free-moving worms within the previously constructed microfluidic chamber in the presence of cyanide. We observed that worms responded quickly to KCN solution by trying to escape the chamber, and they explored potential points of exit. In many cases, within a few minutes of cyanide application, worms were found swimming on the liquid surface in the exit ports. Third, agarose was not a suitable medium for observing worm movement, particularly foregl-9mutants. These mutants frequently paused in agarose-filled microfluidic chambers, sometimes for as long as 20min of observation. We also developed and tested alternate devices with soil-like pillar structures (Lockeryet al., 2008), but theegl-9mutants paused in between the pillars. The custom chip that we designed for this study overcomes these obstacles. It enables the worms to move freely in aqueous solutions but does not allow them to escape. The chip was designed to have nine chambers, wherein three chambers were used simultaneously during an experimental run (Figs. 2cand2d). The dimensions of the chambers (length = 3.5mm, width = 1.8mm, and height = 80 µm) were chosen to fit the field of view of the microscope under a suitable magnification with sufficient volume to allow for freeC. elegansswimming while also maintaining the animals in a single plane of focus. Each chamber, in turn, had a one-way input port with a tapered neck (width = 25 µm and height = 80 µm) for sample injection (Fig. 2d). This design allowed us to simply push the worms into the chamber from one side but prevented them from escaping back through the port. Presence of Food as an Essential Factor for Consistent Worm Movement Effects of cyanide on worm velocity in the microfluidic assay. (a) In this diagram, the red-dotted line denotes the representative path of the body centroid. The velocity was calculated using the worm’s centroid positions [(x1,y1) and (x2,y2)] at their two successive time instances (t1andt2). (b–f) Average velocity of body centroid in control (blue) and 0.5mM liquid cyanide (red) conditions. In all the plots, the centroid velocity was calculated by taking the average of all instantaneous velocities of all animals (number of animals = 15 and number of independent trials = 7). Multiparameter Behavioral Analysis in Aqueous Cyanide Solution To more completely and accurately define the effects of KCN on wild-type and mutant animals, we used real-time imaging ofC. elegansin microfluidic chambers to address the following questions: Are the effects of KCN immediate, or doC. elegansslow down over time? What is the range of velocities exhibited by a population in the presence of the toxicant? Do our data support the hypothesis that mutations that protectC. elegansfrom HCN gas also protect the animals from aqueous KCN? Average velocity of body centroid. Total distance covered by the body centroid. Total distance traveled in the microfluidic chambers. (a–c) Examples of tracks of animals differently affected by the toxicant. (a) Tracks representative of wild-type animals that exhibited periods of limited motility and eventually ceased movement. (b) Tracks representative of theegl-9(ia60)andegl-9(sa330)animals that exhibited periods of limited motility in the presence of the toxicant but did not become immotile. (c) Tracks representative ofegl-9(sa307)animals that continued to swim around the chamber throughout the experiment. (d) The average distance travelled by the worms within 1000 s of recording is shown (number of animals = 15 and number of independent trials = 7). *p< 0.0002, two-way ANOVA. Do the cyanide-induced decreases in distance traveled reflect a slow-moving worm with uniform velocity or a relatively fast-moving worm that pauses intermittently? Is the answer the same for all individuals in a population? To address these questions, we examined the movement patterns of individual animals (Fig. 5). We also calculated mean velocities for each condition (Fig. 6), and we quantified the times that worms were immotile (Fig. 7). Behavioral raster plots of the centroid velocities. In our color scheme, white color denotes a maximum velocity of 500 µm/s and black color denotes a minimum velocity of 0 µm/s. Within every raster plot, each individual row corresponds to a distinct animal that is tracked for 1000 s and the color intensity of each pixel corresponds to the animal’s instantaneous velocity (number of animals = 15 and number of independent trials = 7). The wild-type andegl-9(sa307) hif-1(ia04)double mutants show a distinctly slower velocity in cyanide solution (as shown by a darker raster) compared with that in control conditions. Theegl-9(sa307)mutants had similar velocities in both control and experimental conditions (as shown by a lighter raster). Range and distribution of the average centroid velocities.

Number of pauses in the microfluidic chambers. Pauses were counted as time instances (within the entire 1000 s) when the centroid velocity was less than a threshold velocity of 15 µm/s. (number of animals = 15 and number of independent trials = 7). Behavioral raster representation of instantaneous centroid velocity. Range and distribution of average centroid velocity. Deciphering the Role of cysl-2 in Cyanide Resistance We next investigated the role of the cysteine synthase-like genecysl-2inegl-9-mediated resistance to aqueous KCN. Overexpression of HIF-1 inegl-9mutants has been shown to cause a marked increase in the expression ofcysl-2/K10H10.2mRNA (Budde and Roth, 2011;Shaoet al., 2009;Shenet al., 2005,2006). Further, during the course of our studies,Budde and Roth (2011)had demonstrated that RNAi-mediated depletion ofcysl-2causedegl-9-deficient animals to become more susceptible to HCN gas. We proposed two testable hypotheses. First, we predicted that RNAi-mediated depletion ofcysl-2would diminish the resistance ofegl-9-deficient mutants to KCN in aqueous solution. Second, we hypothesized that there would be a correlation between the levels ofcysl-2mRNA and the cyanide resistance phenotypes inegl-9mutant animals. Effects ofcysl-2depletion on cyanide resistance. (a) In the presence of HCN gas,egl-9(sa307)worms treated with control RNAi (i) remain motile, butcysl-2(RNAi) (ii) suppresses this resistance phenotype (number of animals = 60 and number of independent trials = 3). (b) Average distance travelled in the microfluidic chambers. *p< 0.0001, two-way ANOVA. (c) Range and distribution of the average centroid velocities show a decrease in mean velocity forcysl-2RNAi-treatedegl-9(sa307)in 0.5mM KCN compared with control conditions (number of animals = 15 and number of independent trials = 7). Robustness of the Assay and Device Testing for Broader Applications We investigated whether these assays could be adapted for increased throughput, as this might also broaden its applicability. Higher throughput might be accomplished most readily by increasing the number of animals in each chamber or by shortening the time of assay. We determined that inserting multiple worms (up to three) inside individual microfluidic chambers did not markedly change the cyanide resistance phenotype (Fig. 9). We measured the average centroid velocities of wild-type andegl-9(sa307)worms in control and experimental conditions. Tests were conducted by using one, two, or three worms within individual microfluidic chambers. In each set of experiments, KCN caused a significant decrease in the velocity of wild-type worms in each case (Fig. 9,p< 0.0001). This indicates that the microfluidic assay is not limited to testing a single worm per chamber but can be scaled-up for multiple worms (up to three) per chamber without losing resolution. Furthermore, we noticed that the duration of the microfluidic experiment could be shortened without losing crucial information. In other words, even though our microfluidic experiments were recorded for 1000 s, the required behavioral information could be obtained from experiments recorded for the first 300 s. As an example, the percentage reduction in average centroid velocity for worms in cyanide solution was roughly maintained throughout the experimental duration of 1000 s (Fig. 3b). Our calculations show that, for wild-type worms, the percentage reduction in average centroid velocity caused by cyanide exposure was approximately 30%, whether it was measured over 300, 600, or 900 s. This threefold decrease in experimental time will be particularly useful in further improving the efficiency of the microfluidic assay. Scaling-up the microfluidic technique with multiple worms in individual chambers. (a–c) Snapshots of the microfluidic chamber housing one, two, or three worms (number of animals = 12 and number of independent trials = 3). (d) Average centroid velocities of single or multiple wild-type worms in a microfluidic chamber are plotted under control conditions and 0.5mM KCN. In each of the three cases (with one, two, or three worms), there was a significant reduction in the centroid velocity upon exposure to cyanide solution (*p< 0.0001). (e) Average centroid velocities of single or multipleegl-9(sa307)worms. The number of worms in the chamber had no significant difference on the average velocity measured in each condition (p> 0.05). Applicability of the microfluidic device. The distance covered by wild-type worms decreased as the concentration of the anthelminthic drug levamisole increased from 0µM (control) to 100µM (number of animals = 12 and number of independent trials = 3). Overactivation of HIF-1, via loss-of-function mutations inegl-9, has been shown to impactC. eleganslongevity and stress resistance (Powell-Coffman, 2010). We were particularly interested in investigating how a loss-of-function mutation inegl-9and the accompanying overactivation of HIF-1 could protectC. elegansfrom cyanide toxicity. In this article, we have presented a novel microfluidics-based approach to study the responses ofC. elegansto this toxicant. Through the HCN gas exposure assays, we confirmed that the resistance ofegl-9(sa307)strong loss-of-function worms was dependent onhif-1function, and we investigated the HCN resistance phenotypes of other mutant alleles ofegl-9. Compared with theegl-9(sa307)mutation, theia60andsa330alleles cause less severe egg-laying defects (Darbyet al., 1999;Shaoet al., 2009). Here, we report a correlation betweencysl-2mRNA expression and cyanide resistance phenotypes in theseegl-9mutants. Detailed analyses of intermediate phenotypes such as those exhibited by theegl-9(ia60)andegl-9(sa330)strains can be very informative to understanding the genetic bases of cyanide response and resistance. Real-time imaging technologies enrich phenotypic analyses by providing quantitative data on worm behavior and velocity for every second of analysis. Microfluidics offered the opportunity to quantitate the responses to aqueous toxicants with superior spatiotemporal resolution, in a single and continuous plane of focus, at the individual worm level and in a much shorter period of time. We established that the genotypes that were resistant to HCN gas were also resistant to aqueous KCN in the microfluidic device. We investigated multiple parameters, including the average velocity of the body centroid, total distance covered by the worms, behavioral raster representation of individual animals, range and distribution of mean velocities, and pausing behavior and stops. Collectively, these data provide a rich and detailed analysis of the cyanide resistance phenotypes and of the roles ofegl-9,hif-1, andcysl-2. Higher Spatiotemporal Resolution in Microfluidic Assay The need for a real-time analysis system with increased resolution is particularly acute when analyzing subtle phenotypic differences among genotypes of interest. Mutants with strong cyanide resistance phenotypes [such asegl-9(sa307)] show markedly distinct movement patterns under cyanide exposure compared with the wild-type worms. This behavior is easy to detect and score manually in gas-based assays (Fig. 2). However, differences between mutants with weaker cyanide resistance [such asegl-9(ia60)] are difficult to score manually, especially when they have a range of decreased velocities or pause for extended times. The microfluidic assay provided much higher spatiotemporal resolution, as we were able to record the x and y coordinates (Fig. 3) of each individual worm at every second of the assay time span. The average velocity of the worm populations (Fig. 3) showed that the effects of KCN were quick, and the drop in velocity was then consistent for the time span we tested. The total distance covered by the worms (Fig. 4) gave an overview of the cumulative effects of the toxicant on worm movement. Interestingly, the behavioral raster representation of individual worms showed some surprising insights into worm behavior during exposure to the toxicant. The real-time imaging and worm tracking program allow us to detect velocities as low as 7.5 µm/s and number of pauses as small as 20–50, which cannot be recorded via a manual scoring technique. Using these technologies, we discovered important features of specific strains and their responses to cyanide. Of particular interest: (1) theegl-9(sa307) hif-1(ia04)double mutant strain had lower overall velocity in control conditions compared with the wild-type strains. Our data show that this difference was largely attributable to more frequent pausing (Figs. 5and7). (2) In control conditions, theegl-9(sa330)mutant worms moved a greater distance during the course of the experiment. This was due to both higher mean velocity (Fig. 6) and less pausing (Fig. 7). (3) In both the HCN gas assays and the KCN toxicity experiments, theegl-9(ia60)strain was more affected by the toxicants, relative to theel-9(sa330)strain. As shown inFigs. 5and7, theegl-9(sa330)mutants did not pause more frequently in response to KCN, and although the mean velocity was lower in KCN (Fig. 6), the summative effects on total distance were relatively small (Fig. 4).
