Plants grown in Veggie are susceptible to abiotic factors inherent in microgravity plant cultivation such as water stress and humidity control. Without careful control and monitoring, the environmental conditions within Veggie can promote undesirable levels of microbial growth.Zinnia hybrida, a flowering plant grown in Veggie in 2015–2016 became infected with the plant opportunistic pathogenFusarium oxysporumafter failure of the ventilation system led to an increase in humidity inside the chamber [29]. The source of the fungus was not determined definitively, howeverF. oxysporumhas been isolated on surfaces on the ISS [29,30,31,32,33]. Furthermore,F. oxysporumwas among the fungal isolates identified from leaves and roots from two out of three Veggie demonstrations growing red romaine lettuce [28]. The introduction of microbes from the air, water, or human interaction onto the plant surfaces of an edible crop potentially establishes a risk to the consumer. Crew safety and health is of paramount consideration when supplying a fresh food source through Veggie crop production and the characterization of the microbial communities in Veggie furthers the assurance that these crops are appropriate and safe for human consumption. The VEG-03D, E, and F series of technology demonstrations discussed in this work are the first mixed crop use of the Veggie facility with the growth of three leafy greens, red romaine lettuce (Lactuca sativacv. ‘Outredgeous’); mizuna mustard, (Brassica rapavarjaponica); and green leaf lettuce, (Lactuca sativacv. ‘Waldmann’s Green’). Technical demonstration scheduling for VEG-03D, VEG-03E, and VEG-03F grown aboard ISS. Seeds for each crop were surface sanitized using a chlorine gas fuming method as described by Massa et al. [34]. Briefly, seeds were batch sanitized by adding 0.5 mL HCL to 30 mL bleach in a 250 mL container by placing an open Petri dish containing the seeds into the container, without submersion, and sealing. Seeds were sanitized for one hour, removed from the container and allowed to off-gas overnight. Seed germination tests were performed to verify seed viability. Sanitization was confirmed for bacteria on Trypticase Soy Agar plates (TSA) (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and mold/fungi were confirmed on Inhibitory Mold Agar (IMA) (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 24–48 h for observation of bacterial growth and up to 120 h for fungal growth. 2.2. Pillow Assembly, Layout, and Processing Veggie technical demonstrations on ISS (VEG-03D, VEG-03E, and VEG-03F) showing the pillow and plant layout for each. The ‘*’ indicates pillows returned from ISS for analysis. ‘OL’ is ‘Outredgeous’ red romaine lettuce; ‘WG’ is ‘Waldmann’s Green’ leaf lettuce; ‘Mizuna’ is mizuna mustard greens. The Veggie production system is a small plant growth chamber. Designed and built by ORBITEC (Madison, WI, US) to grow crops in space, it is equipped with LED lighting, a passive watering system and a fan to generate airflow [25,26]. The SN 002 system was launched to the ISS in 2014 aboard Space X CRS-3, while the SN 001 unit was launched aboard Orbital ATK OA-7 in 2017. A HOBO (honest observer by onset) data logger (Onset, Bourne, MA, US) was placed in the Veggie units used for VEG-03D and VEG-03E to record humidity, dew point, and temperature data (Figure S1). HOBO data were not collected from VEG-03F. On-orbit operations for VEG-03D, E, and F were similar to previous Veggie tech demo missions [28,35] with the exception of (1) 160 mL water injection for initiation; and (2) the root mat was installed without being filled with water to mitigate potential overwatering observed in previous missions. Because these growth tests were conducted by the crew autonomously using their own time, there were no ground control experiments conducted. During VEG-03D operation, a fan anomaly occurred, causing a rise in humidity to 100% for approximately 25 days inside the Veggie facility and condensation on the bellows surface (Table S1). During the growth tests, wipes containing Pro-San (Microcide, Sterling Heights, MI, USA), an organic acid-based food surface sanitizer had been used one or two times to sanitize any obvious fungal growth on the surface of pillows and/or on the threads that hold the pillows together. The crew followed the Veggie tech demo protocols to harvest samples for analyses and to sanitize the surface of fresh leaves with Pro-San wipes before consumption. Pictures were taken for the Veggie team to evaluate plant health and other potential issues, and watering dates and volumes were documented. 2.4. Surface Sample Collection Surface swab samples were collected by the crew from 8 different sites within or on the Veggie facility using self-contained sterile swabs (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), three from the interior bellows, one from the upper one-third of the bellows, one in the middle, and the third from the lower portion, three plant pillow top surfaces, one from the internal fan screen, and one from the fan outlet vent ports. After sample collection, the swabs were returned to the sterile container and stored frozen at −80 °C in the Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer on ISS (MELFI). Veggie pillow after return from ISS; (A) top and (B) bottom, (C) root and arcillite substrate sample collection, (D) frozen leaf tissue sample. Leaf and pillow samples were placed into 50 mL centrifuge tubes with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 3–4 mm sterile glass beads, weighed then shaken for 2 cycles at 5 m/s for 30 s each on the Omni BeadRuptor (OMNI, Kennesaw, GA, USA). Swabs were placed into tubes containing sterile PBS with 0.3% Tween 80 and vortexed at high speed for 30 s before plating. All samples were diluted with PBS and plated in duplicate onto TSA for bacteria and IMA for fungi. Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 48 h for TSA and 72–120 h for IMA and enumerated. Colony phenotypes were selected from each sample and isolated on the respective agars. Bacterial colonies were identified using the Biolog Micro ID System (Biolog, Hayward, CA, USA). The MicroSEQ 16S rDNA sequencing kit was also utilized to identify bacterial isolates while fungal and yeast colonies were identified using the MicroSEQ D2 LSU rDNA kit for fungi (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA). DNA was extracted from isolates using Prepman System for bacteria or the Qiagen Powerlyzer Soil Kit for fungi. All MicroSeq sequencing was completed on the ABI 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA). Bacterial and fungal DNA sequences were identified using the MicroSeq ID Software V2.0 (Bacterial Library, 2009 and Fungal Library 2011) followed by NCBI Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST). Petrifilms were also used to identify and enumerateEscherichia coli/coliform andStaphylococcus aureusfor microbial food safety screening (3M, St. Paul, MN, USA). Petrifilms were incubated at 35 °C for 24 h per manufacturer’s guidelines and any colonies positive forE. coli/coliform andS. aureuswere enumerated and re-isolated. Re-isolated colonies were identified using Biolog GEN III plates. To screen forSalmonella, 1 mL of sample extract was added to an additional volume of buffered peptone water (BPW) and incubated at 35 °C for 24 h. A 1 mL aliquot was then transferred into 5 mL of Rappaport-Vassiliadis (RV) broth or Tetrathionate broth (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA) and incubated for an additional 24 h at 35 °C. The broth cultures were then streaked onto selective media forSalmonellaand incubated at 35 °C for 24–48 h [36]. 2.7. Molecular Community Analysis Upon processing, components for all samples were placed in RNAlaterfor preservation and frozen at −20 °C until DNA isolation was completed using the Qiagen Microbial Cell DNA Isolation Kit (Qiagen, Inc., Carlsbad, CA, USA) following manufacturer’s protocol. DNA was quantified with the QUBIT 2.0 and the double stranded high sensitivity DNA assay (Invitrogen, Inc., Grand Island, NY, USA) then diluted to 0.5 ng/µL for downstream polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR was completed for each sample in triplicate with barcoded primers from the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene for bacteria and barcoded primers for the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) for fungi. Unique barcodes were assigned for both forward and reverse primers (300 nM) to multiplex samples [28,37,38]. The PCR cycling conditions in a Bio-Rad C-1000 thermocycler included enzyme activation at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, annealing at 58 °C for 1 min and 72 °C for 2 min for extension. A final 10 min extension at 72 °C concluded the PCR. PCR products were cleaned with the Min-Elute PCR Cleanup Kit to remove excess primers and dNTPs (Qiagen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and sequenced as an equimolar library spiked with 10% PhiX DNA [28]. Sequencing was completed as paired end on the Illumina MiSeq Next Generation Sequencer (NGS) [28]. FastQ sequences were identified to the genus level using the RDP/GreenGenes and SILVA (bacteria) and Unite (fungal) databases. Data from microbiological counts (log transformed) were compared using a one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test using GraphPad Prism version 8.0.0 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Alpha diversity was determined using the Shannon Diversity Index and beta diversity of community sequencing was determined with Bray–Curtis dissimilarity [39] using a one-way ANOVA (QIIME 2.0) [40]. Venn diagrams were created using Venny 2.1. [41]. 3.1. Plant Germination and Growth The overall emergence rates for mizuna and red romaine lettuce were 91.6% and 83.3%, respectively. Green leaf lettuce seeds averaged 66.6 percent germination (75% in VEG-03D vs. 62.5% in VEG-03E/F) with two stunted seedlings. After thinning, one healthy green leaf lettuce seedling failed to develop further, resulting in only two out of four pillows with healthy green leaf lettuce plants in VEG-03E and F compared to two out of two pillows with healthy green leaf lettuce plants in VEG-03D. Except for the two green leaf lettuce plants, all other plants appeared healthy. Tip burn was observed later during the grow-outs in red romaine lettuce plants. In addition, older mizuna leaves also turned yellowish with a dry edge. All these signs occurred after the 30–31-day harvest, and increased with time, especially for mizuna, indicating a possible lack of nutrients with the age of the plant. No signs of disease were found in these plants. Water usage was relatively constant with about one liter consumed per plant per 30 days (Table S1). Mizuna required a slightly higher water volume to maintain hydration and plant health compared to both lettuces. These experiments were performed by the crew in a semi-autonomous manner; the water volume was adequate for maintaining plant health, but may not have been optimal, and may have varied among the crew members who tended these plants. 3.2.

Bacterial and Fungal Counts on Surface Samples Bacterial and fungal CFU for surfaces based upon swab location for 2 Veggie facilities on ISS. Bacterial isolates from VEG-03D, E, and F cultivated on TSA. VEG-03D wick, substrate, and root are from 2 ‘Outredgeous’ red romaine (OL) lettuce, 1 mizuna (M) and 1 ‘Waldmann’s Green’ leaf lettuce (WG). Leaves include 2 M, 2 OL and 2 WG. VEG-03E wick, substrate, and root are from M and leaves include 4 M, 1 OL and 1 WG. VEG-03F wick, substrate, and root are from OL. Plants include 3 OL and 3 WG. 3.5. Cultivated Bacteria and Fungi Isolate Identification Fungal genera identified by cultivation on IMA from the three VEG-03 tech demos. Alpha and beta diversity represent the variation within and between samples. Alpha diversity of VEG-03D, E, and F, determined by the Shannon Index, ranged between 0.1 (very low) and 2.0 (Tables S2–S4). Arcillite substrate and root tissue had the highest diversity indices followed by the wick, then leaf tissue. Leaf tissue for all plant types had the lowest alpha diversity. Alpha diversity for the swabs taken for the three experiments fell between 0.8 and 1.4. The distribution as determined by the Pielou Evenness Index measurement indicated the genera present were not evenly distributed with values ranging from 0.3 for substrate to 0.1 for leaf tissue. This trend was consistent between all three experiments (Tables S2–S4). PCoA plot represents the plant leaf tissue returned from VEG-03D, E, and F on the ISS. Plant type MM is mizuna mustard, OL is ‘Outredgeous’ red romaine lettuce and WG is ‘Waldmann’s Green’ leaf lettuce. PCoA plots represent the plant and pillow components for VEG-03D, E and F tech demonstrations performed on ISS.

Percent is based upon the abundance of sequencing reads. The Veggie plant growth units deployed on the ISS have provided a platform to grow leafy greens for astronaut consumption since 2014. This series of tech demonstrations was the first time that mixed cropping was tested in Veggie, with three leafy greens. Plant growth was successful, however, there may have been an influence on growth based on plant type and position in the Veggie. It was observed in VEG 03-D that the mizuna canopy shaded the adjacent red romaine lettuce plant possibly limiting exposure to light and effecting maintenance. Germination was lower with the green leaf lettuce resulting in fewer and smaller plants. Mixed cropping could also have an impact on the transfer of plant-specific phyllosphere microbiota between crop types [14,16,20]. Bacterial counts (CFU/g) from field and hydroponic grown lettuce have been reported in the range of 4 × 104to 2 × 108and fungal counts (CFU/g) between 8 × 102and 2 × 106[43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51]. The bacterial and fungal counts on leaves of plants grown in VEG-03D, E, and F were in the range of the reported values for farm or market produce counts of similar type. However, when compared to the analysis of red romaine lettuce from previous Veggie tech demos [28], the bacterial and fungal counts per gram of red romaine lettuce leaf tissue from VEG-03D and F were higher. As with previous ISS grown leafy greens [28,51] an increase in fungal counts was observed in some of the samples with repeated harvests especially in VEG-03D. VEG-03A and VEG-03D were run in the same Veggie facility (SN 002) and during plant growth, in both cases, the humidity was higher than other grow-outs. Humidity is a factor that can influence the microbial density and community in the phyllosphere and the surface of the leaf. It has been demonstrated that higher humidity and leaf wetness increases fungal abundance on plants including fungal plant pathogens [29,52,53]. The characterization of the spatial distribution of microbiota on the Veggie facility surfaces, plant growth pillows, and multi-species plant tissues was performed to elucidate possible sources and routes of transfer of microbes around the Veggie facility and plants. Generally, surface sample microbial count data showed low counts on the interior bellows surfaces, and below detection level counts mostly in VEG-03E. After harvest, the bellows are cleaned thoroughly by the crew with disinfectant wipes, perhaps minimizing microbial proliferation. The pillow surfaces had the highest counts of all surfaces sampled and are in close proximity with the moist wicking material, the plant and any plant debris which could facilitate inoculation and growth. Bacteria and fungi were recovered from the fan screen in all cases. The genera of bacteria and fungi cultured and identified have also been identified in studies to monitor the microbial profiles of the ISS.Staphylococcus,Bacillus,Pantoea,Pseudomonas,AspergillusandPenicilliumwere all identified in an examination of ISS air filters and dust samples [54]. Several of the same genera from the previous study were isolated and identified from the ISS vacuum cleaner bag, and also includedPaenibacillus,Methylobacterium,Klebsiella, andAzospirillum[55]. In addition, studies done on the microbial communities associated with surfaces on the ISS identify many of the same genera identified from the Veggie surface samples collected in this study [30,32]. We compared bacterial genera from Avila-Herrera et al. [56] comprehensive characterization of ISS surface and crew samples with the Veggie facility surfaces and leaves characterized in the current study and found 250 genera shared between the Veggie facility surfaces and ISS samples. The leaves, Veggie surfaces and ISS samples had 47 common genera suggesting microbial transfer and colonization between these locations (Figure S2). Unlike terrestrial agriculture, a sanitized, soilless substrate is used in Veggie to support root growth. It is aseptically packed into sterile “pillows” along with controlled release fertilizer [34]. The seeds are surface sanitized before planting, removing most epiphytes from the seed surface, and the water used to hydrate the plant pillows is relatively clean water from the ISS potable water system [35,58]. Consequently, the horticultural practices employed in Veggie may limit the sources of microbiota contributing to the development of the plant microbiome. As a whole, the phytomicrobiome is shaped and recruited by the plant from its associated habitat [3,4,6,10,59]. Rhizosphere microbiomes assemble through the selection of soil microorganisms by the production of plant root exudates [60,61,62]. The Veggie soilless substrate is essentially microbe free until the introduction of water, seed germination and exposure to the ISS environment. Water and air from the ISS have been monitored by NASA for many years and two genera commonly identified from the potable water areBurkholderiaandRalstonia[58,63]. The dominant bacterial genera in Veggie samples analyzed in this study,Burkholderia, was found across plant types and Veggie facility materials in both culture and molecular assays. The genusBurkholderiacontains over 60 known species and was abundant in many of the Veggie samples, primarily in the pillow substrate, root tissue, and wicks, but in very low abundance or was absent in leaf tissue indicating the genus may have been introduced through the water source or possibly was present in the seed.Burkholderiahas been identified as a potential, beneficial plant-associated microbe, however some species are implicated in human opportunistic infections [21,64,65]Ralstonia, also found in ISS water, was identified in community sequencing across all plant type roots, wicks, and substrate. Some species ofRalstoniahave the potential to cause stress in plants or may be an opportunistic pathogen [66,67,68].Pseudomonassp., present in the top 15 genera in community sequencing in all samples but one mizuna plant and pillow from VEG-03E may be a saprophytic epi-endophyte on plant tissue [16,64,69,70,71]. It has been reported to be a potential promotor of plant growth by producing plant stimulating hormones as well as increasing disease resistance [71]. These demonstrations, D and F were completed in the same Veggie unit, SN 002, and therefore not surprising that similar microbes would be detected. Several genera were identified by sequencing in VEG-03D and F but not in E. The generaEnterobacter,Chitinophaga,Novosphingobium, andBradyrhizobiumare a few that were identified in all of the Veg-03D samples as well as some of the VEG-03F samples.Chitinophagasp., works with certain fungal species as an endosymbiont to enhance nutrient uptake and growth [66,72]. The presence ofChitinophagacould be correlated with stress conditions and environmental disturbances [66,72]. In VEG-03DMethylobacteriumwas identified in red romaine and mizuna whileJanthinobacteriumwas isolated in red romaine only. Recently it was reported that 4 strains ofMethylobacterium, one a newly characterized strain, were isolated on the ISS with the Microbial Monitoring experiments [73].Methylobacteriumare involved in nitrogen fixation, phosphate solubilization, abiotic stress tolerance, plant growth promotion, and biocontrol activity against plant pathogens [74,75] and is a methylotrophic with the ability to utilize methanol produced by plants as a carbon source [76]Janthinobacteriumis a soil bacterium with a wide range of metabolic activities, including antimicrobial properties and resistance to stressors such as UV radiation and cold temperatures providing a benefit to plants [77,78,79]. During the grow outs of VEG-03E and F, the generaNevskiaandSpirosomawere present in VEG-03E but not seen in VEG-03F. This could be due to a natural variation between mizuna and red romaine lettuce as each plant may have its own native microbiota, or it may have been introduced. These bacteria were detected in root and leaf samples from previous Veggie tech demos, VEG-01A, B and VEG-03A [28]. If the source of these bacteria is the water initially introduced into the soilless substrate and subsequently wicked to the seeds, this suggests possible mechanisms of transfer of water borne bacteria from the seed to the root or recruitment by the root from the surrounding substrate. An in-depth genomic analysis would have to be performed to elucidate possible sources of microbial transfer. Four of the fungal species identified,Aspergillusspp.,Fusarium oxysporum,Penicilliumspp.,Rhodotorulaspp. were found in all tech demos. In previous studies of Veggie-grown plants,Fusarium oxysporumwas not found on the first growth of lettuce or surfaces of Veggie from the tech demo designated VEG-01A but has since been isolated in all subsequent tech demos [28] (unpublished data). This suggests that once bacteria or fungi become established in Veggie units and the ISS environment, unless eliminated by the cleaning and maintenance protocols, they could persist as members of the facility microbiome and consequently the plant microbiome. In conclusion, characterization of the microbiome of ISS plant growth systems and crops is critical, not only for near term assurance of crop food safety, but also for the understanding and development of sustainable crop systems for space exploration missions. Sources of external contamination, i.e., irrigation water, air, and human handling can be monitored and controlled. Strategies, such as the introduction of defined beneficial microbes to enhance plant growth and prevent human and plant pathogen invaders may need to be evaluated and implemented after careful study of the impact to these unique space agricultural systems.
