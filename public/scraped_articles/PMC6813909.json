Keaveny;tonykeaveny@berkeley.edu, 5124 Etcheverry Hall, Mailstop 1740, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720-1740 Numerousex vivostudies on either cortical or cancellous bone have demonstrated that ionizing radiation degrades mechanical properties and collagen molecular structure independent of cellular activity. The demonstrated reduction in post-yield properties — ultimate strain, ultimate strength, fracture toughness, work-to-failure — of irradiated bone [10–15] has been attributed to changes in collagen molecular structure [16–18]. Though the exact mechanism dominating irradiation-induced collagen degradation is not fully known, two mechanisms have been suggested as causes for diminished mechanics [10,12–14,19–23]. First, the collagen backbone can be fragmented when the molecular bonds are cleaved directly by x- and gamma-rays, breaking the intact protein chain into smaller polypeptides. Second, collagen molecules can be non-enzymatically crosslinked when radiolysis of water molecules creates free radicals, which cause inter- and intra- molecular bonds within collagen chains. However, it remains unclear which mechanism is more causative and at what dose these mechanisms manifest. Because changes in collagen structure are associated with a number of clinical conditions, an improved biomechanical understanding of each mechanism (i.e. non-enzymatic crosslinks and fragmentation) may provide insight into applications of irradiation [22], and also aging [24] and diabetes [25–28]. Addressing these issues, we conducted anex vivoionizing radiation experiment on mouse vertebrae spanning a range of clinically-related radiation doses (i.e. radiation therapy to allograft sterilization) and conducted a suite of mechanical and biochemical assays to assess radiation-induced changes. Specifically, our objectives were to: 1) quantify the effects of radiation dose on the monotonic strength and fatigue life of murine vertebrae; and 2) determine whether the degradation in mechanical properties is dominated by the amount of non-enzymatic crosslinks or fragmented collagen. Forty-eight female, 20-week old (skeletally-mature) C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Labs, Sacramento, CA) were randomly assigned to five groups (N = 9–10 per group). Mice were euthanized prior toex vivoirradiation. All procedures were approved by the University of California Berkeley Animal Care and Use Committee. Lumbar vertebrae (L3, L4, L5, S1) were excised and gently cleaned of soft tissue, wrapped in saline-soaked gauze (Gibco PBS 1X, pH 7.4), and stored at −20°C. In preparation for mechanical testing, the vertebral bodies of the L4 and L5 levels were isolated, endplates precisely planed using a diamond microtome (Leica SP1600 Saw Microtome, Wetzlar, Germany) and posterior elements removed [29]. 2.3. Ex Vivo X-Ray Irradiation After specimen preparation,ex vivoirradiation was performed on all vertebrae. Mice were randomly assigned to one of five dose groups for x-ray irradiation: 0, 50, 1,000, 17,000, or 35,000 Gy; all vertebral levels from the same animal remained in the same radiation dose group (e.g. an animal assigned to the 50 Gy group had its L3, L4, L5, and S1 irradiated with 50 Gy). Irradiation was performed (Advanced Light Source synchrotron facility at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory) using an x-ray synchrotron micro-tomography beam line, at 21 keV and 500 mA, for a dose rate of 13.3 Gy/sec (see [30] for details on dose calculations). Specimen hydration was maintained during irradiation via saline-soaked gauze. 2.4. Quantitative micro-CT Imaging After irradiation, the L4 and L5 specimens were imaged with quantitative micro-CT (µCT 50, Scanco Medical AG, Bruttisellen, Switzerland) using a 10-µm voxel size (55 kV, 109 µA, 1000 projections per 180°, 500 ms integration time). Micro-CT images of the L4 and L5 specimens were analyzed for height (ImageJ 2.0, Java 1.6.0). The total bone volume of the vertebrae was measured on the L5 only (ImageJ 2.0, BoneJ2). After manual segmentation of the trabecular compartment, the following parameters were measured between the top and bottom surface of the L5 vertebra: trabecular bone volume fraction (Tb.BV/TV), number (Tb.N), thickness (Tb.Th), and separation (Tb.Sp) (Scanco Medical µCT Evaluation Program v6.5) [29]. The micro-CT analysis confirmed successful random sample distribution; there were no significant differences in bone quantity or microarchitecture between the groups. 2.5. Mechanical Characterization Representative plots generated from mechanical testing of the vertebral specimens. (A) For monotonic compression testing, a force-displacement curve was used to calculate stiffness (K), ultimate force (Fult), ultimate displacement (dult), and work to fracture (W; area in gray). (B) For cyclic testing, maximum apparent strain per cycle was plotted to obtain fatigue life (Nf), strain-to-failure (εf), and elastic stiffness (Kelastic), see [29] for details. 2.6. Biochemical Characterization After irradiation, two biochemical tests (N = 4 specimens for each test) were conducted to assess the two primary molecular mechanisms that are thought to alter bone mechanics: (1) the accumulation of non-enzymatic crosslinks was measured on the S1 vertebrae; (2) the fragmentation of the collagen backbone was quantified on the L3 vertebrae. To assess non-enzymatic collagen crosslinking, we quantified the relative amount of fluorescent advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) on the S1 vertebrae. AGEs, which form intra- and inter-fibrillar crosslinks along the collagen backbone through oxidation or glycation processes [26,32–34], were quantified using a fluorometric assay (protocol adapted from Sell et al. [35]). Each S1 specimen was demineralized in 0.5 M ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and hydrolyzed in 12N HCl at 120°C for 3 hours to break down peptide bonds. The hydrolysate was then resuspended in PBS (0.1X) and pipetted in triplicate onto a black-walled 96 well plate. The non-enzymatic collagen crosslink content was determined using fluorescence readings taken using a microplate reader at wavelengths of 370 nm excitation and 440 nm emission. The readings were standardized to a quinine-sulfate standard (quinine dissolved in H2SO4) and then normalized to the amount of collagen present in each sample, approximated by the amount of hydroxyproline [13,36]. The quantification of non-enzymatic collagen crosslinks was achieved via the fluorometric assay that determined the relative fluorescence due to advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) relative to the amount of collagen in the bone matrix. The relative amount of non-enzymatic collagen crosslinks (fluorescent AGEs) for each radiation group was compared to the control. We used a one-way ANOVA to test for radiation effects, followed by Dunnett’spost-hoctest (atp≤ 0.05) to compare each group against the control (0 Gy) (JMP v 14.0, SAS Institute). For those measurements that were not normally distributed (ultimate strain), a Kruskal-Wallis test was conducted instead, followed by the Steelpost-hocto compare each group against the control (JMP v 14.0, SAS Institute). In order to compare the magnitude of responses across the different measurements – vertebral strength, crosslink AGEs, and fragmentation fluorescence – each datum for the individual specimen was normalized by the mean value of that measurement for the control group. Then, the means of these normalized values for the crosslink AGEs and fragmentation fluorescence measurements were individually compared against the mean normalized value for vertebral strength, using a Student’s t-test (p≤ 0.05) (JMP v 14.0, SAS Institute). 3.1.

Biochemical Characterization Comparison of vertebral strength with two primary mechanisms of collagen degradation: (1) collagen crosslinks represented by AGEs, and (2) collagen fragmentation indicated by a lower fluorescence unit (FU) value indicating less collagen with a nominal chain length, by radiation dose. Data were normalized by the mean of their respective 0 Gy control, and shown as normalized least-square means, with error bars signifying 95% confidence intervals analyzed by ANOVA with Dunnett’s post-hoc test,p< 0.05. * representsp< 0.0001 for vertebral ultimate strength; † representsp< 0.0001 for AGEs; ‡ representsp< 0.05 for FU. 3.3. Quantitative micro-CT Imaging Ex vivoionizing radiation of whole-bones caused a reduction in compressive monotonic strength and fatigue life. Decreased strength was best explained by collagen fragmentation, not the accumulation of non-enzymatic collagen crosslinks. Non-enzymatic collagen crosslinks may play a smaller role in degrading mechanical strength of bone than previously considered. Irradiation has unique effects on cyclic behavior that are not manifested in static behavior.

Appendix: Supplemental Study To gain insight into the effect of ionizing radiation between 1,000 and 17,000 Gy, we conducted an additionalex vivox-ray radiation experiment on excised mouse lumbar vertebrae from 20-week old, female, C57BL/6J mice, randomly assigned to a one-timeex vivoradiation dose of either 0 (n = 4), 5,000 (n = 5), or 10,000 Gy (n = 5). As detailed above, we measured mechanical properties, collagen crosslinks, and collagen fragmentation (data not shown). We observed compressive fatigue life to be lower for the irradiated groups, being 18% (p< 0.01) and 37% (p< 0.0001) lower for 5,000 and 10,000 Gy doses, respectively, compared to the control (5.0 ± 0.4 log(cycles)). We detected no significant effect of radiation dose for any of the compressive monotonic mechanical properties, either for strength (p= 0.12), stiffness (p= 0.62), or maximum displacement (p= 0.51). Collagen crosslinks increased significantly for all irradiated groups, by 71% and 101% for 5,000 and 10,000 Gy, respectively (p< 0.05). Collagen fragmentation was evident for 5,000 Gy, observed as a significant decrease in the amount of nominally sized collagen chains (~150 kDa) compared to the 0 Gy control (p= 0.008); data for the 10,000 Gy group was lost due to a processing error. These findings suggest that doses well below sterilization standards (30,000 ± 5,000 Gy) and a proposed alternative (11,000 Gy) may compromise the mechanical strength and collagen integrity of bone allografts, making them more susceptible to failure under cyclic loading [4,5,59].
