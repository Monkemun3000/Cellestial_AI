  "content": "Development of a size-separation technique to isolateCaenorhabditis elegansembryos using mesh filters * E-mail:erik.andersen@gmail.com Received 2025 Jan 12; Accepted 2025 Mar 14; Collection date 2025. The free-living nematodeCaenorhabditis eleganshas been routinely used to study gene functions, genetic interactions, and conserved signaling pathways. Most experiments require that the animals are synchronized to be at the same specific developmental stage. Bleach synchronization is traditionally used to obtain a population of staged embryos, but the method can have harmful effects on the embryos. The physical separation of differently sized animals is preferred but often difficult to perform because some developmental stages are the same sizes as others. Microfluidic device filters have been used as alternatives, but they are expensive and require customization to scale up the preparation of staged animals. Here, we present a protocol for the synchronization of embryos using mesh filters. Using filtration, we obtained a higher yield of embryos per plate than using the standard bleach synchronization protocol and at a scale beyond microfluidic devices. Importantly, filtration has no deleterious effects on downstream larval development assays. In conclusion, we have exploited the differences in the sizes ofC. elegansdevelopmental stages to isolate embryo cultures suitable for use in high-throughput assays. Nematodes of the genusCaenorhabditisare an ideal system to study genes, genetic interactions, and evolutionary conserved signaling pathways. The most studied organism of this group isCaenorhabditis elegans, because of its short life cycle, hermaphroditic mating system, cost-effective cultivation, small size, transparency, small genome, and the simplicity of genetic modification and functional testing in a laboratory setting [1].C. elegansdevelop through four morphologically distinct larval stages (L1 - L4), before progressing into adults. Most experiments require the nematodes to be at a specific developmental stage because of the distinct morphologies, behaviors, and gene expression patterns of each stage. High-throughput assays such as RNA sequencing, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), drug screens, proteomics, and behavioral assays require a large number of animals at a particular stage. The standard method of obtaining nematodes at a specific developmental stage is by collecting embryos and allowing them to hatch into L1 larvae that are arrested when starved. The synchronous population of L1 larvae is fed and then incubated at the desired temperature until the animals grow to the target developmental stage. Embryos are obtained from the uterus of gravid adults by dissolving the hypodermis using a hypochlorite (bleach) solution (Fig 1). However, different parameters such as the bleaching time and temperature of the bleach solution affect the survival of the embryos [2]. To control for the variability in the numbers of viable, unaffected animals after bleach synchronization, three independent replicates are typically performed for high-throughput assays, making the process time-consuming [3–5]. Fig 1. Comparison of bleach and filtration techniques to collect embryos. Bleach synchronization involves dissolving the hypodermis of gravid adults and releasing the embryos. Filtration involves using size-specific filters to separate the embryos from the adults. The figure was created using BioRender. To overcome the limitations of bleach synchronization, microfluidic devices can sort animals based on the size differences of each developmental stage [6,7]. Such devices enable precise control of parameters such as liquid flow, pressure, and temperature enabling effective sorting [8]. However, the major drawbacks of such devices are their high cost, lack of scalability to many independent strains, and the requirement to build them, making them inaccessible to many groups. Mesh filters of different sizes are a cheaper alternative to microfluidic devices. Separation ofC. elegansstages by size has been done using filters of different mesh sizes that allow specific stages to pass through and some stages to be retained on top of the mesh (Fig 1), [9]. Filters with different pore sizes are commercially available. For example, Wilson sieves of 5 µm mesh size were used to separate L1 or L2 populations [10], plate-based nylon mesh filters of 11 µm from Millipore MultiScreen were used to purify the L1 stage [11], pluriSelect filters were used to isolate L4 and young adult stages ofC. elegans[9], mesh filters have also been used to separate males from hermaphrodites [12], and in-house filters were also constructed with 50 mL conical tubes and monofilament mesh of the required pore size to recover the L4 stage (on 20 µm filters) and day-one adults (on 50 µm filters) [13]. We used filters from pluriSelect to specifically isolate embryos that were laid on an OP50-seeded plate. Based on the widths of the different developmental stages, we conducted sequential filtration using filters of two mesh sizes, 40 µm and 20 µm. The 40 µm filter retained adults and debris. The embryos and larval stages, which are smaller in width, passed through the 40 µm mesh and were collected on the 20 µm mesh. The 20 µm mesh further allowed the smaller larval stages to pass through and the embryos to be retained. Using our technique, we recovered approximately 9,500 embryos from one 6 cm OP50-seeded plate, compared to approximately 5,000 embryos by bleach synchronization, using theC. elegansN2 laboratory-adapted strain. To further increase the embryo yield per plate, we incorporated polyethylene glycol (PEG) in the M9 buffer (3% w/v) changing the osmolarity and improving embryo pelleting by three-fold. PEG has been used previously in M9 buffers without adverse effects onC. elegans[15]. Additionally, PEG has been employed for the encapsulation of various organisms, includingC. elegans, with no harmful side effects [16]. We further showed that the embryos obtained by filtration developed into healthier larvae compared to the larvae obtained by bleach synchronization. Furthermore, we found similar or longer (indicating less of an effect) animal lengths after 48 hours of growth from the L1 stage when embryos were collected using filtration compared to bleach and exposed to albendazole, an anthelmintic compound known to inhibit animal development [17]. In summary, we have developed a protocol to obtain synchronized embryos that improves upon the traditional method of bleach synchronization. The strains used for the assays were N2, CB4856, CX11271, ECA36, JU775, and MY16. All strains were from theCaenorhabditisNatural Diversity Resource (CaeNDR) [18]. Animals were maintained at 20°C for three generations before starting any assay. Modified nematode growth medium (NGMA), which consists of 1% agar and 0.7% agarose was used to grow the strains on 6 cm plates [19].Escherichia colistrains OP50 and HB101 were used as food sources. Conical bleach (bleach synchronization) to obtain embryos Five L4-staged hermaphrodites were transferred to a 6 cm OP50-seeded plate and incubated at 21.5°C for four days. On the fourth day, the animals were washed with M9 buffer (3 g of KH2PO4, 6 g of Na2HPO4, and 5 g of NaCl in 1 L Milli-Q water), collected in a 15 mL centrifuge tube, and pelleted by centrifuging at 254 g (Eppendorf 5810R) for one minute. The supernatant was discarded and 6 mL of bleach solution (2 mL of NaOCl and 0.2 g of NaOH in 10 mL Milli-Q water) was added. The tubes were shaken vigorously for four minutes to dissolve the hypodermis. As soon as broken animal bodies were observed under the microscope, the tubes were centrifuged at 254 g (Eppendorf 5810R) for 30 seconds. The supernatant was discarded and approximately 10 mL of M9 buffer was added to the tube and centrifuged at 254 g (Eppendorf 5810R) for one minute. The supernatant was discarded and approximately 10 mL of K medium (51 mM NaCl, 32 mM KCl, 3 mM CaCl2, and 3 mM MgSO4in Milli-Q water) was added to the tube and centrifuged at 254 g (Eppendorf 5810R) for one minute. After the final wash, the embryo pellet was resuspended in 3 mL of K medium. The embryo titer was determined by counting the number of embryos in five replicates of 3 µL aliquots. Optimization of pre-filtration conditions We followed the protocol that we previously published on protocols.io. (dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.e6nvwbb29vmk/v1)with one modification. The protocol uses two 40 µm filters, and we used one 40 µm filter. Fig 2. Set up of filtration apparatus. (1)A funnel is used to pour the embryo solution.(2)40 µm mesh filter to retain adults.(3)20 µm mesh filter to retain embryos.(4)Connector ring to connect to a vacuum to allow the embryo solution to pass through.(5)A collection tube is used to collect the flow through, which consists of the majority of larvae. P0embryos were collected using the conical bleach protocol (refer to Conical bleach to obtain embryos above). After obtaining an average embryo count, the volume of resuspension solution containing 450 P0embryos was added to 6 cm OP50-seeded plates and incubated at 21.5°C for three days. After three days, the P0adults were washed from the plates by adding 2 mL M9 buffer, gently swirling the plates, and discarding the solution (Fig 3A). The step was repeated once more. The step ensured that most of the P0adults and G1larvae stuck to the OP50 bacteria were washed away (Fig 3B). The G1embryos retained on the OP50 bacteria lawn were collected by adding 2 mL M9 buffer and gently scraping off the embryos using a rubber policeman (Fig 3C). The M9 buffer containing the G1embryos was collected in a 15 mL centrifuge tube and passed through the filtration apparatus. Fig 3. Collection of embryos for filtration. (A)A 6 cm OP50-seeded plate with P0adults and G1embryos.(B)A 6 cm OP50-seeded plate after the P0adults have been washed away with M9 buffer.(C)An OP50-seeded plate after the G1embryos have been scraped off in M9 buffer with a rubber policeman. The figure was created using BioRender. The 15 mL tube containing G1embryos in M9 buffer was inverted 5–6 times to ensure that the embryos were in suspension and added to the funnel of the filtration apparatus (Figs 3Cand4). The connector ring was opened and connected to a vacuum to help the embryo solution pass through the filters. Once all the solution had passed through the filters, the filtration apparatus was disassembled by removing the funnel, connector ring, and 40 µm filter. The 40 µm filter retained the P0adults and debris, and the G1embryos and larval stages passed through the filter. The 20 µm filter retained the G1embryos and a few larvae, while most of the larvae passed through the filter. The 20 µm filter, containing most of the G1embryos and a few larvae was inverted and added on top of a clean, labeled 50 mL conical tube. The top of the 20 µm filter now faced the inside of the conical tube (Fig 4). 4 mL of 25% bleach solution (1 mL of bleach solution + 3 mL of M9 buffer) was added to the reversed side of the 20 µm filter and incubated for 30 seconds. The addition of 25% bleach killed the few G1larvae that were retained on the 20 µm filter. After 30 seconds, 6 mL of 3% PEG (PEG3350) (Millipore sigma, Catalog # P4338) in M9 buffer (3 g of PEG in 100 mL of M9 buffer) was added to the filter. After the solution had passed through the filter, the contents of the 50 mL conical tube were transferred to a clean 15 mL centrifuge tube and centrifuged at 3197 g (Eppendorf 5810R) for one minute. The supernatant was discarded and approximately 10 mL of 3% PEG in M9 buffer was added. The tube was centrifuged at 3197 g (Eppendorf 5810R) for one minute and the supernatant was discarded. The wash step was repeated once more. After the final wash, the embryos were resuspended in 3 mL of K medium. G1embryo titer was determined by counting the number of embryos in five 3 µL aliquots.

The figure was created using BioRender. Albendazole (ABZ) stock preparation Albendazole (Source: Fulka; CAS number: 54965-21-8; Catalog number: A4673-10G) was prepared at a stock concentration of 100 mM in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and aliquoted in microcentrifuge tubes in 50 µL aliquots that were stored at −20°C. The aliquots were thawed on the day of the assay and discarded after use. High-throughput phenotyping assay (HTA) One of the major challenges of conducting high-throughputC. elegansassays is collecting a large number of embryos. Traditionally, bleach synchronization has been used to harvest embryos. However, the process is time-consuming and introduces high variability [3–5]. To overcome the challenges of bleach synchronization, we demonstrated the use of commercially available mesh filters to collect a large number of embryos with high purity. We set up the filtration apparatus as shown (Fig 2). Briefly, a connector ring was attached to a 50 mL conical tube. A 20 µm filter (green color) was attached on top of the connector ring. A 40 µm filter (blue color) was added on top of the 20 µm filter. A funnel was attached to the 40 µm filter. Optimization of filtration conditions The G1offspring recovered from the 20 µM mesh filter were 94–100% (data collected from up to 50 filtrations) embryos with rare L1 larvae contaminants. To get 100% G1embryo cultures, we sought to kill the L1 larvae by exposing the recovered mixed-stage population to a bleach solution. We optimized the bleach concentration and exposure time so that it was sufficient to kill the larvae without any damaging effects on the G1embryos. We tested three different concentrations of bleach solution (10%, 20%, and 25% in M9 buffer) with varying exposure times (30, 60, 120, and 150 seconds) to identify the optimal condition that killed the larvae (identified by lack of movement) with minimal impact on embryos. Treating the recovered population with 25% bleach solution for 30 seconds killed the larvae with minimal impact on embryonic lethality as measured after 24 hours of recovery (S1 Table). For our initial experiments, we used M9 buffer as the wash solution for all subsequent washes. However, embryos might be lost during each M9 buffer wash. To reduce the potential for loss, we altered the osmolarity of the M9 buffer using PEG. We used PEG at four different concentrations (0.5%, 1%, 2%, and 3% w/v) in M9 buffer and obtained the highest yield with 3% PEG. Consequently, we used 3% PEG in M9 buffer for all subsequent washes. We recovered two times more embryos from a single 6 cm OP50-seeded plate when 3% PEG was incorporated with M9 buffer in the wash solution (average embryo yield was 12,539 ± 5,727 SD with 3% PEG in M9 buffer compared to an average embryonic yield of 6,821 ± 5,364 SD with M9 buffer) (S2A Fig). To ensure that PEG did not affect the hatching of embryos, we assessed the embryonic lethality after 24 hours. The average embryonic lethality of embryos that were washed with 3% PEG was similar to the embryonic lethality of embryos that were washed with M9 buffer (4.5% for 3% PEG in M9 buffer and 3.8% for M9), indicating that the use of PEG does not damage the embryos (S2B Fig). Filtration yields a higher number of embryos compared to bleach synchronization To determine the efficacy of embryo filtration, we collected embryos using bleach synchronization and filtration techniques in parallel. We used the same number of 6 cm OP50-seeded plates that had an equivalent number of P0adults. We recovered an average of 4,946 (SD ± 3360) G1embryos by bleach synchronization, compared to an average of 9,474 (SD ± 6764) G1embryos by filtration (Fig 5). To account for variability that might be introduced by different experimentalists performing the protocols, we employed three experimentalists to conduct the filtration and bleach protocols to collect the G1embryos. We did not find a significant difference between any two experimentalists for either of the two protocols (p= 0.217 for the bleach synchronization protocol, andp= 0.706 for the filtration protocol, Kruskall-Wallis rank-sum test). Fig 5. A higher number of G1embryos were recovered from filtration than by bleach synchronization.

The median is represented by the solid horizontal line with the 75thand 25thquartiles on the top and bottom of the box, respectively. Whiskers extend from the box to the maximum and minimum values that fall within 1.5 times the interquartile range above and below the 75thand 25thpercentiles, respectively. The three different colors of the points indicate three experimentalists. A significantly higher number of G1embryos were collected by filtration (p= 0.00064, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Eight replicates were tested by each experimentalist for each method. Embryos obtained by filtration develop comparably to the embryos obtained by bleach synchronization We aimed to understand differences in the development of G1embryos collected by bleach and filtration protocols, so we harvested embryos using bleach synchronization and filtration protocols in parallel and measured the lengths of the animals after 48 hours of growth using a liquid-based larval development assay [3,5,22,23]. We used length as an indicator of development because nematodes get longer as they proceed through development. The G1embryos obtained by filtration grew to longer animals compared to the lengths of animals that developed from G1embryos collected by bleaching (p= 0.0025; Wilcoxon test), indicating that filtration is healthier compared to bleaching (Fig 6). We conducted a Kruskall-Wallis test to assess the variance explained by the different replicates. Ap-valueof 2 × 10-16indicated a large difference in the variance between replicates. Fig 6. Embryos obtained by filtration developed comparably to the embryos obtained by bleach. The box plot shows the length of L4 animals that developed from G1embryos collected by bleach or filtration protocols. Median is represented by the solid horizontal line with the 75thand 25thquartiles on the top and bottom of the box, respectively. Whiskers extend from the box to the maximum and minimum values that fall within 1.5 times the interquartile range above and below the 75thand 25thpercentiles, respectively. Each point is the summarized measurement of an individual well containing between five and 30 animals. G1embryos collected by filtration grew into animals with longer lengths compared to lengths of animals that developed from G1embryos collected using bleach synchronization (p= 0.0025; Wilcoxon rank-sum test). The assay was carried out in three replicates independently by three experimentalists (represented by the three different colored points). G1embryos collected by filtration develop similarly to the G1embryos obtained by bleach synchronization when exposed to an anthelmintic compound Fig 7. G1embryos collected by filtration developed similarly to the G1embryos obtained by bleach synchronization when exposed to an anthelmintic compound. Bleach synchronization has been routinely used to obtain a synchronized population of embryos. However, because of the harsh chemical nature of bleach, many parameters need to be carefully controlled to ensure the maximum survival of embryos [2]. By contrast, filtration takes advantage of the size differences among developmental stages, allowing the separation of embryos with minimal exposure to chemical stress. We have demonstrated that filtration is a better alternative to bleaching to scale up preparations of stagedC. elegansembryos in terms of embryonic yield per plate and with no deleterious effects on larval development. We optimized our pre-filtration conditions based on theC. elegansreference strain N2 and obtained the highest yield of G1embryos by incubating 450 P0embryos at 21.5°C for three days [29]. However, wild strains and mutants have different egg-laying rates and brood sizes, so the number of P0embryos to start the assay might need to be adjusted for other strains. We tested two bacterial strains and found OP50 to be the stickiest to help retain the embryos. Other bacteria might be stickier and should be tested in the future. All our assays were done on 6 cm plates. Higher embryo yields can be obtained by using 10 cm or larger plates. We have applied our technique to harvest embryos fromC. elegans. However, embryos from otherCaenorhabditisspecies that have similar dimensions toC. elegans(e.g.,C. briggsae) can also be isolated. Additionally, the technique could also be adapted to isolate embryos with smaller or larger dimensions by altering the mesh sizes. In summary, our technique provides a robust way of collecting large numbers ofC. elegansembryos with high purity without the need to subject the animals to bleach.
