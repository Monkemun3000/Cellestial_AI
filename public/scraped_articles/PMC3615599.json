Received 2012 Nov 8; Accepted 2013 Jan 22; Issue date 2013 Mar 15. by the year 2030, individuals,85 years and older, will constitute the fastest-growing segment of the population in the United States (1), and aging is associated with a decline in maximal exercise capacity (23,41,55,57,59,72), which may contribute to the adoption of a more sedentary lifestyle. During the transition from rest to exercise, a rapid redistribution of peripheral blood flow is essential to maintain central venous return and the instantaneous elevation of cardiac output (30), as well as augment oxygen (O2) delivery to the active musculature to match the immediate increase (≤2 s) in O2consumption (7). However, during exercise (52), heat stress (38), and orthostatic challenges (61), whole-body hemodynamics (i.e., cardiac output distribution and perturbations in arterial pressure) are altered in old vs. young subjects. In particular, during exercise, old age-associated alterations in muscle blood flow (10,21,46,77) result in a mismatching of O2delivery to O2consumption (9,14,22), which would expectedly contribute to an age-related functional decline. Whether aging affects the distribution of blood flow to other tissues, such as adipose tissue (AT), during exercise remains to be determined. We have demonstrated recently that arterial pressure in old rats decreases during an orthostatic challenge, which was associated with an inability to elevate vascular resistance in white AT (61). Furthermore, there was a severely diminished α-adrenergic vasoconstriction in AT-resistance arteries with old age (61). Given that AT makes up a greater proportion of body composition with aging in rats (18) and humans (11), a reduced vasoconstriction of resistance vessels from this tissue could have significant ramifications on the ability to regulate AT blood flow in aged individuals to maintain arterial pressure and muscle blood flow during exercise (19). As AT receives a large proportion of cardiac output (∼8–12%) under normal resting conditions (18), old age-associated alterations in AT blood flow could have significant consequences on the ability to redirect blood flow to active tissue during physical activity in the elderly population. However, the effects of aging and exercise on AT blood flow are unknown. Therefore, the purpose of this investigation was to test the hypotheses that with old age,1) there is an inability to modulate AT blood flow during short-duration dynamic exercise, and2) the altered adipose blood flow response with old age will be associated with a diminished α-adrenergic and myogenic vasoconstriction of resistance arteries from AT. Given the ability of exercise training to enhance adrenergic vasoconstriction in muscle that is not actively recruited during exercise (43), as well as myogenic vasoconstriction (50), the second part of this study was to determine whether chronic exercise training can1) mitigate putative alterations in AT perfusion during exercise and2) improve α-adrenergic and myogenic vasoconstriction in adipose-resistance arteries. Young and old rats were assigned randomly to a sedentary (Sed) control group [young (YSed),n= 21; old (OSed),n= 13] or an exercise-trained (ET) group [young (YET),n= 19; old (OET),n= 15]. ET rats were habituated to treadmill exercise, during which each rat walked on a motor-driven treadmill at 15 m/min (0° incline), 5 min/day for 3 days. After the habituation period, the incline was raised to 15° for the duration of the training period, whereas the 15 m/min speed was maintained. During the first 5 wk of training, the time of exercise was increased by 10 min/wk, until 60-min duration was reached by the 6th wk. The ET rats continued to exercise 5 days/wk for 60 min/day for the remainder of the 10- to 12-wk training period. As discussed by Musch et al. (52), this training intensity [i.e., percent of maximal aerobic capacity (VO2max)] would correspond to ∼60–70% in young rats and ∼70–80% in old rats of their respective VO2max. Study 1: AT blood flow at rest and during exercise. Blood flow at rest and during exercise to the intra-abdominal AT was determined in YSed (n= 13), YET (n= 8), OSed (n= 7), and OET (n= 5) animals using the radionuclide-tagged microsphere technique, as described previously (16,33,44). Prior to the surgical procedure, Sed animals were familiarized with treadmill running. During the familiarization period (<2 wk), animals exercised for 10 min/day at a speed of 15 m/min at a 15° incline, two to three times/wk. At least 24 h after the last exercise bout, during the familiarization or training period, animals were anesthetized with isoflurane (2–2.5%/O2balance), and a catheter [Silastic; Dow Corning, Midland, MI; inside diameter (ID) 0.6 mm; outside diameter (OD) 1.0 mm] filled with heparinized saline solution (Elkins-Sinn, Cherry Hill, NJ; 100 U/mL) was advanced into the ascending aorta via the right carotid artery. This catheter was used for infusion of radiolabeled microspheres for tissue blood flow measurements and for monitoring mean arterial pressure. The carotid catheter was externalized dorsally and secured to the skin. A second polyurethane catheter (Braintree Scientific, Braintree, MA; ID 0.36 mm; OD 0.84 mm) was implanted in the caudal tail artery and externalized at the tail. This catheter was used to obtain a reference blood sample, which serves as an artificial organ for calculating tissue flows. All surgical procedures, beginning with the initiation and ending with the withdrawal of anesthesia, lasted ≤30 min. After the closure of incisions, the animals were given ≥4 h to recover, as previous studies (24) have demonstrated that circulatory dynamics, regional blood flow, arterial blood gases, and acid-base status are stable in the awake rat, 1–6 h after gas anesthesia. After the recovery period, the rat was placed on the treadmill, and the tail artery catheter was connected to a 1-ml plastic syringe that was connected to a Harvard Apparatus (Holliston, MA) infusion/withdrawal pump (model 907), and the carotid artery catheter was connected to a blood-pressure transducer (MLT844; ADInstruments, Colorado Springs, CO). Exercise was initiated (15 m/min) at a 0° incline to assure that all animals ran continuously during the testing period without changing gait patterns (e.g., stop and start running on the treadmill). After 4 min of total exercise time, blood withdrawal from the caudal artery (0.25 ml/min) began. The right carotid artery catheter was disconnected from the pressure transducer, and a distinct radiolabeled (46Sc,113Sn,57Co, or85Sr) microsphere (15-μm diameter; DuPont/NEN, Boston, MA) was infused (∼2.5 × 105in number) in random order into the ascending aorta and flushed with warmed saline to assure clearance of the beads. Blood withdrawal from the caudal artery continued for 45 s after microsphere infusion. After a 30-min recovery period, a second microsphere infusion was performed in conscious, standing animals following the same procedures as described above. This infusion strategy was used to minimize the pre-exercise, anticipatory response (3) and facilitates an accurate “resting” measurement. Following the microsphere infusion, animals were euthanized with sodium pentobarbital (>100 mg/kg ip). The intra-abdominal adipose pad—defined as the fat that lines the dorsal wall of the abdominal cavity, separate from the visceral organs, and lies bilaterally along the vertebral column, extending caudally from the diaphragm to the pelvis—and kidneys were removed. The radioactivity level of the tissues was then determined by a gamma-scintillation counter (Cobra II auto-gamma counter; Packard, Downers Grove, IL) set to record the peak energy activity of each isotope for 5 min. AT blood flow was calculated by the reference sample method (33,44) and expressed in ml·min−1·100−1g of tissue. To account for possible changes in perfusion, due to alterations in arterial pressure, vascular conductance was calculated (i.e., blood flow/mean arterial pressure) and expressed in ml·min−1·100−1g of tissue/mmHg. Data were only analyzed and reported for animals that displayed adequate mixing of the microspheres, as verified by a <20% difference in blood flow between the right and left kidney. Study 2: adipose microvessel vasoconstrictor responsiveness. Muscle oxidative enzyme activity. Citrate synthase, a mitochondrial enzyme and marker of muscle oxidative potential, was measured in duplicate from soleus muscle homogenates, according to the method of Srere (65). Citrate synthase activity, expressed as μmol·min−1·g−1wet weight, was measured spectrophotometrically using a SpectraMax M5 microplate (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) in 300-μl aliquots at 30°C to determine the efficacy of the training protocol. The development of spontaneous tone was expressed as the percent vasoconstriction relative to the maximal intraluminal diameter measured according to where IDmaxis the maximal passive intraluminal diameter recorded at a pressure of 75 cmH2O, and IDbis the steady-state baseline diameter. Vasoconstrictor responses to NE and PE were expressed as the percent change from baseline diameter according to where IDbis the initial diameter recorded before the addition of the vasoconstrictor, and IDssis the steady-state diameter measured after each dose of the drug. Active myogenic responses after sequential intraluminal pressure changes were normalized according to where IDssis the steady-state diameter measured after each step change in intraluminal pressure, and ID75is the diameter measured at 75 cmH2O during the passive pressure response, which reflects the maximal diameter for vessels in which active and passive pressure responses were determined. Dose-response curves were analyzed by two-way ANOVA with repeated measures to detect differences between (experimental groups) and within (concentration or pressure) factors. Post hoc analyses were performed using Duncan's multiple range test. Vascular sensitivity, the concentration of NE or PE exhibiting EC50, was determined by logarithmic curve-fitting equations. A one-way ANOVA was performed to determine the significance of differences among groups in vessel characteristics, body masses, and citrate synthase activity. All values are presented as means ± SE.P≤ 0.05 was required for significance. Body mass, mean arterial pressure, and citrate synthase activity.

Values are mean ± SE. *P< 0.05 among groups. In the sedentary group, at all pressures above zero, the active diameter was significantly larger in arteries from OSed vs. YSed (Fig. 5). Exercise training abolished age-related differences in the active myogenic response among groups (Fig. 5A). There were no differences in the passive pressure–diameter response among groups (Fig. 5B). Active (A) and passive (B) diameter responses to increasing intraluminal pressure in intra-abdominal-resistance arteries from young (n= 8) and old (n= 6) Sed and young (n= 11) and old (n= 10) Ex-trained rats. Active responses were determined in the presence of 2 mM extracellular Ca2+. Passive responses were determined in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. Values are mean ± SE. *P< 0.05 of active responses among groups. There were no differences in the passive response among groups. The overall purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that old age-related vascular dysfunction in AT would adversely affect the ability to redistribute blood flow away from AT during exercise. In support of our hypothesis, there was an increase in AT blood flow and vascular conductance during exercise in old rats, whereas there was a decrease in AT blood flow and vascular conductance in young, healthy controls (Figs. 2and3). To investigate potential mechanisms for this disparate blood flow response to AT during exercise, we measured AT-resistance artery contractile responses to α-adrenergic and myogenic stimuli, both of which were found to be diminished in the OSed vs. YSed group (Figs. 4and5). After chronic aerobic training, the directional change and magnitude of AT perfusion and vascular conductance from rest to exercise were similar between young and old groups (Figs. 1–3). Furthermore, there was a significant improvement in both intra-abdominal AT arterial α-adrenergic and myogenic vasoconstriction with old age after exercise training. It is likely that the inability to rapidly divert blood flow away from AT with old age contributes to reductions in arterial pressure during orthostatic challenges (61) and heat stress (38), as well as altered whole-body hemodynamics during physical activity (39). However, after exercise training, many of the old, age-associated alterations in AT blood flow and vasoconstrictor responses in adipose-resistance arteries were abolished. This suggests that an enhanced ability to centrally mobilize blood volume from AT after chronic training may be a contributing mechanism to the enhanced muscle blood flow during exercise (6) and the increased ability to tolerate orthostatic challenges (49) in older individuals. In the current study, we observe a robust vasoconstriction in resistance arteries from centrally located intra-abdominal AT in the young group to both NE and PE (Fig. 4,AandB, respectively), which is in contrast to some human data showing an increased AT vascular conductance to systemically elevated NE levels (40). The reasons for the disparate findings between the isolated vessel rapid contraction to NE and studies showing an increased adipose perfusion to elevated systemic NE over longer time frames (60) are unknown but may be related to tissue-specific vascular properties (peripheral vs. central) or the large elevation in arterial pressure with systemic NE infusion (40,60) concomitant with the loss of myogenic autoregulation at higher transmural pressures in AT-resistance vessels (75). The effect of exercise on AT blood flow appears to be dependent largely on the duration of exercise. In the current study, there was a reduction in blood flow (Fig. 2A) and vascular conductance (Fig. 3) when transitioning from rest to exercise in young, healthy subjects, due, in part, to an active vasoconstriction in AT. This observation is consistent with other studies that demonstrate an immediate (≤5 min) decrease in perfusion of epididymal (45) adipose depots and subcutaneous fat [(45), and see Armstrong et al. (2) for exception] during dynamic whole-body exercise. However, with longer durations of exercise, blood flow to AT increases, likely consequent to an increased delivery of free fatty acids from AT (25), suggesting that any initial vasoconstriction during exercise onset is modified later by circulating humoral or endocrine factors (25) and possibly tachyphylaxia of adrenergic receptors (66). Given that stimulation of nerves innervating white AT simultaneously enhance lipolysis rate and induce a strong vasoconstriction (54), there may be an impaired release of free fatty acids during exercise. Indeed, upon the cessation of exercise, fatty acids are suddenly “washed out” of AT, which may be related to the release of vasoconstrictor tone manifest during exercise [reviewed in Frayn et al. (26)]. Aging, exercise training, and AT function. During the transition from rest to exercise with old age, the AT blood flow response was directionally opposite (reduction in flow) in the exercise-trained vs. sedentary group (increased flow vs. rest;Figs. 1Aand2A). The AT blood flow response in old age after training suggests an enhanced vasoconstriction within the AT-resistance vasculature. Indeed, in AT-resistance arteries, there was an enhanced α-adrenergic (Fig. 4,AandB) and myogenic (Fig. 5A) vasoconstriction after training with old age. We are unaware of any other studies that have looked specifically at the effects of aging and/or exercise training on adipose-resistance artery function. However, exercise training has been shown to enhance α-adrenergic-mediated vasoconstriction within tissue that is not recruited during exercise (i.e., shows no net hyperemic response) (43), suggesting a possible systemic effect on adrenergic receptor function. There is also evidence that exercise training enhances myogenic vasoconstriction (17), which was demonstrated in the old group after training (Fig. 5A). The precise mechanisms for the altered AT-resistance artery vasoconstriction observed herein remain to be determined but likely contribute to an increased ability to mobilize free fatty acids after exercise training (13,69). In summary, α-adrenergic receptor-mediated and myogenic vasoconstriction in AT-resistance arteries are diminished with aging, which was associated with an increase in AT blood flow during exercise in the OSed group. Exercise training augmented adrenergic vasoconstriction in adipose arteries with old age, which likely contributed, in part, to the reduction in adipose blood flow during exercise relative to sedentary counterparts. An age-associated deficit in α-adrenergic vasoconstriction in AT may contribute to the impaired baroreflex buffering with old age (35,76) and result in a spatial overperfusion of AT during exercise. Whereas the possibility that a blunted adipose vasoconstriction with old age diminishes the ability to redistribute blood flow to the active muscles during exercise in humans is likely, elegant studies are required to address this issue mechanistically.
