Wyatt,wyatts@ohio.edu Received 2023 Jul 17; Accepted 2023 Nov 8; Collection date 2023. Spaceflight presents a unique environment with complex stressors, including microgravity and radiation, that can influence plant physiology at molecular levels. Combining transcriptomics and proteomics approaches, this research gives insights into the coordination of transcriptome and proteome in Arabidopsis’ molecular and physiological responses to Spaceflight environmental stress. Arabidopsis seedlings were germinated and grown in microgravity (µg) aboard the International Space Station (ISS) in NASA Biological Research in Canisters – Light Emitting Diode (BRIC LED) hardware, with the ground control established on Earth. At 10 days old, seedlings were frozen in RNA-later and returned to Earth. RNA-seq transcriptomics and TMT-labeled LC-MS/MS proteomic analysis of cellular fractionates from the plant tissues suggest the alteration of the photosynthetic machinery (PSII and PSI) in spaceflight, with the plant shifting photosystem core-regulatory proteins in an organ-specific manner to adapt to the microgravity environment. An overview of the ribosome, spliceosome, and proteasome activities in spaceflight revealed a significant abundance of transcripts and proteins involved in protease binding, nuclease activities, and mRNA binding in spaceflight, while those involved in tRNA binding, exoribonuclease activity, and RNA helicase activity were less abundant in spaceflight. CELLULOSE SYNTHASES (CESA1, CESA3, CESA5, CESA7) and CELLULOSE-LIKE PROTEINS (CSLE1, CSLG3), involved in cellulose deposition and TUBULIN COFACTOR B (TFCB) had reduced abundance in spaceflight. This contrasts with the increased expression of UDP-ARABINOPYRANOSE MUTASEs, involved in the biosynthesis of cell wall non-cellulosic polysaccharides, in spaceflight. Both transcripts and proteome suggested an altered polar auxin redistribution, lipid, and ionic intracellular transportation in spaceflight. Analyses also suggest an increased metabolic energy requirement for plants in Space than on Earth, hence, the activation of several shunt metabolic pathways. This study provides novel insights, based on integrated RNA and protein data, on how plants adapt to the spaceflight environment and it is a step further at achieving sustainable crop production in Space. Mazars et al. (2014)conducted the first true proteomics-scale study of Arabidopsis microsome-associated membrane proteins on the ISS followed byHausmann et al. (2014)study on the proteome of Arabidopsis cell cultures in parabolic flights andZhang et al. (2015)proteomic study on Arabidopsis callus aboard the Chinese SZ-8 spacecraft in spaceflight.Ferl et al. (2015)comparison of the transcriptome and protein abundances between the leaf and root of Arabidopsis in spaceflight represented the first use of a combined transcriptomics-proteomics investigative approach for whole plant spaceflight experiment, followed by a similar but more in-depth approach byKruse et al. (2020)where they revealed novel regulatory responses of Arabidopsis seedlings in spaceflight. Reports from these two multi-omics studies indicated that the true power of omics approaches becomes apparent when they are combined, providing a comprehensive view of how gene expression and protein synthesis respond to the unique conditions of spaceflight. Likewise, the reported low correlation between transcripts and proteome of Arabidopsis grown in spaceflight and spaceflight hardware (Basu et al., 2017;Kruse et al., 2017;Kruse et al., 2020) reinforced the benefits of a multi-omics approach. Studying plants’ adaptation to the spaceflight environment usually involves plants being flown to the ISS in designated hardware, whose designs and subsequent improvements are often based on the objectives of the experiment at hand (Kanapskyte et al., 2021;Nicholson et al., 2021). One such hardware is the Biological Research In Canister – Light Emitting Diode (BRIC LED). BRIC LED hardware is designed to enhance the capabilities of existing BRIC Petri Dish Fixation Units (PDFU) by the incorporation of a customizable discreet lighting system. Hence, biological organisms growing in the BRIC LED hardware are illuminated by LEDs with options of four different wavelengths (blue, red, far-red, and white) (Howard and Caron, 2016). Spaceflight experiments in the BRIC LED hardware expose plants to light cues in microgravity, hence closely simulating a natural environment where plants have to simultaneously integrate light and gravitational signaling. The incorporation of weightlessness and light signaling is expected to elicit several physiological and molecular responses which are distinct from other hardware without a light source (Stankovic, 2018), with the responses often novel and a function of cross-talks among various signaling pathways rather than an individual signal transduction pathway. Tightly regulated by complex cross-signaling pathways, the responses are usually specific to each plant organ and most times, tissues (Wolinska and Berens, 2019). Transcripts and proteomes encoding these stress response pathways are usually localized to a particular intracellular or extracellular region, further reinforcing the idea that studies on plant stress response should be focused on finer resolutions of organs, tissues, cells, and organelles. Several studies have identified that the plant root and shoot respond in an organ-specific manner to gravity (Paul et al., 2013;Vandenbrink et al., 2014;Lamers et al., 2020) and other environmental stresses (Paponov et al., 2021). Hence, resolving plant proteomic responses to the spaceflight environment on an organ-specific level is a step further in understanding stress response signaling pathways and the molecular adaptations of each plant organ to the spaceflight environment and how such adaptation mechanisms can be manipulated for improved plant production in space and on earth. Therefore, building upon these previous achievements in plant multi-omics research in spaceflight, we took a significant step forward by integrating both proteomics and transcriptomics approaches to understand the response of Arabidopsis plants to the spaceflight environment. Through increased coverage and finer spatial proteomic resolution, we assessed the effects of the earth’s low orbit spaceflight environment aboard the ISS on the shoot and root of the Arabidopsis seedlings. The seedlings were grown in the NASA BRIC LED hardware, hence we provided robust insight into the plant transcriptome landscape and organ-specific proteomic responses of Arabidopsis to the spaceflight environment, while at the same time conducting a hardware verification test for the novel BRIC LED hardware. 2.1. Plant material and spaceflight growth conditions Arabidopsis thalianaL., ecotype Columbia-0 seeds were surface sterilized with 30% (v/v) bleach, and 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20 for 2 mins, washed repeatedly with sterile water (5×) and dried on round filter paper. Approximately 30 seeds were plated on each 60mm round petri plate containing 6.7ml of 0.5× + Benomyl Murashige and Skoog (MS) growth media with Gamborg’s B5 vitamins, 0.5% (w/v) sucrose and 0.75% (w/v) phytagel, and cold stratified for 16h. Seeded plates were loaded in a horizontal orientation, with the face of the growth media parallel to the ground in the BRIC LED hardware petri dish fixation units (PDFUs). Each hardware canister holds 6 PDFUs, with each PDFU holding a 60mm petri plate. This configuration was replicated 6 times, making a total of 36 seeded 60mm plates loaded aboard ISS. All BRICs were kept in cold storage (4°C) prior to the spaceflight launch. The experiment was flown on the SpaceX CRS-13 mission launched aboard the Falcon 9 Full Thrust rocket on December 15, 2017. The dormant Arabidopsis seeds were activated with light and placed at ambient temperature aboard the ISS, with a light wavelength composition of 85% red, 15% blue, and 60 µmol m−2s−1intensity. The plants were grown for 10 days with a 4-hour/2-hour light-dark cycle, prior to actuation of the PDFUs, releasing about 6–7ml RNAlater into the petri plates for seedling fixation. The seedlings were then incubated in Invitrogen RNAlater for 12 hours after which they were frozen aboard the ISS MELFI at −80°C until returned to Earth on May 5, 2018, aboard the SpaceX CRS-14 cargo dragon. A similar experimental setup was established on the ground, for same duration, at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida in the Space Station Environmental Simulator (ISSES) chamber, USA. The samples were transported on dry ice from the dragon capsule to the receiving laboratories. Frozen plates containing both the spaceflight and ground samples were packed in dry ice and transported to Ohio University where they were stored at −80°C prior to protein extraction and processing while another group was also sent to the University of Florida, Gainesville for RNA extraction, library preparation and sequencing. 2.2. RNA extraction and sequencing For each condition (Spaceflight and Ground), four individual plants from each replicate were pooled for RNA extraction. Individual plants were first dissected into leaves, hypocotyls, and root tissues under an Olympus dissecting microscope (Olympus, Japan). The intervening hypocotyls were set aside and not processed for downstream analyses. Leaf tissues without their hypocotyl are referred to herein as shoots and are the only ones processed for RNA analysis. RNA extraction was performed using the Qiagen RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. RNA concentration was assessed using the Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, USA), and RNA quality was determined on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies Inc., USA). For all samples, the RNA integrity number (RIN) was more than 6. RNA-Sequencing Library Preparation was performed at the University of Florida Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research (ICBR) Gene Expression Core (https://biotech.ufl.edu/gene-expression-genotyping/RRID: SCR_019145). Here, 100 ng of total RNA was used for mRNA isolation using the NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module (New England Biolabs, catalog #E7490). Next, RNA library construction was done with the NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs, catalog #E7760) according to the manufacturer’s user guide. Briefly, RNA was fragmented in NEBNext First Strand Synthesis Buffer via incubation at 94°C for the desired time. This step was followed by first-strand cDNA synthesis using reverse transcriptase and random hexamer primer. Synthesis of ds-cDNA was performed using the 2nd strand master mix provided in the kit, followed by end-repair and adaptor ligation. At this point, Illumina adaptors were ligated to the sample. Finally, each library (uniquely barcoded) was enriched by 12 cycles of amplification, and purified with Agencourt AMPure beads (Beckman Coulter, catalog #A63881). The 12 barcoded libraries were sized on the Bioanalyzer and quantified with the Qubit®2.0 Fluorometer. Finally, these 20 individual libraries were pooled in equimolar concentration. The Illumina NovaSeq 6000 was used to sequence the libraries for 2 × 150 cycles. Sequencing was performed at the ICBR NextGen Sequencing (https://biotech.ufl.edu/next-gen-dna/, RRID: SCR_019152). Normalized libraries were submitted to the “Free Adapter Blocking Reagent” protocol (FAB, catalog #20024145) to minimize the presence of adaptor-dimers and index hopping rates. The library pool was diluted to 0.8 nM and sequenced on one S4 flow cell lane (2 × 150 cycles) of the Illumina NovaSeq6000. The instrument’s computer utilized the NovaSeq Control Software v1.6. Cluster and SBS consumables were v1.5. The final loading concentration of the library was 120 pM with 1% PhiX (v/v) spike-in control. One lane generated 2.5–3 billion paired-end reads (~950Gb) with an average Q30%≥92.5% and Cluster PF=85.4%. FastQ files were generated using the BCL2fastQ function in the Illumina BaseSpace portal. One NovaSeq S4, 2 × 150 cycles lane resulted in an average of 50 million demultiplexed, paired-end reads when sequencing a pool of 48 samples. 2.3. Protein extraction, sample processing and LC-MS/MS RNA read pairs for each biological replicate for the flight and ground control samples were checked for sequence quality using the FastQC, trimmed using the TrimGalore, and aligned to TAIR10 assembly using the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) (Kruse et al., 2020). Determination of gene-level read counts was accomplished using the Feature-count tool while the differential expression was determined using the negative binomial generalized linear model likelihood tests with the DESeq2 package in R. LC-MS/MS peptide data were analyzed using Proteome Discoverer 2.4 software (ThermoFisher Scientific, USA) using the Sequest HT search engine. Peptides were validated by Percolator with a 0.01 posterior error probability (PEP) threshold (Rioseras et al., 2018). The data were searched using a decoy database to set the false discovery rate to 1% (high confidence). Protein quantification was processed using the co-isolation threshold set to 50% and the average S/N to 10, and peptides were quantified using the peak intensity of the reporter ions in the MS3 spectra. The peak abundance was normalized for differences in sample loading using total peptide amount where the peptide group abundances are summed for each sample and the maximum sum across all runs is determined. The protein ratios and log2 fold changes (L2FC) were calculated from the grouped protein abundances. RNA transcripts and Proteins with adjustedp-value <0.05 were considered statistically significant while thresholds of L2FC≥1 or ≤−1 and L2FC≥0.2 or ≤−0.2 were established for the RNA and protein respectively to decide differential abundance between spaceflight and earth. 2.5. Analysis of the gene ontology enrichment Analysis of the gene ontology (GO) enrichment was performed using the ShinyGO V0.77 (based on Ensembl Release 107 with revision, archived on April 4, 2022) (Ge et al., 2020) and confirmed using the DAVID database (Sherman et al., 2022). Only differentially abundant (p<0.05) RNA and proteins with significant abundance in spaceflight (L2FC≥1 and L2FC≥0.2 respectively) or significant abundance on earth (L2FC≤−1 and L2FC≤−0.2 respectively) were analyzed for fold enrichment. The GO term filter condition was set at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.01 andp-values (ratio of total genes involved in a pathway found in the dataset to total genes in the pathway) were adjusted by the Benjamini–Hochberg (B–H) method to reduce false positives. Hence, poorly represented annotated terms and overly broad terms in the protein dataset were eliminated. Likewise, a comparison was drawn between the araPath enrichment terms (Lai et al., 2012) and STRINGdb (www.https://string-db.org/) terms in the dataset to ensure we get an accurate overview of the GO enrichment. In cases where we have similar enrichment terms, only the most informative terms, with fewer similarities and the highest enrichment value were retained. Visual representations of the resulting enrichment terms were created using the graph tools on ShinyGO and the “ggplot”, “GOsummaries” and “Heatmap” packages in RStudio (Posit team, 2023). 2.6. Confirmation of subcellular localization The subcellular locations of differentially abundant (p<0.05) RNA and proteins in spaceflight and on the ground were analyzed using the Subcellular Localization Database for Arabidopsis Proteins (SUBA4,http://suba.live, accessed May 2023). Specific protein consensus subcellular localizations were decided using the SUBAcon (Hooper et al., 2014), a consensus algorithm for unifying the subcellular localization data of the Arabidopsis proteome. The resulting subcellular localizations were plotted on a sunburst chart. 3.1. Transcriptomics and proteomics recovery in the BRIC LED experiment The differential analysis of the transcriptome expressed between spaceflight and ground control Arabidopsis samples yielded 15,505 distinctly mapped RNA transcripts, with 2,474 being statistically significant at adjustedp<0.05. Of this, 195 RNA are upregulated in spaceflight at L2FCRNA≥1, while 761 are downregulated in spaceflight at L2FCRNA≤−1 (Figure 1A). Protein extraction from the different organs (root and shoot) and across the cellular fractions (soluble and membrane) led to the quantification, in the root, of 20,923 peptides mapped to 3973 membrane proteins and 18,636 peptides mapped to 3412 soluble proteins. Similar to this, in the shoot, 20,658 peptides were mapped to 3965 membrane proteins and 20,091 peptides were mapped to 3537 soluble proteins. Only proteins with a FDR of 0.01 and a minimum of two uniquely mapped non-nested peptides (amino acid length >6 were retained. Proteins with B–H adjustedp≤0.05 were identified as statistically significant in the dataset. A total of 2187 membrane proteins and 332 soluble proteins were statistically significant in the root, while 1856 membrane proteins and 476 soluble proteins were statistically significant in the shoot. At the decision thresholds of L2FCprotein≥0.2 and L2FCprotein≤−0.2, 821 membrane proteins and 135 soluble proteins in the root were more abundant in spaceflight, whereas 1199 membrane proteins and 162 soluble proteins were less abundant in spaceflight (Figure 1A). Likewise, in the shoot, 1031 and 270 membrane and soluble proteins respectively were less abundant in spaceflight compared to ground control, while 778 membrane proteins and 172 soluble proteins were more abundant in spaceflight compared to ground control (Figure 1A). Transcriptome and proteome recovery in BRIC LED experiment.(A). Bar plots of the RNA and protein abundance distribution in spaceflight and in ground control. On the protein plots, solid-colored bars represent the membrane proteins while hashed bars represent the soluble protein. The quantity of differentially abundant RNA and proteins (p<0.05) is indicated in parentheses. RNA and proteins with L2FCRNA≥1 and L2FCprotein≥0.2 respectively were considered abundant in spaceflight while those with L2FCRNA≤−1 and L2FCprotein≤−0.2 respectively were considered less abundant in space.(B). Volcano plot of the total abundance and distribution of RNA and proteins between spaceflight and ground tissues. The negative log of the adjustedp-values was plotted on the y-axis against the normalized log2 fold change on the x-axis. Dots represent RNA and protein abundance with black dots representing non-significantly expressed proteins (p>0.05and those with L2FC not within the threshold), red dots represent less abundant RNA and proteins in spaceflight while blue dots represent proteins that were more abundant in spaceflight than on earth.(C). Venn diagram of differential protein abundance in spaceflight. Combination of differential proteins more abundant in spaceflight and less abundant in spaceflight, as distinct to each organ and as shared by both organs. Shoot UP indicates shoot proteins more abundant in spaceflight, shoot DOWN indicates shoot proteins less abundant in spaceflight, Root UP indicates root proteins more abundant in spaceflight while root DOWN indicates root proteins less abundant in spaceflight. The volcano plot (Figure 1B) of the total mapped RNA and protein across the organs and cell fractions gives a broader view of the pattern of abundance of transcriptome and proteome in spaceflight. Applying the widely accepted threshold for RNA tier II analysis, L2FCRNA≥1 or L2FCRNA≤−1, reduces false positives in interpreting the biological significance of the differentially expressed transcripts (McDermaid et al., 2019). However, this also led to the exclusion of over 61% of our total statistically significant transcripts (Figure 1B), with the possibility of the exclusion of some transcripts with biological significance. Membrane proteins were more differentially abundant (p<0.05) and highly perturbed in spaceflight compared to the soluble proteins. Membrane proteins in the root had the largest abundance and fold enrichment, followed by the membrane and soluble proteins in the shoots respectively, while soluble proteins in the root were the least quantified and least differentially abundant (Figure 1B). Proteins differentially expressed between the root and shoot. 3.2. Subcellular distribution and abundance of protein in spaceflight Subcellular localization of differentially abundant RNA and proteins in spaceflight.(A). Bar chart comparing the percentage of RNA transcripts (hashed bars) and root (dotted bars) and shoot (black bars) proteins localized in each subcellular compartment. The subcellular localizations were identified using SUBA4 and localization consensus was determined using SUBAcon.(B). GO enrichment heat map and hierarchical cluster tree of transcripts that encode extracellular matrix-targeted proteins and the proteins that are localized in the extracellular matrix. The color gradient of the heatmap indicates the significance of the genes and proteins in the enriched metabolic pathways. Labels with “Up” means upregulated in spaceflight and downregulated on Earth while labels with “Down” indicates downregulated in spaceflight and upregulated on Earth. In the root, plastid localized proteins constituted 35.5% of soluble and membrane proteins with reduced abundance in spaceflight, while they constituted 10.3% of proteins more abundant in spaceflight than on earth (Figure 2A). Enrichment analysis of root plastid localized proteins that were differentially abundant in spaceflight indicated that proteins involved in plastid movements, organization of plastid membranes, and light harvesting were less abundant in spaceflight than on earth, while those involved in valine biosynthetic pathways, reductive pentose-phosphate cycle, and the dark reaction of photosynthesis were more abundant in spaceflight. The valine biosynthetic pathway is intertwined with the isoleucine biosynthetic pathway, and they both inhibit the growth of shoots (Cao et al., 2019) and increase root formation. Notably, 154 membrane and 51 soluble extracellular localized proteins were abundant in spaceflight in the root and they are majorly involved in glycan degradation, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, and pentose-glucuronate interconversion. This is indicative of increased restructuring of the root cell wall polysaccharides in spaceflight. The distribution of protein localization in the shoot is similar to the root, with plastid localized proteins constituting 32.4% of proteins less abundant in spaceflight, while cytosolic protein constituted 33.4% of the proteins more abundant in spaceflight (Figure 2A). However, enrichment analysis of shoot plastid localized proteins indicated high enrichment of proteins involved in plastid transcription and organization, chlorophyll metabolism, and photosynthesis. Contrary to the root, 83 membrane and 63 soluble extracellular proteins were more abundant in spaceflight and they are highly enriched in pathways for cellular oxidation regulation and negative regulation of peptidase activities. Extracellular proteins less abundant in spaceflight are enriched in pathways responsible for plant defense. An interesting observation as regards the comparative subcellular localization of transcriptome and root and shoot proteome in spaceflight is that most downregulated RNA in spaceflight encode proteins targeted back to the nucleus whereas most downregulated proteins in spaceflight are plastids localized. Cytosolic proteins are most upregulated in spaceflight, whereas transcripts encoding nucleus-targeted proteins are most upregulated (Figure 2A). 3.3. Enrichment analysis of the gene ontology terms Creating a functional profile of transcriptome and proteome abundance in spaceflight elucidates various underlying biological, cellular and molecular processes affected by the harsh spaceflight environmental conditions such as microgravity, ionizing radiation and so on. Insight into the biological roles of these RNAs and proteins was acquired through enrichment analysis of the protein ontologies. A common feature in spaceflight, across the transcriptome and proteome landscapes, is the upregulation and enrichment of stress response proteins, especially those involved in response to light stimulus, radiation, oxygen, and water deprivation (Figure 3A). Enriched among the downregulated RNA and proteins are those involved in translation, amide biosynthetic process, mitochondrial and peroxisome fission (Figure 3A). A correlation plot of the expression (log2 fold change) of transcripts and the shoot and root proteins indicated very low gene expression correlation between shoot proteins and transcripts (r=−0.004) and between root proteins and transcripts (r=0.021). However, protein expression between the shoot and root is positively correlated (r=0.878) (Figure 3B). An overview of the gene ontology of the gene expression pattern between the transcripts and shoot and root proteins is represented by a heat map (Figure 3C). Gene ontology enrichment of RNA and proteins differentially expressed in spaceflight(A). Network interaction map of RNA and proteins with a similar pattern of expression in spaceflight. Upregulated transcripts with upregulated proteins are above, while downregulated transcripts with downregulated proteins are below. The node sizes indicate the number of genes enriched in that pathway while two pathways (nodes) are connected only if they share a minimum of 20% genes. GO terms enrichment analyses were conducted in ShinyGO 0.77 (GO terms were accessed in June 2023).(B). Correlation graph of the log2 fold change of shoot and root proteins with total RNA transcripts. The correlations were plotted separately with black triangles representing the correlation of the log2 fold change of proteins in the root and the log2 fold change of the plant total RNA (root vs total RNA) with a correlation coefficient,r2=0.021, and circles representing the correlation of the log2 fold change of proteins in the shoot and the log2 fold change of the plant total RNA (shoot vs total RNA) with a correlation coefficient, r2=−0.004. The plot of the correlation of the log2 fold change of shared proteins in the root and shoot (Root vs Shoot) is not shown on the graph. However, its correlation coefficient (r2=0.878) is displayed.(C). Heatmap of the GO enrichment of gene expression patterns in RNA, shoot, and root proteins. The corresponding GO terms are listed to the right of the heat map. The color gradients represent the Z-score calculated from the L2FC, with blue as downregulated and red as upregulated. Both row and column hierarchical clusters indicate the similarities of the categories. 3.4. Alterations to the photosystems transcriptome and proteome in the spaceflight environment Common in both organs and more abundant in spaceflight than on earth are PHOTOSYSTEM II PROTEIN D1 (PSBA L2FCRoot, Shoot=0.56, 1.02), a complex that absorbs PSII photoinhibition damages and facilitates the repair of photosystem II, and PPL1 (L2FCRoot, Shoot=0.61, 1.6) a member of the oxygen-evolving complex. Likewise, ATP SYNTHASE EPSILON CHAIN (ATPBE, L2FCRoot, Shoot=0.51, 0.51) was more abundant in spaceflight than on Earth in both organs (Figure 4). The Epsilon subunit of the F-ATPase unit selectively inhibits ATP hydrolysis. This leads to a reduced yield of ATP from photosynthesis. Of the proteins involved in the binding of ferredoxin within the reaction center, only PHOTOSYSTEM, I REACTION CENTER SUBUNIT II-1 (PSAD, L2FCRoot, Shoot=0.35, 1.69) was abundant in spaceflight in both organs, while the other member of the complex were less abundant in spaceflight. 3.5. Spaceflight alters ionic, molecular, and vesicular transports in both organs Several signaling molecules are delivered to target sites via translocation across different cellular membranes, with most ions moving passively through gated channels and molecules via active transports (Yang and Hinner, 2015). Hence, we decided to assess how the spaceflight environment affected the intracellular transport transcriptome and proteome landscape in Arabidopsis. The RNA transcript and different plant organ proteome had profoundly distinct distributions of upregulated and downregulated intracellular transporters in spaceflight (Figure 5). More ionic, molecular, and vesicular transport pathways were upregulated in spaceflight compared to the downregulated. Common to all the molecular fractions are RNA transcripts and proteins of auxin polar transporters. Likewise, RNA transcripts and proteins involved in the transport of reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipids, water, ions, sucrose, and vesicles were upregulated in spaceflight (Figure 5A). Spaceflight enrichment of RNA transcripts and proteins involved in cellular transport.(A). Upregulated RNA and protein in spaceflight (top), downregulated RNA and protein in spaceflight (bottom). RNA transcripts are represented by hashed bars, shoot proteins by black bars and root proteins by dotted bars.(B). Hierarchical clustering tree of enriched RNA transcripts and protein involved in auxin polar transport. The cluster tree for the upregulated auxin transporter term and downregulated auxin transporter term is bottom. Bigger dots indicate more significantp-values. The biological functional characterization was conducted in ShinyGO 0.77, with redundant and/or repeated GO-terms eliminated across the dataset. In the case of overlapping functional groups, the functionality with the highest enrichment is selected. 3.5.1. Ionic transport proteins 3.5.3. Lipid and hormone transport 3.6. Influence of spaceflight on proteins involved in cell wall synthesis, integrity and maintenance Altered gravity has been identified to have profound effects on the architecture of plant cell walls (Kordyum and Chapman, 2017). Common to both organs and more abundant in spaceflight than on Earth are Endoglucanase 20 (L2FCRoot, Shoot=0.86, 1.13), involved in the degradation of cellulose to its monomeric subunit, FASCICLIN-LIKE ARABINOGALACTAN PROTEINs (FLA 7, L2FCRoot, Shoot=1.51, 1.43, and FLA 9, L2FCRoot, Shoot=0.73, 0.53) and PLASMA MEMBRANE-ASSOCIATED CATION-BINDING PROTEINs (PCAP1, L2FCRoot, Shoot=0.49, 0.52 and PCAP2, L2FCRoot, Shoot=1.08, 1.47) which are have been implicated in microtubule destabilization and identified as possible regulators of phosphatidylinositol phosphates membrane reformations during intracellular signaling (Table 2). VILLINs (VLN2, VLN3, VLN4), proteins involved in the bundling, severing, nucleating, and capping of the actin cytoskeleton, were also more abundant in spaceflight than on Earth, in both organs (Table 2). Spaceflight alters the biogenesis of microtubules and this is achieved differently in the root and shoot. Differentially abundant proteins related to cell wall biosynthesis and maintenance. The majority of the differentially abundant cell wall-related proteins between spaceflight and Earth were specific to the root. CELLULOSE SYNTHASES (CESA1, CESA3, CESA5, CESA7) and CELLULOSE-LIKE PROTEINS (CSLE1, CSLG3), involved in cellulose deposition and TUBULIN COFACTOR B (TFCB, L2FCRoot=−0.4), whose expression reduces the number of microtubules, were root-specific and less in spaceflight (Table 2). β-tubulin dimers (TUBB2, TUBB4, TUBB8, TUBB9) were abundant in spaceflight in the root alone. β-tubulins are more exposed to phosphorylation than α-tubulin which are prone to detyrosination. Modification of tubulin is usually mediated by the tubulin cofactors. The UDP-ARABINOPYRANOSE MUTASEs (RGP1, L2FCRoot=0.22 and RGP2, L2FCRoot=0.56) involved in the biosynthesis of cell wall non-cellulosic polysaccharides were abundant in the root in spaceflight. Specific to the shoot are the polymers of α-tubulin, TUBA1 (L2FCShoot=−0.78) and TUBA5 (L2FCShoot=−0.3), which were less abundant in spaceflight compared to Earth (Table 2). 3.7. Spaceflight and the plant REDOX homeostasis Redox homeostasis in spaceflight. Heatmap of GO enrichment terms (molecular and biological) of RNA transcripts, shoot proteins, and root proteins involved in the cellular response to oxidative stress and maintenance of redox homeostasis. The color gradient represents the significance of the enrichment of the genes and proteins in the metabolic pathway indicated by the right side of the plot. 4.1. Arabidopsis adapts photosystems to the spaceflight environment to minimize impacts on photosynthesis Chen and Wang (2016)delineated another tangent by revealing that out of 38 photosystem-associated proteins that exhibited differential expression in spaceflight-grown rice seedlings, 34 were downregulated in spaceflight compared to Earth controls. While our findings and that ofVandenbrink et al. (2019)support the coherent perturbation of both the PSII and PS I as revealed by the transcriptome and proteome,Chen and Wang (2016)suggested from their fluorescent emission spectra studies that despite the changes to the PSII proteins in spaceflight, their activity under microgravity is not affected, in contrast with the PSI which had significantly reduced energy transfer rates, hence impaired photosynthetic activity. Of course,Chen and Wang (2016)study was carried out on Rice seedlings, not Arabidopsis and directly extrapolating the differential PS I and PSII findings to Arabidopsis might not be so efficient. However, a consensus is that the spaceflight environment leads to a reduction in the PS I and PSII complexes, which may be accompanied by reduced photosynthetic efficiency and consequent smaller plant tissues. The expression of the photosynthesis-associated proteins in the root might be due to the architecture of the BRIC LED hardware, which places the LEDs in close proximity to the roots, making them prone to direct hit by light. Interestingly,Paul et al. (2013)also reported the expression of several genes involved in light regulation in Arabidopsis roots in spaceflight transcriptomics experiments, even when the roots were not in close proximity to light. This phenomenon was also observed byKruse et al. (2020)in their whole seedling transcriptomics study, despite that the seedlings were grown in the total absence of light cue in spaceflight. Hence, it is suggested that when gravity is absent, plant roots rely more heavily on negative phototropism for navigation, inducing light-sensing “tools” in roots in the spaceflight environment (Paul et al., 2017). The proteome landscape of the root and shoot, however, differs significantly in spaceflight, suggesting different adaptation mechanisms to the space environment, a further confirmation ofPaul et al. (2013)transcriptomic study’s observation of organ-specificity in plant response to spaceflight.Vandenbrink et al. (2016)also proposed an interaction between plants’ gravity and light harvesting machinery at a genetic level, based on their observations of blue-light phototropic response in roots of Arabidopsis grown in microgravity. The upregulation of most of the photosystem and contrasting decreased abundance of corresponding proteins in spaceflight (Figure 4) however, suggests that major adaptive response to spaceflight environmental stimulus might be regulated at the post-transcriptional level, even though the direct effect of the stimulus is still observed at the transcriptional level. A combined translatome-proteome study approach will be useful to elucidate this phenomenon. 4.2. Intracellular trafficking and cell wall synthesis in spaceflight Plants, throughout their evolutionary history, have developed remarkable adaptations to counteract the unrelenting force of gravity (Medina et al., 2021). To withstand the gravitational force, plants have to ensure a balance between the internal turgor pressure, mediated by intracellular trafficking, and tensile resistance of both the primary and secondary cell walls. One pivotal molecular insight is the potential shift in cellulose metabolism in spaceflight, as indicated by the heightened abundance of Endoglucanase 20. Enhanced cellulose degradation might be a strategic adaptation, possibly optimizing cell wall flexibility in response to the unique stresses of a microgravity environment. This could be complemented by shifts in cellular adhesion dynamics, given the altered levels of FASCICLIN-LIKE ARABINOGALACTAN PROTEINs. The implications of these shifts could range from altered tissue integrity to modifications in intercellular communication. In a comprehensive transcriptomics meta-analysis of Arabidopsis plants cultivated in spaceflight within the BRIC Petri-dish fixation unit (PDFU) hardware,Johnson et al. (2017)highlighted potential alterations in the cell wall matrix of plants in spaceflight, as revealed by the glycomics evaluation of the BRIC-16-Cyt samples. They implied that microgravity influences the biosynthesis of xylan and pectic elements, leading to variations in the composition of the cell wall matrix. Alongside this,Johnson et al. (2017)also reported the reduced abundance of xylan and pectic epitopes in spaceflight-grown plants, which resonate with our findings, highlighting the potential changes in the biosynthesis of cell wall non-cellulosic polysaccharides in spaceflight conditions, particularly in the root.Nakashima et al. (2023)in their novel glycome profiling and immunohistochemistry of Arabidopsis in spaceflight also observed that roots from spaceflight Arabidopsis seedlings displayed a generally increased labeling intensity when targeted with xyloglucan monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) compared to ground controls. They concluded that the heightened fluorescence intensity post-labeling with xyloglucan mAbs might result from changes in polysaccharide biosynthesis and secretion due to microgravity conditions.Wakabayashi et al. (2020)in their studies on Rice seedling cell wall under spaceflight conditions indicated that microgravity reduces the 1,3:1,4-β-glucan content in rice shoot cell walls, implicating an increase in the expression of an endo-1,3:1,4-β-glucanase gene. This reduction might serve to keep the cell wall more flexible under microgravity conditions. This observation is in harmony with our data, revealing potential changes in the biosynthesis of cell wall non-cellulosic polysaccharides, in spaceflight environments. Interestingly, while these studies reported that glucan metabolism is impacted, the spaceflight environment (microgravity) seems to exert minimal influence on the metabolism of arabinoxylans. This differentiation in response indicates a level of specificity in how plants adjust their cell wall components in response to altered gravity. 4.3. Spaceflight significantly affects plant translation machinery in an organ-specific pattern 4.4. Combating oxidative stress while maintaining ROS signaling in spaceflight While this study substantiates that the BRIC LED hardware supports Arabidopsis plant growth in spaceflight, it is important to note that the BRIC hardware, unlike some newly developed advanced spaceflight hardware such as the Advance Plant Habitat (APH), is a closed system, hence no gas exchange between the plant and the external environment. This is a major limitation for the hardware, as this promotes the buildup of gases such as ethylene, oxygen and other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) (Klymchuk et al., 2003). Despite being an important hormone to plant, elevated ethylene level had been identified to cause anomalous Arabidopsis plant growth in spaceflight (Stankovic, 2018) and sterility in male wheat plants grown in spaceflight (Campbell et al., 2001). Beyond ethylene, the accumulation of oxygen and other VOCs can potentially reach toxic levels in the BRIC LED hardware. This is a substantial source of stress as indicated byBasu et al. (2017). Drawing parallels with Earth, closed environments like terrariums might encounter similar challenges with gas accumulation. However, there’s a critical difference. On Earth, natural processes and microbial interactions often intervene to balance out the system over time. But in the unique microgravity setting of space, these natural balancing acts might not function as they do here, thereby amplifying the challenges of a closed system, as we consider plants for bio-regenerative life support in long-term spaceflight missions. 4.5. Non-correlated transcriptome and proteome: indicative of post-transcriptional regulation in spaceflight? Spaceflight environmental conditions pose unique challenges to plants, leading to significant alterations in gene expression and protein synthesis. Our analysis of Arabidopsis plants grown in space reveals that the expression of RNA transcripts did not correspond to their translation to shoot and root proteins. The observed non-correlation between transcriptome and proteome data from Arabidopsis plants grown in spaceflight may indeed suggest a prevalent post-transcriptional regulation (Wang et al., 2022). Transcript-protein discordance can be attributed to multiple factors. One such factor is the differential extraction protocols and data processing for RNA and protein, which can introduce variation in the extracted quantities (Liu et al., 2016). Furthermore, due to the unique environmental stressors of spaceflight, the mechanisms to arrest translation could be compromised, resulting in skewed protein synthesis rates. Moreover, the phenomenon of alternative splicing, often upregulated under stress conditions, can result in multiple protein isoforms from a single transcript, further complicating the correlation. Another source of discordance to note is that the RNA transcriptome might be a reflection of the plant’s immediate response to stress, while the proteome represents a more stabilized, adaptive response. These unique constraints of spaceflight can thus evoke distinct reactions at plants’ transcriptome and proteome levels, leading to non-correlated outcomes. Hence, attributing the non-correlation of the transcriptome and proteome only to alternative splicing will be a bias. This study, by combining transcriptomics and proteomics, provided insight into plants’ adaptive responses to the spaceflight environment at multiple molecular levels. While we did not directly measure photosynthetic net production, our findings indicate a series of modifications to photosystems II and I aimed at adapting to the space environment, potentially decreasing the plant’s sensitivity to light intensity and enhancing its oxygen-evolving capacity. Concurrently, we observed evidence for an increased metabolic energy requirement in spaceflight, with plants seemingly engaging alternate energy generation pathways to complement photosynthetic production. Furthermore, our findings indicate significant impacts on cellular trafficking and potential compromises to cell wall integrity, suggesting an adaptation in structural support provided by actin filament cross-linking and cross-nucleation. This research not only serves as a comprehensive study of plant response in spaceflight but also holds profound implications for terrestrial agriculture, providing valuable insights for developing crop varieties resilient to environmental stressors on Earth, such as drought, extreme temperatures, and salinity. This study also contributes to the broader goal of space agriculture – a key component of long-duration space missions and off-Earth colonization. While centered around the model plant Arabidopsis, our findings could provide the foundation for developing crop varieties suitable for growth in extraterrestrial environments, supporting food production for future missions to Mars and the Moon. Thus, the findings of our research, while intrinsically fascinating, also bear practical implications for the future of both terrestrial and space agriculture. As we continue to explore the final frontier, understanding how life – in this case, plant life – adapts and thrives is crucial for the success of our extraterrestrial endeavors and the sustainable development of our agriculture on Earth.
