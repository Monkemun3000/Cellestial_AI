Mariner IV was the first successful robotic mission to Mars producing surface photos and preliminary data used to model atmospheric pressure, layer heights, and temperature (Leighton et al., 1965;Binder, 1966;Fjeldbo and Eshleman, 1968). In the half century since that first pioneering mission, orbital and surface rover missions have continued to characterize the Mars environment – generally regarded as hostile to terrestrial life as we know it. The martian surface features highly desiccating conditions as well as extremely low pressure and temperature. Moreover, lacking a substantial atmosphere and with a weak magnetosphere (Acuña et al., 2001), non-ionizing UV radiation (100–400 nm) as well as high energy solar ionizing radiation (X-rays, Gamma rays, etc.) and galactic cosmic rays (GCR) bombard the planet’s surface (Kuhn and Atreya, 1979;Simonsen et al., 1990;Saganti et al., 2004;Hellweg and Baumstark-Khan, 2007;Barlow, 2008;Catling, 2009;Hassler et al., 2014;Martínez et al., 2017). With such an extreme radiation environment, from a terrestrial standpoint, the martian surface appears to be biocidal. To ascertain where life can survive beyond Earth, experiments in the fields of space biology and astrobiology have examined the responses of terrestrial model organisms to simulated and real space conditions (Rothschild and Mancinelli, 2001;Moissl-Eichinger et al., 2016;DasSarma et al., 2020). Understanding microbial adaptations to either isolated and combined extreme environmental stressors helps (i) establish the limits of life on Earth as we know it; (ii) determine whether terrestrial life could survive on Mars; and (iii) refine the search for life in other extraterrestrial habitats (Horneck et al., 2010;Cockell et al., 2016). With the possible exception of the Viking missions, Mars has been unavailable to date for conducting controlled biological experiments; thus, extreme terrestrial analog environments have been widely used to test instrumentation and microbial survival outcomes (Marlow et al., 2008;Fairén et al., 2010;Suedfeld, 2010;West et al., 2010). Typically, martian analog environments are located on Earth’s surface in regions where aridity, temperature extremes, and elevated radiation dominate the landscape. For instance, the McMurdo Dry Valleys in continental Antarctica and high-elevation deserts in Australia and South America are frequently visited, analog destinations (Clarke and Persaud, 2004;Fletcher et al., 2012;López-Lozano et al., 2012;Heldmann et al., 2013;Musilova et al., 2015). However, high above Earth’s surface in the stratosphere (∼15–50 km), another Mars analog environment exists, presenting a unique combination of environmental insults that more closely resemble conditions on the Red Planet. In the middle stratosphere during daytime hours, the following Mars-like factors are simultaneously present: intense, full spectrum ultraviolet (UV) radiation, high energy ionizing radiation (including secondary scattering), desiccation, hypoxia, and ultralow temperatures and pressures (Clark and McCoy, 1965;Potemra and Zmuda, 1970;Vampola and Gorney, 1983;Keating et al., 1987;Clancy and Muhleman, 1993;Von Engeln et al., 1998;Seele and Hartogh, 1999;Shepherd, 2000;Lambert et al., 2007;Mertens et al., 2016;Caro et al., 2019). Taken together, these combined conditions cannot be found naturally anywhere on the surface of the Earth and would be challenging to easily reproduce in laboratory-based experiments. Reaching the middle stratosphere is relatively achievable compared to suborbital and orbital spaceflight investigations. High-altitude scientific balloons have been used for more than eight decades to study the atmosphere and atmospheric phenomena (Winckler et al., 1959;Winckler, 1960;Murcray et al., 1969;Mertens et al., 2016;Caro et al., 2019) and more recently for conducting biological exposure experiments (Stevens, 1936;Simons, 1954;Sullivan and Smith, 1960;Rainwater and Smith, 2004;Beck-Winchatz and Bramble, 2014;Coleman and Mitchell, 2014;Smith et al., 2014;Khodadad et al., 2017;Smith and Sowa, 2017;Pulschen et al., 2018). In this study, we take advantage of a large scientific balloon mission to the middle stratosphere (∼38 km altitude) for exposing microorganisms and measuring their survival and metabolic responses while monitoring ionizing radiation levels and other pertinent environmental conditions. Four microorganisms relevant to astrobiology and space biology were flown inside the Microbes in Atmosphere for Radiation, Survival, and Biological Outcomes Experiment (MARSBOx) payload. The two bacterial extremophiles,Salinisphaera shabanensisandButtiauxellasp. MASE-IM-9, were included to test the hypothesis that terrestrial microbial strains, isolated from extreme Mars-analog environments, can withstand the stress factors of a martian-like environment. The fungusAspergillus nigerand the bacteriumStaphylococcus capitissubsp.capitiswere included in this study because they are human-associated and opportunistic pathogens, and have both been previously detected on the International Space Station (ISS). Thus, they are likely to travel to Mars in crewed space missions (Novikova et al., 2006;Checinska et al., 2015;Be et al., 2017;Mora et al., 2019;Sobisch et al., 2019). Moreover, spores fromA. nigermight resist space travel on the outside of a spacecraft; therefore, understanding their survival potential in a Mars-like environment is of interest to planetary protection. Test Organisms, Media, and Sample Preparation for Flight Test microorganisms used in this study. SEM images ofAspergillus nigerspores in(A)multilayer (108spores mL–1) and(B)monolayer (107spores mL–1). Staphylococcus capitissubsp.capitisstrain K1-2-2-23 (DSM 111179) was cultivated in tryptic soy broth (TSB; BD Difco; composition: tryptone 17.0 g, soy peptone 3.0 g, glucose 2.5 g, NaCl 5.0 g, K2HPO42.5 g, per Liter) at 37°C under constant agitation at 200 rpm for 18 h. Stationary phase cells were harvested by centrifugation (4000 rpm) in 40 mL culture for 5 min. Cells were washed by removal of the supernatant, resuspension of the pellet in 40 mL phosphate buffered saline (PBS; composition: Na2HPO47.0 g, KH2PO43.0 g, NaCl 4.0 g, per Liter, pH 7.5), and centrifugation for 5 min at 4000 rpm. The washing step was repeated once and after the last centrifugation step, the pellet was resuspended in 10 mL PBS. Thirty μL of this concentrated cell suspension were pipetted onto the quartz disks and left to dry at room temperature (22°C) on the bench. The absolute number of cells per quartz disk was determined by standard plate counts on tryptic soy agar (TSA; composition: tryptone 17.0 g, soy peptone 3.0 g, glucose 2.5 g, NaCl 5.0 g, K2HPO42.5 g, agar 15 g, per Liter) to be 1.4 × 109cells per disk, resulting in a multilayer of bacterial cells. The facultative anaerobes,Salinisphaera shabanensisandButtiauxellasp. MASE-IM-9, were cultivated in liquid microoxic Marine Broth (BD Difco; composition: peptone 5.0 g, yeast extract 1.0 g ferric citrate 0.1 g, NaCl 19.45 g, MgCl25.9 g, MgSO43.24 g, CaCl21.8 g, KCl 0.55 g, NaHCO30.16 g, KBr, 0.08 g, SrCl234.0 mg, boric acid 22.0 mg, Na4SiO44.0 mg, NaF 2.4 mg, NH4NO31.6 mg, and Na2HPO48.0 mg, per Liter) and microoxic TSB, respectively, in sterile serum bottles with headspace pressure and gas composition of ∼1,010 mbar and N2/CO2(80/20 v/v), respectively. Cell concentration was determined via cell counting in a Thoma counting chamber. Stationary phase cells from an overnight culture of each strain were harvested by centrifugation (14,500g) of 1 mL culture for 15 min. To assess possible differences in survival between cells dried in medium (UV absorption of medium components) or dried in non-absorbing buffer, after the centrifugation step either (i) 950 μL of the supernatant were removed, cells were resuspended in the remaining growth media, and 50 μL were applied on each quartz disk; or (ii) cells were washed with 1 mL PBS (forS. shabanensisthe NaCl content was adjusted to 10%), again centrifuged for 15 min at 14,100g, the supernatant (950 μL) was removed, and 50 μL were applied on each quartz disk. The desiccation process was conducted under oxic conditions on the bench. The absolute number of cells per quartz disk was determined by standard plate counts on Marine agar/TSA to be ∼108cells per disk for both strains. MARSBOx payload labeled model. Trex-Box sample preparation. Dimensions of the Trex-Box are 13.5 cm × 13.5 cm × 5.0 cm. The container is a gastight closable stainless-steel box with one borehole which allows an exchange of internal atmosphere.(A)Quartz disks harboring the microbial samples being placed onto the Trex-Box;(B)covering the Trex-Box with a suprasil glass that allows for full UV-VIS exposure;(C)screws were used to tighten and seal the container;(D)Earth’s atmosphere being replaced with Mars-gas mixture. Balloon flight(A)Image from atop the MARSBOx payload and Trex-Box in the stratosphere during the flight.(B)Balloon flight path; stars mark opening and closing of the Trex-Box lid, which corresponds to UV-VIS radiation exposure beginning and ending. Other major payload components included three pressure sensors (MS5803, MEAS Switzerland; AMS5812, Analog Microelectronics; and BMP085, Bosch Sensortec), four temperature sensors, and a 9-axis Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). While not flown on this mission, MARSBOx can carry additional instruments (e.g., UV radiometers) located behind the front panel of the payload. For the LDB #697NT flight, power was provided by a 14.8v 25.2 Ah lithium-ion polymer battery (CU-J141, BatterySpace) fastened in place with an ultem 3-D printed battery holder. The MARSBOx payload can also utilize a direct connection to the balloon gondola power source with an acceptable input range of 9V – 36V. Stratospheric Flight Experiment Overview of experimental design. The total UV dose [J m–2] that the samples were exposed to during the MARSBOx mission was calculated as follows: where UV fluence [mW cm–2] values for UVA-UVB (280–400 nm) in the middle stratosphere were taken from a previous flight = 6 mW cm–2(Caro et al., 2019), and sample exposure time [in seconds] = 19140 s. Samples were exposed to an estimated total of 1148 kJ m–2of UVA-UVB radiation. Previously modeled UVC (206–280 nm) values byCaro et al. (2019)ranged from about 0.1–1 μW cm−2for the altitude flown during the MARSBOx mission (∼38 km). Ionizing Radiation Dosimetry: M-42 In order to determine the ionizing radiation environment during the flight, a miniaturized, low-power consumption radiation detector system (M-42) was included onboard the MARSBOx payload. The M-42 instrument (size: 142 mm × 38 mm × 13 mm) was developed at DLR and can actively measure the absorbed dose using a silicon detector diode (Berger et al., 2019). Two batteries allow the M-42 to operate as a stand-alone radiation detector system, but for the MARSBOx flight the instrument was externally powered through the in-built micro-USB connector. Upon launch of the balloon, power was provided and the M-42 started taking measurements. Data were stored every 5 min on a non-volatile flash memory and upon landing the instrument was switched off. The M-42 dosimeter was turned on at 1405 UTC when the payload was at 3.07 km and remained on until 2119 UTC at 1.75 km above the balloon landing site. Personnel from CSBF recovered the payload on 24 September 2019 and transported it back to the launch site facility inside a climate-controlled vehicle before shipping to NASA KSC at ambient conditions. Three weeks later, samples and instruments (Trex-Box and M-42) were removed from the MARSBOx payload and shipped to the DLR for post-flight analysis. After shipment arrival of the samples at the DLR, the Trex-Box was opened within an anaerobic chamber (COY Laboratory products) to ensure a constant low relative humidity (<13% relative humidity). The quartz disks harboring dried cells and spores were retrieved from the carrier and placed inside 2 mL Eppendorf tubes with 1 mL PBS respectively. ForA. nigerspore recovery 2 mm glass beads were added. The tubes were vortexed for 30 s to separate the cells from the disk, and the resulting suspension was used for downstream analyses. Determination of Microbial Survival via Standard Plate Counting The post-flight survival of the tested microorganisms was determined by standard plate counting, where serial dilutions (1:10) were plated on nutrient agar. For bacteria, TSA medium/marine medium was used; forA. nigerminimal medium supplemented with 0.05% Triton-X was used. Agar plates were incubated for 1–3 days at 37°C for bacteria and 30°C for fungi. Colony forming units (CFU) were counted, and the colony forming units per mL (CFU mL–1) were calculated. The survival fraction was calculated as N/N0, in which N is the CFU mL–1after sample retrieval and N0is the initial cell concentration on the quartz disk. Determination of CFU mL–1included at least three biological replicates per tested strain (n≥ 3). Determination of Metabolic Activity via Resazurin Reduction Determination ofA. nigerSpore Germination To determine the post-flight germination ofA. nigerspores, spore suspensions (106spores mL–1) from each tested condition were drop plated (3 μL), in triplicate, on MM agar supplemented with 0.003% yeast extract. Plates were incubated at 22°C for 18–27 h. After incubation, light microscopy was used to quantify the number of germinated (G) and non-germinated (NG) spores. At least 200 spores were counted per replicate. Germination was calculated as the average of the G/NG ratio of each replicate per tested condition. Evaluation of Spore Cell Wall Integrity To test spore cell wall integrity after exposure to Mars-like environmental stress, CFUs were quantified forA. nigergrown in the presence of an antifungal compound that acts on the cell wall (caspofungin) and a cell wall stressor (calcofluor white). Spore suspensions from the three exposure conditions (desiccated lab control, UV shielded bottom layer, and UV exposed top layer) and fresh spores (as non-desiccated control) were serially diluted in a 96-well plate. For each dilution (10–1to 10–5), 5 μL were spotted on MM nutrient agar supplemented with 0.75 μg mL–1caspofungin diacetate (Sigma) or 40 μg mL–1calcofluor white (Sigma), and incubated for 2–4 days at 30°C. Middle Stratosphere as a Mars Analog Environment Environmental conditions aboard balloon flight compared to martian conditions. aFluence rates for stratospheric UVA-UVB were measured in a previous balloon flight (Caro et al., 2019). cMars gas in Trex-Box was ordered from Boggs Gases, Inc.

Relevance to Space Biology and Astrobiology In this study, bacterial and fungal strains were exposed to Mars-like environmental conditions onboard the MARSBOx payload during a 7 h balloon flight to the middle stratosphere (∼38 km). The tested microorganisms (Aspergillus niger,Staphylococcus capitissubsp.capitis, Salinisphaera shabanensis, andButtiauxellasp. MASE-IM-9) were chosen based on astrobiology and space biology relevance. Moreover, the choice of these strains was to provide a representative set of samples that are capable of demonstrating the MARSBOx experimental design as a valuable martian analog for future investigations. To test the hypothesis that isolates from extreme Mars-analog environments on Earth would be able to survive the MARSBOx simulated martian conditions, two extremophilic bacteria were included. The bacteriumS. shabanensisis a halophile isolated from the brine–seawater interface of the Shaban Deep at a depth of 1.3 km where the maximal salinity reaches 26% (Eder et al., 2002). Deep-sea brine pools have been identified as martian analogs in regards to the salinity and water activity in brines (Antunes, 2020). On the surface of Mars, brines might remain liquid at ultra-low temperatures (Toner and Catling, 2016). In addition to high salinity, the martian surface lacks oxygen and nutrients. For these reasons, the Gram-(-) bacterium,Buttiauxellasp. MASE-IM-9, isolated from an anoxic, nutrient-limited, and sulphidic martian analog spring in Germany (Cockell et al., 2018), was also included in our study. An emerging body of evidence shows that spores from the fungusA. nigercan withstand harsh conditions (e.g., radiation, heat, low water activity, etc.) (Singaravelan et al., 2008;Esbelin et al., 2013;Segers et al., 2018;Cortesão et al., 2020a), probably due to the roles of pigmentation, cell wall structure, and metabolic suppression, which might enable them to survive space travel on the outer surfaces of a spacecraft, and to thrive within the spacecraft’s controlled habitat. Alarmingly, the inhalation ofA. nigerspores may cause respiratory diseases, especially when in closed indoor habitats such as the ISS, which facilitate spore dispersal (Silverman et al., 1967;Latge, 1999;Esbelin et al., 2013;Cortesão et al., 2020a,b). This motivates further study on how the species responds to spaceflight conditions, and consequent implications for astronaut health, in particular in long-term space missions. Moreover, on Earth,A. nigeris used in biotechnology to produce a wide-range of useful compounds including citric acid, antibiotics, and enzymes (Meyer et al., 2011;Cairns et al., 2018). Consequently,A. nigercould play an important role in human space exploration as long-duration, far-reaching, missions may require biomanufacturing and resource-independence from Earth (Silverman et al., 1967;Latge, 1999;Esbelin et al., 2013;Cortesão et al., 2020a,b). Finally,S. capitisis a Gram-(+) bacterium commonly associated as a commensal species on human skin (Byrd et al., 2018). However,S. capitisalso has the ability to cause infections in neonates and form biofilms on implants (de Silva et al., 2002;Cui et al., 2013). TheStaphylococcus capitissubsp.capitisstrain K1-2-2-23 (DSM 111179) used in this study was isolated aboard the ISS within an indoor exposure experiment (Sobisch et al., 2019). Its occurrence in crewed space stations, the clinical relevance and the phylogenetic proximity to other clinically relevant staphylococcal species makeS. capitisa useful model organism to study the effects of space conditions on opportunistic human pathogens, and to identify potential risks of crew infection (Xiao et al., 2019). Radiation Levels in the Middle Stratosphere Bacterial Desiccation Tolerance in Mars-Like Conditions A. nigerSpores Survive Mars-Like Conditions While bacterial cells were sensitive to UV exposure in the middle stratosphere, in addition to long-term desiccation,A. nigerspores were highly resistant to all tested conditions. Laboratory controls demonstratedA. nigerspore endurance to 5-month desiccation, when air-dried and kept at room temperature (22°C) at the bench, under Earth atmospheric conditions. Spores ofA. nigershielded from UV (bottom layer) endured a 5-month desiccation within Mars-like atmosphere and pressure, with additional exposure to extreme temperature fluctuations during the balloon flight (−51°C to +21°C). Finally, spores ofA. nigerexposed to UV (top layer) withstood over 5 h of full simulation of Mars environmental conditions, i.e., exposed to Mars gas, atmosphere, temperature fluctuation, and to a total estimated UVA-UVB dose of 1148 kJ m–2during the balloon flight. A previous study testingA. nigerspore survival to desiccation and solar radiation was done in an experimental setting similar to this study:A. nigerspore monolayers were dried in glass disks and exposed to ∼16 kJ m–2of UVB (280–320 nm); the specimens were highly resistant, with 24% ± 5% survival (Dose et al., 2001). The extraordinarily high level of resistance ofA. nigerspores to UVC radiation (LD90value of 1038 J m–2) has been previously reported byCortesão et al. (2020a). Another balloon-flown study (i.e., same launch site and season; different year) with pigmented spores of the fungusFuligo specticashowed that these remained viable after a 9 h exposure to conditions in the stratosphere (Díez et al., 2020). In theAspergillusgenus, secondary metabolites e.g., DHN-melanin (a pigment) and fumiquinazoline might be associated with UV protection roles (Blachowicz et al., 2020). Moreover, inA. nigerspores, the cell wall is a highly complex structure that plays an important role in protecting the spores from extracellular environmental stress. The spore cell wall is composed mainly of polysaccharides (α-glucans β-glucans), galactomannan, and chitin; and is surrounded by a rodlet layer with hydrophobic surface proteins, and a melanin layer. When germinating into vegetative cells (hyphae), the spore cell wall is remodeled and no longer provides protection to extreme conditions (Latgé et al., 2017). Considering environmental changes typically act first on the cell wall, we evaluated how Mars-like conditions might alterA. nigerspore cell wall integrity. All tested spores were able to revive (i.e., germinate) and grow in media supplemented with cell wall stressors: calcofluor white or caspofungin. Calcofluor white is a non-specific fluorochrom that can bind to 1,3- and 1,4-β polysaccharides on chitin and cellulose, inhibiting chitin microfibril assembly and cell wall integrity (Fiedler et al., 2014). To date, a variety of terrestrial analogs and simulation chambers have been used to predict outcomes for microbial exposure to Mars-like conditions. Most often, such investigations use elevated radiation and desiccation paired with low pressure and temperature alongside a Mars gas mixture (Jensen et al., 2008;Schuerger et al., 2008;Motamedi et al., 2015). However, few studies can simultaneously recreate a multi-factor Mars environment. The renewed focus on Mars robotic and human exploration e.g., Mars 2020, Mars Sample Return (NASA, 2020) and ExoMars 2022 (ESA, 2020) amplifies the need for additional Mars analog studies in the coming years. In this study we: reported the use of a new scientific payload (MARSBOx) for stratospheric balloon missions allowing access to a wide-ranging Mars analog environment with natural ionizing and non-ionizing radiation; demonstrated a successful experimental set-up, of the Trex-Box and MARSBOx combined, where four different microorganisms could be tested, in dried conditions, throughout a 5-month period, without cross-contaminations. showed that the extremophilic bacteriumS. shabanensisand the human skin-associated bacteriumS. capitissubsp.capitissurvived the UV-shielded Mars-like environment during the balloon flight, suggesting that bioburden embedded deep inside of spacecraft sent to Mars might remain viable for longer periods of time; revealed that highly pigmented spores from the fungusA. nigerwould survive, in a Mars-like middle stratosphere environment for > 5 h of UV exposure, even as a spore monolayer (106spores mL−1), i.e., with no self-shielding.
