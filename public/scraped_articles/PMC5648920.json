Antibiotic resistance in space. One often-quoted consequence of the space flight stress response of microbes is an increased resistance to antibiotics (reviewed in reference9). Early studies of microbial antibiotic resistance in microgravity focused mainly on transient physiologic changes leading to increased or decreased antibiotic susceptibility (6,7,9,10). An increase in microbial antibiotic resistance in the microgravity environment was concluded from experiments performed onSalyut 7(10) and the space shuttlesChallenger(6) andDiscovery(7). In these experiments, the increased antibiotic resistance observed in space was apparently a physiologic, not a heritable genetic, response that was reversible upon return of the microbial cultures to normal gravity (11). However, a recent careful review of the literature regarding antibiotic resistance in space led Taylor to conclude that “the anomalies generated by this confusing body of work can only be completely resolved by further in-flight experimentation undertaken in systematic fashion” (3). In contrast, space flight has been documented to cause genetic alterations (i.e., mutations) leading to antibiotic resistance. In experiments performed on space stationMirand the International Space Station (ISS), it was observed that both the frequency and the spectrum of mutations conferring resistance to the antibiotics streptomycin inEscherichia coli(12) and rifampin inStaphylococcus epidermidis(13) were clearly altered. Experiments on the ISS have demonstrated that horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance plasmids can occur among both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (14). Furthermore, an exchange of microflora has been reported among cosmonauts in ground-based confinement scenarios, among Apollo astronauts, and among Shuttle and ISS crews (reviewed in reference9). Taken together, these observations may lead to a scenario in which opportunistic pathogens could gain antibiotic resistance, establish residence inside the habitat or in astronauts, and disseminate through the astronaut population. To test the notion that antibiotic resistance becomes enhanced during space flight, we chose to measure the resistance of space- versus Earth-grown bacterial cells to a large battery of antibiotics belonging to several classes with differing modes of action. For this study, we chose to use the Gram-positive bacteriumBacillus subtilis, which possesses several advantages as a model organism: (i) it is susceptible to a wide range of antibiotics, (ii) it is easily cultivated and amenable to genetic manipulation, (iii) it forms dormant spores, making it an easy system to prepare for space flight, (iv) it is the best-studied Gram-positive bacterium, and (v) the development of its genetics, genomics, and molecular biology is highly advanced. The advantage of using the well-developedB. subtilissystem is that any potential effect of space flight can readily be investigated in further detail. We therefore describe here the phenotypic profiling ofB. subtilisin response to 72 different antibiotics and growth inhibitors after growth on the ISS compared to that of matched ground controls.

We feel obliged to discuss alternative factors that might affect the above conclusion. First, the choice of growth media, culture conditions, test organisms, and space flight hardware can account for differing responses to the space flight environment (reviewed in reference3). Second, the experimental design we used might deemphasize differences between FL and GC samples. Despite the different environments in which FL and GC samples were grown, the actual antibiotic resistance assays were performed under Earth-bound laboratory conditions. It is possible that during the 24-hour duration of the assays, FL samples might have readapted physiologically to 1×g, thus minimizing differences with the GC samples. While it is difficult to control for this factor, we note a previous space flight experiment in whichSalmonella entericaserovar Typhimurium cells were grown in FL and GC, and FL samples were shown to be more virulent in BALB/c mice on Earth after space flight (28). To gain a more accurate understanding of the response of microbial cells to antibiotics in space, it would be ideal to design experiments for the high-throughput screening of antibiotics directly in the space flight environment. A preliminary step has already been taken in this direction. For example, the resistance ofSaccharomyces cerevisiaeyeast to the antifungal agent voriconazole was shown to differ in FL versus GC samples using the free-flying PharmaSat nanosatellite (8); such a design could readily be adapted for high-throughput in-flight antibiotic screening either by a free-flying nanosatellite or by a small semiautonomous payload sent to the ISS. As a final note, aside from their clinical significance, antibiotics have long been used to probe basic biological processes at the molecular level (such as replication, transcription, translation, membrane and cell wall biogenesis, etc.). From this perspective, it is interesting to note that among the 9 antibiotics flagged by PM screening as showing different sensitivities in FL versus GC samples, 3 belonged to the quinolone/fluoroquinolone class of compounds (lomefloxacin, enoxacin, and nalidixic acid). These compounds inhibit DNA gyrases, which are type II DNA topoisomerases that function to (i) condense DNA in the cell, (ii) maintain DNA under the optimal supercoiled state for gene expression, and (iii) decatenate DNA during chromosome partitioning (29); all three functions of DNA gyrases are essential for cell viability, and moreover, are sensitive to environmental changes. From the above observations, it is attractive to speculate that the growth of cells in the space flight environment may lead to alterations in DNA supercoiling, hence, in global gene expression (30). This notion could be tested directly by measuring the superhelicity of DNA in FL versus GC cells ofB. subtilisin a manner similar to that previously described (31). Bacterial strain, medium, and growth conditions. The bacterium used wasB. subtilisstrain 168 from our laboratory stock collection. The medium used throughout for routine cultivation and plating was Trypticase soy-yeast extract (TSY) medium consisting of (g/liter): tryptone, 15; soytone, 5; NaCl, 5; yeast extract, 3; K2HPO4, 2.5; glucose, 2.5; final pH 7. For semisolid plates, agar was added at 15.0 g/liter. For the cultivation of space flight and ground control cells in space flight hardware, TSY medium containing 10% (vol/vol) glycerol was prepared by mixing equal volumes of sterile double-strength TSY and sterile 20% (vol/vol) glycerol. This medium was used because it supports cell growth to a high density and was used in a prior space flight experiment (13). Spores of strain 168 were prepared and purified as described previously (32) and were stored at 4°C in deionized water. An examination by phase-contrast microscopy confirmed that the spore preparation was devoid of vegetative cells and contained >99% phase-bright spores. The spore suspension was heat activated (65°C for 20 min) before use. From a working suspension (108/ml) of spores in water, aliquots of 0.1 ml (∼107CFU) were applied to the bottoms of sterile 60-mm-diameter petri dishes (Falcon catalog no. 1007; Fisher Scientific) and air dried for 48 to 72 h at room temperature protected from light prior to placement in space flight hardware. Samples were integrated into biological research in canisters-dual chamber (BRIC-DC) space flight hardware, which has been described in detail previously (33–35). BRIC canisters hold six 60-mm-diameter petri dish bottoms in small subcompartments called petri dish fixation units (PDFUs). Each PDFU allows for the injection of medium, referred to as actuation, to initiate bacterial growth. For flight (FL) experiments, 2 BRIC canisters were used, each containing five PDFUs and one HOBO temperature data logger (Onset, Inc., Cape Cod MA). Postflight asynchronous ground control (GC) experiments were conducted using the same hardware and configuration as in the FL experiment. Each PDFU was loaded with a petri dish containing air-dried spores, and 17 ml of sterile TSY plus 10% glycerol medium was loaded into a separate reservoir. To prevent contamination, all reagents and equipment used were sterilized in an autoclave prior to use, and PDFUs were assembled using an aseptic technique within a biosafety level 2 (BSL2)-rated biological safety cabinet.

(B) Temperature data recorded at 10-min intervals from BRIC-21 FL (circles) and GC (triangles) samples. Actuation time is denoted by the upward arrow, and the termination of experiment by moving to the −80°C freezer is denoted by the downward arrow. Note that the data are offset by 2°C in order to display both curves. Postflight asynchronous ground control (GC) experiment samples were prepared and treated using the same BRIC-PDFU hardware, configuration, schedule, and temperature profile as in the FL experiment. BRIC-PDFU hardware was incubated in the ISS environmental simulation (ISSES) chamber at KSC, which was programmed to play back the ISS temperature profile recorded by the HOBO data loggers during the flight (Fig. 5B). The average temperature recorded in the GC experiment was 22.8 ± 0.21°C. After 25 h of incubation, the samples were transferred to a −80°C freezer. Antibiotic resistance profiling using phenotype microarray. The determination of antibiotic resistance patterns among FL and GC samples was performed using the Omnilog phenotype microarray (PM) system (Biolog, Inc., Hayward, CA) using the manufacturer's recommend plates, reagents, and protocols. Frozen FL and GC cultures were partially thawed at room temperature, and then the partially frozen cell slurries were transferred into sterile 15-ml conical centrifuge tubes and placed immediately on ice to complete the thawing. The culture volumes recovered were recorded for later calculations. Each culture was mixed thoroughly by vortexing, and an aliquot was removed for viable cell count determination. Cells were recovered by centrifugation (7,000 ×gfor 20 min at 0°C) in a benchtop centrifuge, and cell pellets were immediately suspended by vortex mixing in 5 ml of inoculating fluid (IF) IF-10b (Biolog, Hayward, CA). Cells were then diluted with fresh IF-10b until the suspension reached an optical density at 660 nm (OD660) of 0.08 in a UV-visible (UV-Vis) spectrophotometer (Shimadzu model UV 1800). From a prior calibration curve, we determined that this OD660in a standard 1-cm-path-length cuvette corresponded to 81% transmittance in Biolog's turbidimeter (data not shown). Omnilog PM plates PM-11C, PM-12B, and PM-13B are 96-well microtiter plates, with each plate containing 4 different concentrations of 24 different antibiotics or growth-inhibiting compounds. (Note that the concentration of each compound in each well is information proprietary to Biolog, Inc.) A complete list of the 72 compounds in these plates is available athttp://www.biolog.com/pdf/pm_lit/PM11-PM20.pdf. An inoculation mixture was prepared consisting of (per plate): 10 ml of IF-10b, 1 ml of PM additive (12×), 0.12 ml of dye mix H, and 0.88 ml of cell suspension. Each well was inoculated with 100 μl of the inoculation mixture and incubated at 37°C for 24 h in the Omnilog PM instrument (Biolog). Cell metabolism was monitored by the change in color of a redox dye. In the instrument, absorbance readings from all wells were automatically recorded at 15-min intervals and assigned arbitrary values (“Omnilog units”) from 0 to 350. All assays were performed using triplicate FL and GC samples. Antibiotics and growth inhibitors that displayed significant differences between FL and GC samples in the PM system were chosen for closer examination by the broth dilution assay, described below. Antibiotic resistance levels using broth dilution assays. The quantification of antibiotic resistance was determined by the broth dilution assay (36). Briefly, frozen FL or GC samples were thawed on ice as described above and immediately inoculated into liquid TSY plus 10% glycerol medium containing various concentrations of each test antibiotic in a 96-well microtiter plate format. To prevent evaporation, plates were sealed with gas-permeable membranes (Breathe-Easy membrane; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Plates were placed in a microplate absorbance spectrophotometer (model ELx808; BioTek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT) set at 37°C. Optical density at 620 nm (OD620) was recorded at 15-min intervals for 24 h. All assays were performed using triplicate FL and GC samples. Data set properties and analyses. The complete PM data set consisted of 2 conditions (FL versus GC) × 3 replicates × 3 PM plates × 96 wells per plate × 96 kinetic time points per well, resulting in a total of 165,888 data points in 1,728 kinetic curves. Data were exported into Microsoft Excel and the statistical environment R (37) for further analysis. R packages were obtained from the comprehensive R archive network (CRAN) athttps://cran.r-project.org/. Using the R package grofit (38), four growth models (logical, gompertz, gompertz.exp, and Richards) were fit to the data points of each curve. From the model, the software could calculate four statistical parameters for quantifying properties within each curve: length of the lag phase (λ), maximum growth rate (μ), maximum growth achieved (A), and area under the curve (AUC). Because the AUC is dependent upon the other three parameters, and thus is more broadly discriminatory, we chose the comparison of AUC values for the initial screening between FL and GC samples by PM. The complete broth dilution data set consisted of 2 conditions (FL versus GC) × 3 replicates × 10 antibiotics × 97 time points per curve, for a total of 5,820 data points within 420 curves. Best-fit curves were generated by spline interpolation using the R grofit software gcFitSpline, and the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) was computed for each sample over a range of antibiotic concentrations. IC50s were determined using A, μ, and AUC for every well. The parameters A and μ were included to separately analyze the dose response of the maximum growth rate and maximum OD of FL and GC samples. The three parameters were normalized by subtracting the corresponding parameter from the blank well and dividing by that from the control (i.e., no antibiotic) well. The normalized values were transferred into GraphPad Prism version 7.02 for Windows (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). GraphPad then calculated the IC50for each antibiotic by fitting to each sample a log(inhibitor) versus response nonlinear regression model with variable slope. All statistical analyses comparing FL and GC samples were performed using Student'sttests contained in the R statistical package stats (37). Differences withPvalues ≤ 0.05 were considered statistically significant. We thank the BRIC-21 payload development team (D. Dimapilis, A. D. Flowers, C. Grosse, J. Harp, D. Houze, H. Levine, G.
