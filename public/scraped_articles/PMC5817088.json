  "content": "Alterations in the Spectrum of Spontaneous Rifampicin-Resistance Mutations in theBacillus subtilis rpoBGene after Cultivation in the Human Spaceflight Environment Edited by:Ivan Mijakovic, Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden Reviewed by:Alexander Klaus Werner Elsholz, Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology (MPG), Germany; Anne Galinier, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), France *Correspondence:Wayne L. Nicholson,WLN@ufl.edu This article was submitted to Microbial Physiology and Metabolism, a section of the journal Frontiers in Microbiology Received 2017 Nov 15; Accepted 2018 Jan 29; Collection date 2018. In contrast to the classical view that mutations are random, a growing body of evidence indicates that exposure to environmental stresses in microbes can alter both the mutation rate and the mutagenic spectrum, supplying an increased variety of mutational outputs for selection to operate on and hence shaping the evolutionary trajectory of organisms (Nicholson and Maughan, 2002;Foster, 2007;Nicholson and Park, 2015;Maharjan and Ferenci, 2017b). This phenomenon, dubbed Stress-Induced Mutagenesis (SIM), has been most eloquently demonstrated in the recent work ofMaharjan and Ferenci (b).E. colicells were grown in chemostats under 5 different stresses, (limitation for carbon, phosphate, nitrogen, oxygen, or iron) or in a nutrient-rich environment, and loss-of-function mutations in thecycAgene leading to cycloserine resistance (CycR) were quantified, isolated, and subjected to fitness measurements (Maharjan and Ferenci, 2017b). Although only 2 out of 5 stresses led to a significant increase in the mutation rate to CycR, all stresses resulted in distinct spectra of mutations incycAconferring a variety of alterations in fitness of the resulting mutants (Maharjan and Ferenci, 2017b). The human spaceflight environment presents its own unique set of physical stressors, including cosmic radiation, microgravity, vibration, electromagnetic fields, and altered atmospheric compositions. Numerous studies have explored how microorganisms respond physiologically to spaceflight exposure (reviewed extensively inRosenzweig et al., 2014;Taylor, 2015). However, very few studies have asked whether microbial exposure to spaceflight might lead to SIM (Yatagai et al., 2000;Fajardo-Cavazos and Nicholson, 2016). Such studies are relevant to astronaut health risk assessment, given the role that microbial SIM may play in the emergence of antibiotic resistance or modifications to the astronaut microbiome. Long-duration human missions through interplanetary space to the Moon, near-Earth asteroids, or Mars are currently being planned (NASA, 2015), and both the National Research Council (NRC) and the International Space Exploration Coordination Group (ISECG) have assigned a high priority to studies aimed at better understanding astronaut health risks during space exploration. NASA has implemented a three-phase approach to its long-term goal of the human exploration of Mars1. The first phase, to be accomplished in the present-to-mid-2020’s time frame, is dubbed the “Earth Reliant” phase, focusing on research aboard the International Space Station (ISS), currently the only microgravity platform for the long-term testing of crew health systems and technologies needed to decrease reliance on Earth. To date, only two studies have been performed exploring the notion that exposure of microbes to the stresses of the human spaceflight environment might result in SIM. First,B. subtilisspores containing a plasmid encoding theEscherichia coli rpsLgene were exposed to spaceflight in space stationMirvs. matched ground controls (Yatagai et al., 2000). The frequency of mutations inrpsLleading to spectinomycin resistance (SpcR) was found not to be significantly different between spaceflight and ground control samples, but sequencing of the mutantrpsLgenes from 25 spaceflight and 38 ground control samples showed distinct differences in the spectrum of mutations leading to SpcR(Yatagai et al., 2000). Second, the frequency and spectrum of chromosomal mutations to rifampicin resistance (RifR) was measured inStaphylococcus epidermidiscells flown aboard the ISS and compared to matched ground controls (Fajardo-Cavazos and Nicholson, 2016). In this experiment the frequency of mutation to RifRwas observed to be significantly (24-fold) greater in the spaceflight samples. Sequencing of therpoBgene from 67 spaceflight and 57 ground control RifRmutants also showed that the spectrum of mutations to RifRwas clearly different in the flight vs. the ground control samples (Fajardo-Cavazos and Nicholson, 2016). For the present study we chose to use as the test organism the Gram-positive bacteriumB. subtilis, which possesses several advantages as a model organism: (i) it is easily cultivated and amenable to genetic manipulation; (ii) it forms dormant spores, making it an easy system to prepare for spaceflight; (iii) it is the best-studied Gram-positive bacterium; and (iv) development of its genetics, genomics, and molecular biology is highly advanced. Thus, using the well-developedB. subtilissystem will facilitate the investigation in further detail of any potential novel mutations isolated inrpoB. Bacterial Strain, Media, and Growth Conditions The strain used wasBacillus subtilisstrain 168 (trpC2) from the authors’ laboratory collection. Medium used throughout was trypticase soy yeast extract (TSY) medium consisting of (g/L): tryptone, 15; soytone, 5; NaCl, 5; yeast extract, 3; K2HPO4, 2.5; glucose, 2.5; final pH 7. For semisolid plates, agar was added to TSY at 15.0 g/L. For FL and GC experiments, glycerol was added to TSY liquid medium to 10% (v/v) final concentration, resulting in TSYG medium. As appropriate, the antibiotic rifampicin (Rif; Sigma–Aldrich) was added to TSY at a final concentration of 5 μg/mL.B. subtilisspores were routinely prepared by cultivation in liquid Schaeffer Sporulation Medium (Schaeffer et al., 1965) at 37°C with vigorous aeration. The culture was harvested when phase-contrast microscopic examination revealed that it consisted of >90% free spores, usually after 3–4 days of incubation. Spores were purified by lysozyme treatment, buffer washing, and heat shock (80°C, 10 min) as described previously (Nicholson and Setlow, 1990). Spores were determined by phase-contrast microscopy to be >99% free of cell debris and unsporulated cells, and were stored at 4°C in deionized water. The working suspension of spores contained 108colony-forming units (CFU) per mL. Aliquots of 0.1 mL (∼107CFU) of the suspension were applied to the bottoms of sterile 60-mm diameter Petri dishes (Falcon Cat. No. 1007) and air-dried for 48–72 h at room temperature prior to use. The experiments described here utilized Biological Research In Canisters (BRIC) spaceflight hardware, which has been described in detail previously (Paul et al., 2012). BRIC canisters can accomodate up to six samples. In these experiments, each BRIC was loaded with 5 Petri Dish Fixation Units (PDFUs). Each PDFU was loaded with a 60-mm Petri dish containing air-dried spores, and sterile TSYG medium was loaded into a separate reservoir. To prevent contamination, all reagents and equipment used were sterilized prior to use and PDFUs were assembled using aseptic technique within a Class 2 Biological Safety Hood. In the sixth sample chamber of each BRIC was placed a HOBO R temperature data logger (Onset Computer Co., Bourne, MA, United States). Post-flight asynchronous GC experiments were conducted using the same hardware and configuration as in the flight experiment. Flight (FL) and Ground Control (GC) Timelines Bacillus subtilissamples were flown on two separate experiments to the ISS, the 18th and 21st BRIC missions to space, designated BRIC-18 and BRIC-21. FL samples were launched on the 3rd and 6th SpaceX Cargo Resupply missions to the ISS (SpaceX-3 and SpaceX-6 CRS, respectively), using the Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon capsule configuration. Pertinent information regarding the activity timelines of these two missions can be found inTable1. Growth of samples was initiated in-flight and samples incubated for 122 h (BRIC-18) or 25 h (BRIC-21) before transfer to the onboard -80°C freezer. Frozen samples were returned to Earth in the Dragon capsule and were maintained in the frozen state until return to KSC for de-integration and further processing. Schedule of activities for BRIC-18 and BRIC-21 Flight (FL) and Ground Control (GC) experiments∗. ∗All dates are in the format year-month-day. Asynchronous GC experiments were performed in BRIC canisters according to the timelines determined during the FL experiments (Table1). Samples were incubated in the KSC ISS Environmental Simulation Chamber following the temperature regimes recorded during the flights (Fajardo-Cavazos and Nicholson, 2016;Morrison et al., 2017) and growth was terminated by transfer to a -80°C freezer, where samples were stored until further processing. Post-experiment Sample Processing In the BRIC-18 experiment, both FL and GC BRIC canisters were transferred from storage at -80°C to a +4°C refrigerator and samples allowed to thaw completely overnight. Liquid samples in Petri dishes were recovered from the PDFUs, transported to the laboratory on ice and further processed immediately. In the BRIC-21 experiment, both FL and GC samples were recovered from BRIC canisters in the frozen state, transported on dry ice to the laboratory, and stored at -80°C for later processing. Frozen samples were then thawed on ice, resuspended and processed immediately. In all instances, cells were detached from interior plate surfaces and resuspended using sterile disposable rubber spatulas. Resuspended cultures were transferred to sterile 15-mL conical centrifuge tubes, and the total recovered volume was measured. For viable counts, aliquots from cultures were diluted serially tenfold in TSY medium, dilutions plated on TSY plates, and colonies counted after incubation at 37°C for 24 h to obtain CFU/mL. To obtain the total CFU per PDFU, the CFU/mL were multiplied by the volume of liquid recovered. To select for RifRmutants, the remainder of each culture was concentrated by centrifugation, plated without dilution onto TSY + Rif plates, and colonies counted after incubation at 37°C for 24–48 h. The frequency of mutation to RifRwas calculated by dividing the total number of RifRmutants by the total number of viable cells from each sample. Individual RifRmutants were streak-purified on TSY + Rif plates and stored at -70°C in TSY + 25% glycerol, then processed for DNA sequencing. Primers used for PCR amplification of two RifRregions of theB. subtilis rpoBgene are listed inTable2. The correspondingrpoBregions were amplified directly from cells using 3 μL of culture from their respective glycerol stocks as DNA template, using the GoTaq®PCR kit (Promega, Madison, WI, United States) and the following thermal cycling conditions: 95°C, 2 min for the initial denaturation step, then 36 cycles of (95°C, 30 s; 55°C, 1 min; 72°C, 2 min), followed by a final elongation step (72°C, 5 min). PCR amplicons were purified and sequenced at the University of Florida Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research (BRIC-18) or at GeneWiz LLC (South Plainfield, NJ, United States) (BRIC-21). MultiplerpoBsequences were aligned using the online Clustal Omega server2(Li et al., 2015) to identify the position of mutations relative to the wild-typerpoBsequence obtained fromB. subtilislaboratory strain 168. In order to confirm the identity of novel (i.e., never-before-isolated)rpoBmutations, the corresponding region of the newly sequencedrpoBallele was amplified by PCR from each mutant and the resulting amplicon was introduced by transformation into competent cells of RifSB. subtilisstrain WN547 using standard procedures as described previously (Boylan et al., 1972;Nicholson and Maughan, 2002). From selected RifRtransformants, the corresponding region ofrpoBwas again PCR amplified and sequenced to confirm that the mutation had been transferred. Oligonucleotide primers used for amplification ofB. subtilis rpoBregions. Non-parametric statistical parameters and tests of significance (Kruskal–Wallis) were computed on log10-transformed data using Kaleidagraph version 4.5.2 (Synergy Software, Reading, PA, United States). Temperature Data in FL vs. GC Experiments Temperature data were logged at 10-min intervals during the FL and GC experiments and a summary of the data is presented inTable3. A detailed presentation of the temperature data can be found elsewhere (Fajardo-Cavazos and Nicholson, 2016;Morrison et al., 2017). Temperatures recorded during BRIC-18 and BRIC-21 FL and GC experiments. Viable cell counts were determined for both FL and GC samples recovered from the BRIC-18 and BRIC-21 experiments (Figure1). Because the data was determined not to be normally distributed, it was analyzed using non-parametric statistics. In the BRIC-18 experiment, cells grew to average total CFU per PDFU of 3.98 × 106(FL) and 1.10 × 107(GC); these values were determined not to be significantly different (Figure1). Ground-based growth kinetic experiments revealed that the rather low cell yield in the BRIC-18 mission was due to the prolonged incubation time (122 h) (data not shown). For the BRIC-21 mission, an increased cell yield was needed to provide sufficient sample mass for additional antibiotic susceptibility testing (Morrison et al., 2017) and RNA-seq analysis (to be published elsewhere). In ground experiments preparatory for the BRIC-21 mission, it was determined that an incubation time of 25 h resulted in higher cell yields, and that 25-h cultures were in the late-logarithmic to early stationary phase (data not shown). Accordingly, statistical comparison of the total CFU obtained between the BRIC-18 and BRIC-21 flights uncovered that cells grew to significantly higher titers in the BRIC-21 experiment, to an average total CFU per PDFU of 1.72 × 108(FL) and 2.13 × 108(GC) (P< 0.005). As found in the BRIC-18 mission, FL vs. GC titers within the BRIC-21 mission were determined to be not significantly different (Figure1).

Mutation Frequencies to RifRin FL vs. GC Samples The mutation frequency to RifRwas determined for both FL and GC samples recovered from the BRIC-18 and BRIC-21 experiments (Figure2). Because the data were determined not to be normally distributed, they were analyzed using non-parametric statistics. In the BRIC-18 experiment, cells exhibited an average mutation frequency of 6.9 × 10-6(FL) and 7.54 × 10-6(GC); these values were determined to be not significantly different (Figure2). In the BRIC-21 experiment, cells exhibited an average mutation frequency of 6.11 × 10-8(FL) and 1.94 × 10-8(GC); again, these values were determined to be not significantly different (Figure2). However, statistical comparison of the mutation frequencies to RifRobtained between the BRIC-18 and BRIC-21 flights revealed that cells demonstrated a significantly higher frequency of mutation to RifRin the BRIC-18 experiment (P< 0.007). Again, this may result from differences in the incubation times to which the cells were subjected–122 h in BRIC-18 vs. 25 h in BRIC-21–due to the well-documented phenomenon of stationary phase mutagenesis inB. subtilis(Robleto et al., 2007).

Spectrum of RifRrpoBMutations in FL vs. GC Experiments The N-cluster and Clusters I, II, and III of therpoBgene were PCR amplified fromB. subtilisstrain 168 and from the RifRmutants obtained from the BRIC-18 and BRIC-21 FL and GC experiments. Nucleotide sequences were determined from a total of 56 FL and 15 GC samples from BRIC-18 (Table4) and from a total of 72 FL and 38 GC samples from BRIC-21 (Table5). Both sets of data are summarized graphically inFigure3. Examination of the data revealed several striking differences in the mutational spectrum withinrpoBbetween the FL and GC samples.

Distribution of classes of RifRrpoBmutations appearing at least once in FL and GC samples∗. ∗Data are combined from BRIC-18 and BRIC-21 missions. Each class of mutation was scored as either present (X) or absent (blank) in the corresponding PDFU. Totals are tabulated in the rightmost two columns. RifRMutations Not Mapping to KnownrpoBRegions Historically, 4 regions inrpoBhave been associated with RifRin the model organismE. coli, designated as the N-cluster and Clusters I, II, and III (Figure3) (reviewed inSeverinov et al., 1993,1994). These clusters have been defined by the locations of RifRmutations as codons 127-135 (N-cluster), 463-489 (Cluster I), and 519-532 (Cluster II) (B. subtiliscoordinates). To date, inB. subtilisRifRmutations have never been identified in Cluster III or in intervening regions. However in 2 PDFUs from the BRIC-18 mission were isolated RifRmutants for which no mutation inrpoBwas found by sequencing the classic N-cluster or Clusters I, II, and III (Table4). This phenomenon has been reported before (Ahmad et al., 2012) and raises 2 formal possibilities. First, these mutations conferring RifRmight reside inrpoBbut outside the Clusters N, I, II, or III (it should be noted that our primer sets covered only ∼38% of the completerpoBsequence;Figure3). Second, the mutations may be located outsiderpoBentirely; low-level RifRhas been previously reported in mutants with altered permeability or efflux (Goldstein, 2014). In any event, because these mutants appeared in FL PDFUs, they may represent new allele(s) and warrant further investigation. Distribution of RifRrpoBMutations by PDFU Transitions vs. Transversion in FL and GC Samples As reported above, differences were observed in the location ofrpoBmutations in FL vs. GC samples inB. subtilisRifRmutants. These observations prompted us to examine the nature of nucleotide changes (i.e., transition vs. transversion mutations) in FL vs. GC samples from the BRIC-18 and BRIC-21 missions. In both FL and GC samples, A:G and C:T transitions predominated in both missions, and at relatively similar frequencies (Figure4). In addition, GC samples exhibited A:T, C:A, and G:T transversions that were not found in FL samples; conversely, FL samples exhibited T:A transversions that were not found in GC samples (Figure4). Thus, the spectrum of mutational classes (transitions vs. transversions) was also altered in FL vs. GC samples in both the BRIC-18 and BRIC-21 missions. Frequency of transition and transversion mutations in FL (cyan and blue bars) and GC (light green and dark green bars) samples ofB. subtilis rpoBin the BRIC-18 and BRIC-21 missions. Mapping RifRMutations on the Structure of RpoB Three-dimensional structures of RpoB elucidated from a number of bacteria (reviewed recently inMurakami, 2015) and supported by the crystal structure of RpoB in complex with Rif (Campbell et al., 2001), have revealed a great deal of structural conservation in the Rif-binding pocket. Rif binds in the concave surface of a roughly bowl-shaped depression in the RNA exit channel of RpoB, held in place both by direct H-bonding contacts and hydrophobic and ionic interactions with amino acids lining the pocket (Figure5). Amino acids Q469, F470, D472, H482, R485, and S487 make direct H-bonds with Rif (Campbell et al., 2001), and are most frequently associated with RifR(Severinov et al., 1993;Campbell et al., 2001); indeed we observed that mutations at these positions led to RifRin FL and GC samples. Amino acids in the N-cluster do approach the Rif-binding pocket, but not within the 6 Å distance depicted inFigure5. It is thought that substitution of amino acids containing relatively small side groups (V135, Q137) with bulkier side groups (F135, R137) can exert longer-range effects by distorting the binding pocket out of its optimum shape (Severinov et al., 1994). (Left)Schematic depiction of the Rif-binding pocket in the β-subunit of RNA polymerase, adapted from ref. (Campbell et al., 2001), usingB. subtilisamino acid coordinates. Amino acids located within 6 Å of Rif are denoted which: make direct H-bonding contacts with Rif (yellow boxes); make hydrophobic contacts (orange boxes); or form part of the binding pocket (green boxes).(Right)Table of locations and identities of amino acid (a.a.) substitutions leading to RifRin FL and GC samples. See text for details. A number of experiments have been conducted in which various bacterial species have been cultivated under otherwise-matching conditions of hardware, media, inoculation, etc., and their growth, as measured by final cell density, has been compared in spaceflight vs. ground control samples. Some of these prior studies have shown increased final cell density during spaceflight, while others have found either no significant differences between spaceflight and 1 ×gconditions (reviewed inBenoit and Klaus, 2007;Horneck et al., 2010;Kim et al., 2013;Rosenzweig et al., 2014;Coil et al., 2016), or even decreased growth in spaceflight (Fajardo-Cavazos and Nicholson, 2016). In both the BRIC-18 and BRIC-21 experiments described here, we measured no statistically significant difference in the final viable counts ofBacillus subtiliscells in FL vs. GC samples. As in most previous spaceflight experiments, the design of BRIC canisters does not allow growth measurements to be taken during the experiment, thus it was not possible to determine growth rates. However, the growth rate ofB. subtiliscells in spaceflight vs. matched ground control samples was directly measured in the SESLO (Space Environment Survivability of Living Organisms) payload of the O/OREOS nanosatellite, and in that experiment cells were observed to grow at a slower rate in spaceflight (Nicholson et al., 2011). Mutation Frequencies in FL vs. GC Samples Spectrum ofrpoBMutations in FL vs. GC Because RNA polymerase is a single enzyme responsible for transcribing all genes in a bacterium, mutations in its subunits can have far-reaching consequences for global regulation of the microbial transcriptome. In particular, mutations inrpoBhave been shown to cause Rif-independent physiological effects in a wide range of bacterial species (reviewed in ref.Koch et al., 2014). Such effects include: activation of cryptic metabolic capabilities (Perkins and Nicholson, 2008); alterations in the susceptibility to other classes of antibiotics (Kane et al., 1979;Kristich and Little, 2012); or production of various secondary metabolites (Hu et al., 2002). Furthermore, it has been shown that certain mutant alleles ofrpoBactually enhance the fitness of the resulting RifRmutants under specific environmental stresses, such as growth under nutrient-limiting conditions (Maharjan and Ferenci, 2017a). These physiologic effects could have profound consequences for long-duration missions in space, as microbes will continue to evolve in human space habitats. We are currently pursuing the idea that mutations induced by the stress of spaceflight may provide enhanced evolutionary fitness in the spaceflight environment itself. Understanding microbial evolution in space is crucial to better cope with wide-ranging challenges, from biofilm formation to biocorrosion of materials to alterations in the human microbiome.
