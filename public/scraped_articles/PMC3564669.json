Iwaniec, Ph.D., Skeletal Biology Laboratory, School of Biological and Population Health Sciences, 108 Milam Hall, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR 97331, Tel: 541-737-9925, Fax: 541-737-6914,urszula.iwaniec@oregonstate.edu A reciprocal association between bone marrow fat and bone mass has been reported in ovariectomized rodents, suggesting that bone marrow adipogenesis has a negative effect on bone growth and turnover balance. Mice with loss of function mutations in kit receptor (kitW/W-v) have no bone marrow adipocytes in tibia or lumbar vertebra. We therefore tested the hypothesis that marrow fat contributes to development of osteopenia by comparing the skeletal response to ovariectomy (ovx) in growing wild type (WT) and bone marrow adipocyte-deficientkitW/W-vmice. Mice were ovx at 4 weeks of age and sacrificed 4 or 10 weeks post-surgery. Body composition was measured at necropsy by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Cortical (tibia) and cancellous (tibia and lumbar vertebra) bone architecture were evaluated by microcomputed tomography. Bone marrow adipocyte size and density, osteoblast- and osteoclast-lined bone perimeters, and bone formation were determined by histomorphometry. Ovx resulted in an increase in total body fat mass at 10 weeks post-ovx in both genotypes, but the response was attenuated in the inkitW/W-vmice. Adipocytes were present in bone marrow of tibia and lumbar vertebra in WT mice and bone marrow adiposity increased following ovx. In contrast, marrow adipocytes were not detected in either intact or ovxkitW/W-vmice. However, ovx in WT andkitW/W-vmice resulted in statistically indistinguishable changes in cortical and cancellous bone mass, cortical and cancellous bone formation rate, and cancellous osteoblast and osteoclast-lined bone perimeters. In conclusion, our findings do not support a causal role for increased bone marrow fat as a mediator of ovx-induced osteopenia in mice. The physiological significance of bone marrow fat is currently a topic of debate [1–4]. Bone marrow fat is an important depot for storage of triglycerides. Fat depots generally act as energy reserves in which fatty acids are taken up by adipocytes from lipoproteins and subsequently released into the general circulation following lipolysis. Although bone marrow fat is highly labile [5], bone marrow adipocytes increase in number and sequester and esterify fatty acids during severe caloric restriction, suggesting that the bone marrow fat depot does not function as a typical energy reservoir for peripheral tissues [6]. Age-related reciprocal changes in bone marrow adiposity and bone mass are accelerated in humans following menopause, during disuse, and during treatment with glucocorticoids, and in animal models for pathological bone loss [7–12]. These findings have fueled speculation that increased marrow fat may lead to bone loss. Proposed mechanisms for the putative detrimental effects of marrow fat on bone metabolism fall into two general, though non-mutually exclusive, categories: 1) differentiation of stromal cells into adipocytes occurring at the expense of osteoblast differentiation, and 2) adipocyte production of factors (adipokines) which antagonize bone formation and/or increase bone resorption [13]. It is well established that osteoblasts and adipocytes are derived from a common bone marrow progenitor [14]. A deficiency in the transcription factor PPARγ reduces marrow fat and enhances osteogenesis in mice [15]. In contrast, osteoblast-targeted overexpression of PPARγ exaggerates ovariectomy (ovx)-induced osteopenia in mice [16], while PPARγ agonists are associated with bone loss in insulin-resistant humans [17]. Taken together, these findings suggest increased adipocyte differentiation curtails the differentiation of osteoblasts. Estrogen plays a key role in skeletal growth and maturation and in the maintenance of bone balance in adults [18]. As in humans, gonadal insufficiency in female rodents is associated with increased peripheral fat accumulation, increased bone marrow adiposity, accelerated bone turnover, and osteopenia [19–23]. However, in spite of a strong inverse association between bone marrow fat and bone mass, it has proven difficult to directly test the hypothesis that excess fat accumulation in bone marrow is responsible for ovx-induced osteopenia. In this regard, we recently reported thatkitreceptor-deficientkitW/W-vmice have no bone marrow adipocytes [24] but are able to produce osteoblasts and osteoclasts. We therefore reasoned that if bone marrow adipose tissue contributes to the detrimental skeletal effects of estrogen deficiency,kitW/W-vmice would be resistant to ovx-induced osteopenia. We tested this hypothesis by determining the effect of ovx on body composition, bone mass and architecture, and dynamic and cellular indices of bone turnover in growing WT andkitW/W-vmice. The experimental protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Animals were maintained under standard conditions with a 12-h light, 12-h dark cycle in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Food (standard chow) and water were providedad libitum. Two experiments were conducted in 4-week-old ovary-intact and ovx female WBB6F1/J-kitW/kitW-v(kitW/W-v) and wild type (WT) WBB6F1/J littermates purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). In the first experiment, WT andkitW/W-vmice were maintained for 10 weeks following surgery and sacrificed at 14 weeks of age to evaluate the long-term skeletal response to ovx. In the second, follow-up experiment, the mice were maintained for 4 weeks following surgery and sacrificed at 8 weeks of age to assess short-term skeletal response to ovx. Specifically, the follow up study was designed to evaluate whether lack of adipocytes influences the effects of ovx on cancellous bone formation. The fluorochrome calcein (Sigma, St Louis, MO) was administered at 20 mg/kg 7 and 1 days prior to sacrifice (14-week-old mice) or 4 and 1 days prior to sacrifice (8-week-old mice). The mice were anesthetized with 2–3% isofluorane delivered in oxygen and body composition determined via dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) using a PIXImus small animal densitometer (Lunar Corp., Madison, WI, USA). Death was induced by cardiac excision, and tibiae (both experiments) and lumbar vertebrae (experiment 2 only) were removed and stored in 70% ethanol for micro-computed tomography (μCT) and histomorphometric analysis. Tibial length was measured using digital calipers (Little Machine Shop, Pasadena, CA). μCT was used for nondestructive three-dimensional evaluation of bone architecture. Tibiae and lumbar vertebrae were scanned using a Scanco μCT40 scanner (Scanco Medical AG, Basserdorf, Switzerland) at a voxel size of 12 × 12 × 12 μm and evaluated at a threshold of 265 (gray scale, 0–1000). The threshold value was determined empirically. Total tibia (cancellous plus cortical bone) was evaluated followed by evaluation of cortical bone in the tibial diaphysis and cancellous bone in the proximal tibial metaphysis. For cortical bone, 20 slices (0.24 mm) of bone 0.7 mm proximal to the tibio-fibular junction were measured and cross-sectional tissue volume (cortical and marrow volume, mm3), cortical volume (mm3), marrow volume (mm3), and cortical thickness (μm) determined [25]. For the tibial metaphysis, 60 slices (0.72 mm) of bone beginning 0.75 mm distal to the growth plate were measured. Analysis of the lumbar vertebra included the entire region of secondary spongiosa between the cranial and caudal growth plates. Cancellous bone measurements in tibia and lumbar vertebra included cancellous bone volume/tissue volume (%), connectivity density (1/mm3), trabecular number (mm−1), trabecular thickness (μm) and trabecular separation (μm) [26]. Tissue area, bone area, osteoblast perimeter (osteoblast perimeter/bone perimeter, %) and osteoclast perimeter (osteoclast perimeter/bone perimeter, %) were measured. Adipocyte number and area were also measured and expressed as bone marrow adiposity (% tissue area occupied by adipocytes), adipocyte density (number/mm2) and mean adipocyte size (μm2). Adipocytes were identified morphologically as large circular or oval-shaped cells bordered by a prominent cell membrane and lacking cytoplasmic staining due to alcohol extraction of intracellular lipids during processing. This method was previously validated by fat extraction and analysis [5]. Fluorochrome-based indices of bone formation included: 1) mineralizing perimeter (cancellous bone perimeter covered with double plus half single fluorochrome label normalized to bone perimeter, %), 2) mineral apposition rate (the distance between two fluorochrome markers that comprise a double label divided by interval (3 days for cancellous bone) between label administration, μm/day), and 3) bone formation rate (calculated by multiplying mineralizing perimeter by mineral apposition rate normalized to bone perimeter, μm2/μm/yr). For cortical bone measurements in the tibia, undecalcified cross-sections (150 μm) were cut at the tibiofibular synostosis using a low-speed diamond-edge saw (Isomet; Buehler, Lake Bluff, IL, USA) and ground on a roughened glass plate to ~20 μm. Fluorochrome-based indices of cortical bone formation were measured in the diaphysis (periosteal or endocortical perimeters) on one cross section/bone and included: 1) mineralizing perimeter, 2) mineral apposition rate (6 day labeling interval for cortical bone), and 3) bone formation rate. Mineralizing perimeter, mineral apposition rate and bone formation rate were calculated as for cancellous bone. Two-way ANOVA was used to evaluate the respective effects of genotype, surgery and genotype x surgery interactions (SPSS 19.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Differences were considered significant at P < 0.05. All data are reported as mean ± SE. 3.1 Long-term Effects of Ovx on the Skeleton of WT and Bone Marrow Adipocyte-Deficient Mice The effects of genotype (WT vs.kitW/W-v) and surgery (ovary-intact vs. ovx) on total body mass (a), fat mass (b), and fat mass expressed as % body mass (c) in 14-week-old mice 10 weeks following surgery. Values are mean ± SE.aP<0.05 compared to ovary-intact within genotype,a*P<0.1 compared to ovary-intact within genotype. The effect of kit receptor deficiency and ovariectomy on total tibia bone volume and length and cortical bone architecture proximal to the tibio-fibular junction in 14-week-old mice at 10 weeks following surgery. The effects of genotype (WT vs.kitW/W-v) and surgery (ovary-intact vs. ovx) on cancellous bone volume/tissue volume (BV/TV) (a), osteoblast perimeter (Ob.Pm/B.Pm) (b), osteoclast perimeter (Oc.Pm/B.Pm) (c), endocortical mineralizing perimeter/bone perimeter (M.Pm/B.Pm) (d), mineral apposition rate (MAR) (e), and bone formation rate/bone perimeter (BFR/B.Pm) (f), periosteal M.Pm/B.Pm (g), MAR (h), and BFR/B.Pm (i), and on bone marrow adiposity (j), adipocyte density (k), and adipocyte size (l) in the proximal tibial metaphysis of 14-week-old mice at 10 weeks following surgery. Values are mean ± SE.aP<0.05 compared to ovary-intact within genotype.a*P<0.1 compared to ovary-intact within genotype. Representative microcomputed tomography images of cancellous bone in the proximal tibial metaphyses from intact WT, ovx WT, intactkitW/W-vand ovxkitW/W-vmice (a–d). Please note the lower bone volume in ovx compared to intact mice. Also shown are photomicrographs of histological sections from intact WT, ovx WT, intactkitW/W-vand ovxkitW/W-vmice showing adipocytes demarcated by an asterisk (e–h) in toluidine blue-stained sections from the proximal tibial metaphysis. Please note the absence of adipocytes in thekitW/W-vmice. Differences in endocortical and periosteal mineralizing perimeter, mineral apposition rate, or bone formation rate in the tibial diaphysis were not detected with genotype. Endocortical and periosteal bone formation rate was higher in ovx than ovary-intact mice. This increase was due predominantly to a greater increase in mineralizing perimeter at both envelopes. Significant genotype by surgery interactions were not detected for any endocortical or periosteal dynamic endpoints measured. 3.2 Short-term Effects of Ovx on the Skeleton of WT and Bone Marrow Adipocyte-Deficient Mice The effects of genotype (WT vs.kitW/W-v) and surgery (ovary-intact vs. ovx) on total body mass (a), fat mass (b), and fat mass expressed as % body mass (c) in 8-week-old mice 4 weeks following surgery. Values are mean ± SE.

Genotype had minimal effect on cancellous bone architecture in the proximal tibial metaphysis, with only trabecular thickness being higher in the 8-week-old WT compared tokitW/W-vmice. Ovx resulted in lower bone volume/tissue volume, connectivity density, trabecular number and trabecular thickness, and higher trabecular spacing. Significant genotype by surgery interactions were not detected for any of the cancellous endpoints evaluated. The effects of genotype (WT vs.kitW/W-v) and surgery (ovary-intact vs. ovx) on cancellous bone mineralizing perimeter/bone perimeter (M.Pm/B.Pm) (a), mineral apposition rate (MAR) (b), bone formation rate/bone perimeter (BFR/B.Pm) (c), bone marrow adiposity (d), adipocyte density (e), and adipocyte size (f) in the proximal tibial metaphysis and M.Pm/B.Pm (g), MAR (h), and BFR/B.Pm (i) in lumbar vertebra of 8-week-old mice 4 weeks following surgery. Values are mean ± SE.aP<0.05 compared to ovary-intact (intact) within genotype. Ovx in WT mice resulted in increased body mass and total body fat mass and decreased cancellous and cortical bone mass. The observed cortical and cancellous osteopenia was associated with increased bone marrow fat and increased cellular and dynamic indices of bone turnover. Similar ovx-induced changes in bone mass, architecture, and indices of bone turnover following ovx were observed inkitW/W-vmice in spite of absence of bone marrow adipocytes and an attenuated increase in total body fat mass. The above observations do not exclude the possibility that factors produced by adipocytes contribute to the negative bone balance observed at some skeletal sites in ovx rodents. Adipocytes produce factors, including TNF α and IL-6, known to inhibit bone formation and increase bone resorption [37]. On the other hand, not all adipokines are antiosteogenic; adipocytes also produce factors such as leptin and IGF-I which can increase bone formation [5,38–40]. Kit signaling is required for the ovx-induced increase in bone marrow adiposity in mice. In addition to an absence of bone marrow adipocytes, the kit receptor-deficientkitW/W-vmice have multiple abnormalities in fat metabolism. These abnormalities include hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia [44,45]. Chylomicrons, very low density lipoprotein, and intermediate density lipoprotein are also reported to be elevated. Additionally, the mutant mice have reduced lipoprotein lipase activity. Taken together, these findings suggest that kit signaling plays an important but not necessarily direct role in fat metabolism. Kit is required for differentiation and survival of mast cells and recent studies suggest that mast cells play an important role in obesity and diabetes by regulating adipocyte differentiation and function [46,47]. Interestingly, receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting kit signaling have been reported to reduce blood glucose levels in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia and decrease body weight in rodents fed a high fat diet [48,49]. The skeletal abnormalities observed inkitW/W-vmice are similar to those reported inkitSl/Sl-dmice [52].KitSl/Sl-dmice produce a protein similar to secreted kit ligand but are unable to produce membrane-associated kit ligand. Secreted kit ligand binds to and activates kit receptor but is unable to duplicate all of the actions of the membrane-associated ligand [51,54,55]. As a consequence,kitSl/Sl-dmice are sterile, anemic, osteopenic, have elevated osteoclast perimeter and have no marrow adipocytes [24]. Thus, activation of kit signaling through kit receptor by membrane-associated kit ligand appears necessary for differentiation of a variety of marrow-derived cells, including adipocytes. In summary, we replicated the previously reported inverse relationship between changes in bone mass and bone marrow adiposity in WT mice following ovx. Specifically, cortical and cancellous bone mass was decreased in ovx compared to ovary-intact WT mice while bone marrow adiposity was increased. We confirmed the absence of adipocytes in bone marrow ofkitW/W-vmice and showed that marrow adipocytes were not induced by ovx in the kit-deficient animals. Ovx resulted in increases in bone turnover and statistically indistinguishable changes in bone architecture in WT and bone marrow adipocyte-deficientkitW/W-vmice. These findings suggest that bone marrow adipose tissue is not required for development of cortical or cancellous osteopenia following ovx in growing mice. Compared to WT mice, kit receptor-deficientkitW/W-vmice had lower body fat and lacked bone marrow adipocytes. Adipocytes were present in bone marrow of WT mice and bone marrow adiposity increased following ovariectomy. Adipocytes were not detected in ovariectomizedkitW/W-vmice. Significant differences in bone response to ovariectomy were not detected between WT andkitW/W-vmice. Our findings do not support a causal role for increased bone marrow fat as a mediator of ovariectomy-induced osteopenia in mice.
