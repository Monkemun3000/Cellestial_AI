  "content": "The Space Omics and Medical Atlas (SOMA) and international astronaut biobank Received 2022 Dec 30; Accepted 2024 May 31; Issue date 2024. Spaceflight induces molecular, cellular and physiological shifts in astronauts and poses myriad biomedical challenges to the human body, which are becoming increasingly relevant as more humans venture into space1–6. Yet current frameworks for aerospace medicine are nascent and lag far behind advancements in precision medicine on Earth, underscoring the need for rapid development of space medicine databases, tools and protocols. Here we present the Space Omics and Medical Atlas (SOMA), an integrated data and sample repository for clinical, cellular and multi-omic research profiles from a diverse range of missions, including the NASA Twins Study7, JAXA CFE study8,9, SpaceX Inspiration4 crew10–12, Axiom and Polaris. The SOMA resource represents a more than tenfold increase in publicly available human space omics data, with matched samples available from the Cornell Aerospace Medicine Biobank. The Atlas includes extensive molecular and physiological profiles encompassing genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and microbiome datasets, which reveal some consistent features across missions, including cytokine shifts, telomere elongation and gene expression changes, as well as mission-specific molecular responses and links to orthologous, tissue-specific mouse datasets. Leveraging the datasets, tools and resources in SOMA can help to accelerate precision aerospace medicine, bringing needed health monitoring, risk mitigation and countermeasure data for upcoming lunar, Mars and exploration-class missions. Subject terms:Molecular biology, Medical research, Genetics An integrated data and sample repository for clinical, cellular and multi-omics research from diverse spaceflight missions known as Space Omics and Medical Atlas (SOMA) is presented. Before long-term space habitation is feasible, these biomedical challenges must be understood and mitigated. However, the aetiologies driving them are not understood, with the low number of astronauts yielding limited opportunities for in-depth biomolecular characterization. For example, two of the largest multi-omic studies to date have been the NASA Twins Study, which has published an in-depth molecular and cognitive profile of a single astronaut7, and the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Cell-Free Epigenome (CFE) project, which has profiled cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and cfRNA in six astronauts8,9. Thus, achieving statistical power requires integrating data from other cohorts, such as the MARROW study, and other missions5,10. Furthermore, these analyses are complicated by the substantial variation in physiological responses to spaceflight among astronauts. Therefore, there is a need for increasingly large, detailed multi-omic profiles of astronauts to characterize the diversity of physiological shifts as a function of spaceflight11. As with Earth-based cohorts13, these accessible data — when profiled and aggregated at scale — will enable the development of both personalized and general medical guidance for astronauts14. A large group of subject matter experts in artificial intelligence has recently released recommendations focused on the importance of generating and archiving space data into the NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR)15,16to enable autonomous and intelligent precision space health systems, and to monitor, aggregate and assess biomedical statuses for future deep space missions17. In addition, the study of the parallels between the physiological effects of spaceflight and ageing, chronic disease and immune system disorders using omics data can pave the way for therapeutics applicable to conditions on Earth. Comprehensive astronaut data resource Fig. 1. Compendium of astronaut omic data and time-series analysis paradigms. a, Omics and biochemical assays were performed on blood (whole blood, serum, PBMCs, plasma, plasma-derived EVPs and dried blood spots), oral (microbiome swabs), nasal (microbiome swabs), skin (biopsy and microbiome swabs), environmental (env.; microbiome swabs) and excrement (excrem.; urine and stool) samples.b, The timepoints of this study are separated into four different categories: pre-flight (L−92, L−44 and L−3), in-flight (FD1, FD2 and FD3), post-flight (R+1) and recovery (R+45, R+82 and R+194). The coloured circles indicate which assay was performed at each timepoint.

I4 reproduces NASA Twins Study Telomere elongation has been previously described in three astronauts who stayed for 6 months to 1 year aboard the ISS7,19,20, but it was unclear how quickly such a phenotype appeared in astronauts. The average telomere length in all I4 crew members increased during spaceflight (17–22% longer), and this trend was statistically significant (mixed-effects linear modelP= 0.0048; Fig.2a). This finding is particularly notable, given the shorter mission duration (3 days total) and higher elevation of the I4 mission than the ISS studies, indicating that telomere length dynamics respond much more rapidly to spaceflight than previously observed. Fig. 2. Telomere and cytokine Twins Study comparison. a, Normalized average telomere lengths for I4 crew members, pre-flight, during flight and post-flight, determined by qPCR analyses of blood (DNA) collected on dried blood spot (DBS) cards (n= 32 samples for 4 independent participants across 8 timepoints).

Distinct RNA fingerprints of spaceflight Beyond recapitulating known biomarkers of spaceflight, the atlas integrated newer assays that were not available in previous missions, with a particular emphasis on RNA profiling. The first novel assay was spatially resolved transcriptomics on skin biopsies, which were obtained from all crew members during one pre-flight timepoint (L−44) and the day after landing back on Earth (R+1). The 4-mm biopsies were stained with markers for DNA, PanCK, FAP and α-SMA and then processed with the NanoString/Bruker GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler, where regions of interest were selected based on the tissue structures identified by the fluorescence staining (Extended Data Fig.3a). After filtering out outliers, the RNA counts were used for downstream data analysis, generating 95 regions of interest across four skin compartments: outer epidermis, inner epidermis, outer dermis and vasculature (Extended Data Fig.3b,c). This analysis revealed a distinct set of DEGs, including JAK–STAT signalling, and melanocyte signatures (Fig.3). Extended Data Fig. 3. Transcriptomic Fingerprint of Short Duration Spaceflight.

NS, not significant; **P≤ 0.01; ***P≤ 0.001. A third novel RNA method applied to these spaceflight samples focused on RNA isoforms and RNA modifications (epitranscriptome), through dRNA-seq on the Oxford Nanopore Technologies PromethION and deep RNA-seq (more than 400 million reads per sample) on the Ultima Genomics UG100. These data quantified genes that were differentially expressed and displayed differentialN6-methyladenosine methylation (Extended Data Fig.4a,b), or both, and were analysed for enriched Gene Ontology pathways. We identified a set of sites (set M-I; Extended Data Fig.4b) that undergoes hypomethylation during recovery, another set (set M-II) that is detectably hypermethylated from spaceflight, and a set (set M-III) that exhibits novel hypermethylation during recovery and longitudinally as well. The common pathways in all three sets (Extended Data Fig.4b) showed evidence of radiation and telomere response, including ‘TSAI response to radiation therapy’ and ‘Wiemann telomere shortening’22. In addition, the set of downregulated pathways after landing (recovery) was distinct, including genes associated with breathing regulation (for example, CO2and O2take-up and release by erythrocytes), which matches those pathways associated with crew response ranges (below, Fig.5). Although further studies are needed to validate and delineate the potential mechanisms of these RNA dynamics (cfRNA, spatial and RNA modifications), these pathways suggest a potential relationship between RNA expression and methylation in regulating haematological and dermatological functions upon return to Earth.

Gene regulatory changes during recovery Leveraging the time-series data, we next analysed PBMC gene expression from snRNA-seq to discern whether unique DEGs are present at each timepoint. We examined DEGs from immediately post-flight (FP1) through the recovery profiles (RP1 and RP2) to observe how gene expression profiles are re-established after spaceflight. The number of DEGs was used to quantify the severity and recovery of crew response, and we also compared identified DEGs from a negative control group, including two healthy donors and read-depth- and cell-count-matched permutation group (Extended Data Fig.5), with an average of more than 700 cells per crew member, per timepoint, per cell type. The DEG count (adjustedP< 0.05, |log2fold change (FC)| > 0.5) decreased from FP1 to RP1 in CD16+monocytes, dendritic cells, natural killer cells, ‘other’ T cells (but not CD4+or CD8+), uncategorized (‘other’) cells and in pseudobulk (calculated from additive counts across cell types to represent PBMCs). However, the DEG count increased in B cells, CD4+T cells, CD8+T cells and CD14+monocytes (Fig.4a); by RP2, all cell types had lower DEG counts than at FP1 and began to approach the expected noise range of single-cell DEGs (Fig.4a). Extended Data Fig. 5. Single-Nuclei RNA-Sequencing Controls. (a) The number of DEGs in I4 flight profiles (FP1: grouped crew or individual crew members), I4 longitudinal profiles (LP3: grouped crew or individual crew members), and negative control groups (mock control day 2 vs day 1, mock control same day technical replicate differences, and I4 inter-subject comparisons in preflight). All comparisons were done with downsampling to the same number of cells. Intra-timepoint subject comparisons are crew-to-crew comparison in the pre-flight (L-92, L-44, L-3), immediately post-flight (R + 1), and recovery (R + 45, R + 82) time intervals. The bars show the mean of the total number of DEGs, and error bars show the standard error for groups that have 3 or more comparisons summarized. (n = 4 independent subjects with 6 timepoints, and n = 1 control subject with 2 timepoints and 3 technical scRNAseq replicates for each timepoint.) (b) The number of total DEGs identified by DESeq2 and pseudobulk counts in I4 flight profiles (FP1), I4 longitudinal profiles (LP3), and negative control groups (mock control day 2 vs day 1). All comparisons were done with aggregation into a single sample for each crew and each cell type. The bars show the mean of the total number of DEGs.

Bars are shaded by the false discovery rate (FDR) value, and the enrichment ratio is on thexaxis. As DEG counts were higher at RP1 than at FP1 for several cell types, we hypothesized the introduction of distinct DEGs after landing back on Earth. First, we calculated the percentage of DEGs unique to FP1 at both RP1 and RP2, focusing on cell-type-specific DEGs (Fig.4b). By LP2 (L−92, L−44 and L−3 versus R+82), we observed that nearly all differential gene expression was driven by the same set of genes that were differentially expressed at FP1, with the exception of CD14+monocytes, which had a unique longitudinal profile not strongly connected with the DEG responses in other cells. With the exception of CD14+monocytes, the RP1 profile is distinct in the abundance of DEGs not present in FP1, but this perturbation almost entirely (more than 95% of genes) disappeared after flight (RP2 and LP2). From the DEGs shared with FP1, we observed that gene expression directionality reversed for nearly all DEGs between FP1 and each recovery profile (Fig.4c), indicating a return to baseline for those DEGs. The exception to this were two genes from the CD14+monocyte population — AHR (log2FC of 0.742 (FP1) and log2FC of 0.808 (RP1)) and PELI1 (log2FC of 0.539 (FP1) and log2FC of 0.560 (RP1); Fig.4c) — in which there was a positive log2FC expression at both FP1 and RP1. Extended Data Fig. 6. Recovery Profile Analysis. (a) DEGs shared between the T cell and monocyte lineages for DEGs present in RP1, but not present in the FP1 profile. (b) Overrepresented KEGG pathways from DEG sets unique to the RP1 profile in the t-cell and monocyte lineages. The percent of pathways unique to each cell type are quantified along with the various configurations in which the pathway is shared between cell types and lineages. In addition, we found that certain pathways can be enriched across specific cell types belonging to different lineages. The inflammatory mediator regulation of the ‘TRP channel’ pathway, for example, was overrepresented in both CD8+T cells and CD14+monocytes, with each cell type contributing different gene sets associated with the pathway (Fig.4d). Other pathways, such as the IL-17 signalling pathway, contain mixtures of shared genes and unique genes and are significantly overrepresented across all cell types (Fig.4d). This also indicates that although cell types are distinct, they appear to have a set of core pathways in response to spaceflight, with 30–60% of overrepresented pathways shared both within and between lineages (Extended Data Fig.6b). To examine the chromatin accessibility and regulatory landscape in each cell population, we then analysed the transcription factor-binding site (TFBS) motif accessibility changes from snATAC-seq data to identify the top motifs in flight and recovery profiles (Extended Data Fig.7). We first observed that increased gene expression was correlated with more accessibility at the transcription start sites, and closed chromatin was associated with downregulated genes (allP< 0.05, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, for all cell types; Extended Data Fig.7a). The motif accessibility changes associated with recovery profiles recapitulated the trend in gene expression and chromatin accessibility data, which showed lower accessibility in regions of the genome with closed chromatin and higher expression in regions of more accessibility (Extended Data Fig.7b). In addition, we showed the top five upregulated and downregulated TFBS motifs per cell type in FP1, RP1 and RP2, which revealed both common and distinct motifs and their accessibility across cell types (Extended Data Fig.7c–e). These data also provided further evidence of cell-type specificity in the differences of chromatin and transcription factor accessibility dynamics. Extended Data Fig. 7.

(a-f) Abundance standardized CVs for the human omics assays across pre-flight, post-flight, and recovery time intervals. The most variable analytes are labeled at the top of each violin plot. CV is calculated across n = 4 independent subjects in 6 to 7 timepoints for p = 16283, 8464, 527, 1765, 656, 203 analytes respectively from a to f. The center dot represents the median, and the black line shows the range of the first and third quartiles. We then utilized the data across missions (I4, Twins Study and JAXA), assays (scRNA-seq, cfRNA, bulk RNA-seq and proteomics) and cell types (CD4, CD8, CD14 and CD16) to find the most recurrent pathways associated with spaceflight. The most enriched pathways were antigen binding, haemoglobin, cytokine signalling and immune activation, which confirmed the DEG-related signatures and also validated the signatures from our I4 mission (Fig.5). Moreover, the NASA Twins Study data and cfRNA profiles from the JAXA study confirmed many of the top-ranked pathways, while also showing differences between bulk blood RNA and protein markers and purified cell populations. These data indicate that leveraging both bulk and sorted cell populations can help to clarify signals coming from crew blood dynamics related to spaceflight. Access to datasets and crew samples This study introduces full accessibility of astronaut data to the scientific community. Datasets are accessible through an online web portal and scientific data repositories, as well as controlled access to more sensitive data (for example, genetic sequence data) and physical specimens. The online web portal splits the data into three data browsers: the SOMA browser, the I4 single-cell browser and the microbiome browser (Extended Data Fig.10a–c). The SOMA browser (https://soma.weill.cornell.edu/apps/SOMA_Browser/) enables visualization of gene expression (bulk RNA-seq, snRNA-seq, cfRNA-seq and spatially resolved transcriptomics), mass spectrometry (plasma proteomics, plasma metabolomics and plasma EVP proteomics) and microbial (metagenomic and metatranscriptomic) data. Gene expression and protein abundance are visualized for each astronaut by timepoint, with fold-change values, statistical significance (qvalue) and summary tables. Any selected gene is also then plotted across data for other missions, including the JAXA CFE study, the NASA Twins Study, mouse spaceflight datasets from NASA OSDR and Genelab, and control cohorts. For additional granularity, the single-cell browser (https://soma.weill.cornell.edu/apps/I4_Multiome/) provides visualizations specific to single-cell gene expression (scRNA-seq) and chromatin accessibility (scATAC-seq) data, and includes quality metrics, cell-type annotations, gene co-expression and chromatin accessibility magnitude estimates. Finally, the microbiome browser contains metagenomic and metatranscriptomic boxplots (https://soma.weill.cornell.edu/apps/I4_Microbiome/) from each timepoint of the study, spanning eight skin locations, deltoid swabs collected pre-skin biopsy, swabs of the SpaceX Dragon capsule and stool samples. Extended Data Fig. 10. SOMA Web Portals. (a) Three different web portals were created: SOMA Browser, Single-Cell Browser, and Microbial Browser. The SOMA Browser includes (b) gene expression and protein abundance measurements in line chart and volcano plot formats, (c) log fold change calculations, and (d) comparison of DEGs across different contrasts, assays, studies, and organisms (statistical tests dependent on comparison, please see website). (e) The Single-Cell Browser enables visualization of cell type specific information, including gene co-expression and ATAC-seq region peak visualization. (f) The Microbial Browser includes microbial abundances across timepoints from different annotation databases for metagenomic and metatranscriptomic datasets (n = 4 independent subjects for 8 timepoints and 12 collection sites, or n = 9 environmental samples for 4 timepoints). The center of the boxplots represent the median, the box hinges encompass the first and third quartiles, and whiskers extend to the smallest and largest value no further than the 1.5x interquartile range (IQR) away from the hinges. The remaining biospecimens from this study have been preserved and catalogued for continued use by the scientific community (https://cambank.weill.cornell.edu/). These samples include venous blood plasma, venous blood serum, viably frozen PBMCs, vacutainer red blood cell pellets, urine (both crude and with nucleic acid preservative), extracted saliva nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), extracted whole-blood total RNA, extracted skin swab nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and extracted stool nucleic acids (DNA and RNA). A subset of these samples will be available for additional assays and hypothesis testing by other groups, and the remainder are allocated for long-term biobanking. These data and specimen resources for astronauts can help enable larger cohorts for increased statistical power and also for new biomedical technologies that will emerge in the future. The cfRNA, dRNA and spatial RNA profiles revealed unique profiles that differed based on recovery and longitudinal analysis, suggesting that the multi-omic footprint of spaceflight is much wider than previously observed. Although some focused studies of cfRNA have shown that it can be used to detect mitochondrial increase in blood related to spaceflight7–9,24, to our knowledge, it had never been applied as a ‘full-body molecular scan’ to detect differential tissue and cell stress. Of note, the SOMA resource enables comparisons of the cfRNAs and cell-encapsulated RNAs, as well as the exosomal fractions, all within the same framework, which is essential for delineating and ranking the cells and tissues in the body that are the most disrupted by spaceflight. Similar to the utility of single-cell data23, the granularity of seeing cell lysis from all tissues across the body in one assay makes cfRNA profiling an ideal addition to some of the proposed standard measures for spaceflight monitoring. So far, cfRNA data indicate that each part of the body may show its own transcriptional response, shedding rate or RNA excretion rates, and thus each tissue should be examined on its own and then compared with other sites and assays. Similarly, in the microbiome data, the taxonomic classifications yielded differences in variation by body site, timepoint and crew member (Extended Data Fig.8), indicating the need for multi-site and multi-omic sampling for ideal understanding of microbiome changes associated with spaceflight. Molecular changes described here can also help to guide research and countermeasure development, but are only the start of the process of mitigating risks, especially as year-long and multi-year space habitat missions will represent greater biomedical challenges. To aid in this effort, the SOMA resource will continue to expand as further samples are sequenced from the I4 mission11,12and samples are collected from future missions that travel farther into space, and then compared with other longitudinal, multi-omics cohorts31. Biospecimen samples have been collected and processed from Polaris and Axiom crews, and this Atlas also represents an open call for research participation for astronauts from any commercial or governmental programs. Institutional Review Board statement All participants consented at an informed consent briefing at SpaceX, and samples were collected and processed under the approval of the Institutional Review Board at Weill Cornell Medicine, under protocol 21-05023569. All crew members consented to data and sample sharing. I4 data compendium data generation I4 versus NASA Twins Study cytokine analysis Differential abundance analyses of cytokines and other analytes were conducted using a mixed-effects model. This model included fixed effects for time, treated as a categorical variable with levels corresponding to preflight (L−92, L−44 and L−3), immediate return (R+1) and recovery periods (R+45, R+82 and R+194). In addition, participant-specific effects were incorporated as random effects in the model. ThePvalues for the coefficients obtained from this model were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure. 10x Genomics snRNA-seq negative control data We acquired cryovials of PBMCs from a healthy man 22 years of age (AllCells) and stored them in vapour-phase liquid nitrogen cryotanks. Two cryovials from this donor were thawed and processed on two different days in the same week, at the same laboratory, using the 10x Genomics demonstrated protocol called Nuclei Isolation for Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression Sequencing (CG000365). From each day’s nuclei suspension, ATAC and gene expression libraries were generated (in technical triplicates on the same chip) according to the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression User Guide (CG000338) and sequenced on a NovaSeq 6000 Sequencer. The resulting single-nucleus GEX and single-nucleus ATAC files were aligned using the cellranger-arc pipeline (v2.0.2) from 10x Genomics against the human reference genome hg38. Quality control and cell annotation were performed on the snGEX gene-cell matrices using the R Seurat package (v4.2.0)36. Subpopulations were clustered and labelled using a publicly available Azimuth human PBMC reference37in conjunction with Seurat’s supervised clustering functionality. DEG analysis for labelled subpopulations was performed using the FindMarkers functionality of Seurat, with a log fold change (logFC) cut-off point of 0.5.Pvalues of resultant genes were measured using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and deemed significant forP< 0.05. Correlation of chromatin accessibility and gene expression changes in FP1 was characterized by summing up the accessibility in a promoter window consisting of the transcription start site ± 500 bp for every cell in a given cell type across every gene, normalizing it to counts per million, taking the log2difference between the different timepoints and matching it to the log2FC from the differential RNA analysis. DEGs from each cell type from the PBMC 10x Genomics single-cell data were filtered for |logFC| > 0.5 and adjustedP< 0.05 for the FP1, RP1, RP2 and LP2 profiles. An UpSet plot of shared genes was generated using Intervene38. Overrepresented pathways were calculated using WebGestalt39using the default parameters and the KEGG database. Pathways included in the analysis were within the top 40 lowest false discovery rate values or all pathways with a false discovery rate under 0.05. Transcription factor motif accessibility analysis chromVAR40was used for the analysis of sparse chromatin accessibility from 10x Genomics single-cell data. The FindMarkers function of the Seurat package was used for differential analysis with setting mean.fxn as rowMeans and fc.name = “avg_diff”. The top five differentially accessible transcription factor motifs from each cell type from the PBMC 10x Genomics single-cell data for the FP1, RP1 and RP2 were selected for visualization by heatmaps. Heatmaps were generated by the ComplexHeatmap R package. Calculation of individual variation To distinguish the analytes that varied with the greatest magnitude between individual crew members (C001, C002, C003 and C004), a coefficient of variation (CV) calculation was applied across measurements collected for each: metagenomic species, metatranscriptomic species, plasma protein abundance, EVP protein abundance, metabolite abundance, cytokine abundances (Alamar Bio) and gene expression values (Oxford Nanopore dRNA-seq and Ultima RNA-seq). CV calculations were performed using the formula ‘np.std(x, ddof = 0)/np.mean(x)’, where ‘x’ is the array of normalized analyte values and ‘np’ refers to the numpy scientific computing package (v= 1.26). CV calculations were split into pre-flight (L−92, L−44 and L−3), post-flight (R+1) and recovery (R+45 and R+82) intervals. The metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data also include the in-flight (FD2 and FD3) interval. Before performing the CV calculation, data were first normalized. The ‘limma’ R package was applied to the plasma proteomic, EVP proteomic and metabolite data (v3.52). DESeq2 (v1.36.0) was applied to the Oxford Nanopore dRNA-seq and Ultima RNA-seq data. For microbiome data, to measure individual contributions per astronaut and for each tissue type (‘armpit’, ‘forearm’, ‘nasal’, ‘oral’, ‘post-auricular’, ‘T-zone’, among others), we averaged MetaPhlAn4, species-level, relative abundance values across our collected sample points. CVs were calculated for individual genes, proteins and microbial organisms. An abundance standardized CV calculation was also performed to correct for the mean/CV relationship in the assays. First, the normalized abundance values across all the analytes of a given dataset were split into approximately 100 mean-abundance quantiles (M_qwhereqis 1–100 or fewer, in case it resulted in less than 10 points per quantile group). For each quantile group, the mean and the standard deviation of CV values for the analytes belonging toM_qwere calculated (CVmean_qand CVs.d._q, respectively) to prepare the mean/CV distribution reference set across all timepoints and samples. Then, for a given timepoint, the CV calculated for each analyte was matched to the corresponding CVmean_qand CVs.d._qbased on cross-referencing to theM_qinterval overlap. Finally, the abundance standardized CV was calculated as thezscore of the CV as (CV − CVmean_q)/(CVs.d._q). Permutation testing of the post-flight versus pre-flight difference was performed by repeating this procedure 10,000 times on shuffled labels for samples, taking the difference. Rank andzscore of the observed value were calculated against the random permutations to order the genes and used as input to fGSEA for pathway enrichment analysis. Gene Ontology analysis on abundance standardized CVs was performed with Enrichr41,42using the default settings.
