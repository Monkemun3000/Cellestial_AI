Maintaining the proximity of centrosomes to nuclei is important in several cellular contexts, and LINC complexes formed by SUN and KASH proteins are crucial in this process. Here, we characterize the presumedDrosophilaortholog of the mammalian SUN protein, sperm-associated antigen 4 (Spag4, previously named Giacomo), and demonstrate that Spag4 is required for centriole and nuclear attachment during spermatogenesis. Production ofspag4mRNA is limited to the testis, and Spag4 protein shows a dynamic pattern of association with the germline nuclei, including a concentration of protein at the site of attachment of the single spermatid centriole. In the absence of Spag4, nuclei and centrioles or basal bodies (BBs) dissociate from each other after meiosis. This role of Spag4 in centriolar attachment does not involve either of the two KASH proteins of theDrosophilagenome (Klarsicht and MSP-300), but does require the coiled-coil protein Yuri Gagarin. Yuri shows an identical pattern of localization at the nuclear surface to Spag4 during spermatogenesis, and epistasis studies show that the activities of Yuri and dynein-dynactin are downstream ofspag4in this centriole attachment pathway. The later defects in spermatogenesis seen foryuriandspag4mutants are similar, suggesting they could be secondary to initial disruption of events at the nuclear surface. Within eukaryotic cells, a centrosome or spindle-pole body (SPB) functions as a microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) and is typically found closely apposed to the nuclear membrane. Disruption of the MTOC-nucleus association frequently leads to cellular abnormalities, including defective nuclear positioning (Malone et al., 1999;Starr et al., 2001), abnormal morphology of cells and organelles (Fischer-Vize and Mosley, 1994;Mosley-Bishop et al., 1999;Patterson et al., 2004), altered cell migration (Gomes et al., 2005;Lüke et al., 2008) and defective chromosome segregation during mitosis (Malone et al., 2003;Xiong et al., 2008). These findings indicate that the nuclear-MTOC association is essential in many cellular processes. Nuclear-MTOC association is often maintained by a LINC complex comprising SUN (Sad1/UNC) and KASH (Klar-ANC-Syne homology) proteins (Gruenbaum et al., 2005;Starr and Fischer, 2005;Crisp et al., 2006;Stewart-Hutchinson et al., 2008). SUN and KASH proteins are integral membrane proteins of the inner and outer nuclear membranes (INM and ONM), respectively. These proteins interact with each other in the intermembrane space via their C-terminal SUN and KASH domains (McGee et al., 2006;Kracklauer et al., 2007). The N-terminal domains of SUN proteins face the nucleoplasmic side of the INM, interacting with the nuclear lamina or with chromatin (Bray et al., 2002;Hodzic et al., 2004;King et al., 2008;Xiong et al., 2008). N-terminal domains of KASH proteins typically face the cytoplasm, and interact with components of the actin or microtubule filament systems (Starr and Han, 2002;Zhang et al., 2002;Fischer et al., 2004;Wilhelmsen et al., 2005;Ketema et al., 2007). A detailed model for the mechanism by which theCaenorhabditis elegansKASH protein ZYG-12 links the zygotic centrosome to the nuclear envelope (NE) has been proposed (Malone et al., 2003), which involves direct interaction of certain ZYG-12 isoforms with the microtubule motor dynein. Splicedspag4mRNA is found only in testes and encodes a transmembrane domain protein We first analyzed the expression ofspag4mRNA by RT-PCR, and observed that spliced mRNA is found only in male larvae, pupae and adults (Fig. 1A), suggesting testis-specific expression. Expression ofspag4mRNA characterized atwww.flyatlas.orgconfirms this testis specificity. In situ hybridization demonstrated thatspag4mRNA expression peaks in the early primary spermatocyte region of adult testes (Fig. 1B). Low levels of the unspliced precursor transcript were observed in females (Fig. 1A), but appear to be functionless given the viability and fertility ofspag4-null females (see below). spag4expression,spag4knockout and fertility assays.(A)spag4mRNA (~800bp) is limited to males, but low levels of the primary transcript (~1000 bp) are present in male and female pupae and adults.

Although all SUN proteins described to date have a transmembrane (TM) domain N-terminal to the SUN domain (Hagan and Yanagida, 1995;Malone et al., 1999;Shao et al., 1999;Dreger et al., 2001;Malone et al., 2003;Hodzic et al., 2004;Kracklauer et al., 2007;Liu et al., 2007), the originally annotated Spag4 protein sequence contains no TM domain (Tweedie et al., 2009). Using 5′ RNA-ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RLM-RACE), we identified 5′spag4mRNA sequences encoding an N-terminus with a single TM helix (Fig. 1C). 3′ RACE also revealed a previously uncharacterized 3′ UTR. The correctedspag4gene region spans ~1.2 kb of genomic DNA (Fig. 1C).

Focus of Spag4:6×MYC at centriolar attachment site and along dense complex microtubules (e.g. arrowhead) in early elongating spermatids (G-G″). A concentration of Spag4:6×MYC at the apical tip of elongating spermatid nuclei (H,I′) is shown by the basal body marker YFP:Asl (I) to lie between the BB and the nuclei proper (I″). This Spag4:6×MYC focus persists on mature sperm in the seminal vesicle (J), similarly to the BB marker YFP:Asl (K). Red, Spag4:6×MYC; blue, DAPI; green, γ-tubulin in F, α-Tub:GFP in G″, YFP:Asl in I and K, Spag4:GFP in J. Scale bars: 150 μm (A), 20 μm (B-G,J,K) and 10 μm (H,I). Once meiosis is complete, the single centriole of each round spermatid attaches to its nuclear surface, and dramatic morphological changes commence. The centriole differentiates into the BB, from which the axoneme develops, and the nuclei elongate and condense to a needle-like shape. The Spag4:6×MYC protein at the NE initially transformed into a hemispherical cap (the ‘cap’) with the centriole at its apex (Fig. 2F). Subsequently, on the elongating nuclei, Spag4:6×MYC assumed a two-component pattern, with a focus of the protein at the centriole or BB attachment site, and a stripe of protein along the long axis of the nuclei (the ‘stripe’). From EM studies, Tokuyasu (Tokuyasu, 1974) identified electron-dense material, termed the dense complex, which initially formed as a pericentriolar hemispherical cap on round spermatid nuclei and was later present as a stripe rich in microtubules along the length of the elongating nuclei. That the stripe of Spag4:6×MYC is at the position of the dense complex was established by colocalization in testes expressing α-tubulin:GFP (Fig. 2G-G″). As elongation proceeded, the Spag4:6×MYC stripe along the dense complex gradually disappeared, and the focus at the BB became more compact and assumed a distinctive trefoil or bell shape (Fig. 2H). As shown by colocalization with the pancentriolar marker YFP:Asl (Varmark et al., 2007) (Fig. 2I-I″), this focus of Spag4 protein was between the caudal nuclear tip and BB, thus placing it at the ~0.5 μm indentation (the ‘dent’) in the nucleus in which the BB sits (Tokuyasu, 1975). Spag4:GFP persisted on sperm nuclei in the seminal vesicle (Fig. 2J), as did YFP:Asl (Fig. 2K), suggesting that Spag4 remains at the BB attachment site in mature sperm. This dynamic pattern of Spag4 localization is unusual; other SUN proteins localize specifically to the NE (Malone et al., 1999;Malone et al., 2003;Hodzic et al., 2004;Kracklauer et al., 2007;Liu et al., 2007), microtubules (Shao et al., 1999) or the MTOC or SPB (Hagan and Yanagida, 1995;Xiong et al., 2008). However, this range of localizations for Spag4 might be more a property of the developmental process in question rather than the protein. So far, other SUN proteins have been studied in less complex developmental situations. The initial defect inspag4mutant males is failure of centriole-nuclear attachment To address the role of Spag4 during sperm development, we analyzed spermatogenesis in thespag4-null mutant. Our goal was to identify the first detectable defects caused by the mutation, because later problems might be secondary to these initial failures. Despite the association of Spag4 with the NE of the primary spermatocyte, in thespag4mutant, the primary spermatocyte stage appeared similar to the wild type (Fig. 3A,D). However, beginning in the round spermatid stage, some disruption of the centriole linkage was detectable (Fig. 3B,E), which became pronounced and fully penetrant as the nuclei condensed and elongated. In contrast to the wild type (Fig. 3C), in all elongatespag4mutant nuclear bundles examined, BBs labelled with YFP:Asl had lost their normal association with the caudal nuclear tips and were scattered along the nuclear bundles (NBs) (Fig. 3G). Furthermore, every NB observed showed some degree of dispersion within the cysts, and the scattered nuclei frequently curled in the terminal region of the testis (Fig. 3H). These findings indicate that Spag4 is required to maintain the correct centriole-nuclear association, and has a role in shaping elongated nuclei. Nuclear-centriolar dissociation during elongation stages is the earliest visible defect inspag4mutant testes.Centriolar association with primary spermatocyte (A), round spermatid (B) and elongating (C) nuclei in wild-type testes. Inspag4mutant testes, centriolar association is normal in primary spermatocytes (D) and mostly normal in round spermatids (E), and early elongating spermatids (F).

Black lines denote axis through the central doublet of the axoneme; within a wild-type cyst, spermatid cross-sections (red lines) lie at a constant angle (clockwise 45° to the central doublet. (E) Inspag4mutant cysts, aberrant angles demonstrate spermatid-axoneme misalignment. Red arrowhead indicates missing central doublet inspag4axoneme. Images in D and E were taken in comparable regions of wild-type and mutant testes (towards terminal epithelium, immediately apical to cyst coiling region). Black arrows indicate major mitochondrial derivatives (MDs) and white arrows, minor MDs. Black arrowhead in D indicates plasma membrane. Both major and minor MDs are less condensed inspag4mutant than in the wild type, and large regions of ribosome-rich cytoplasm persist in the cysts (blue dotted line). Scale bars: ~10 μm (A-C), 500 nm (D,E). Phenotype comparisons suggest interactions withyurianddynein-dynactinbut not known KASH proteins spag4encodes a SUN protein and localizes to the NE during most of spermatogenesis. Furthermore, the SUN domain is essential for the role ofspag4in male fertility (Fig. 1F). These findings suggest that Spag4 functions as a typical SUN protein, forming a LINC complex with a KASH protein partner. However, our data indicate that neither of the twoDrosophilaKASH proteins (Klarsicht and MSP-300) is a Spag4 partner in the testis. For both genes, mutations that eliminate the KASH domain are available:msp300ΔKASHwas generated by ends-out recombination (Xie and Fischer, 2008) and theklarCD4mutation came from EMS mutagenesis that generated a suitably positioned stop codon (Mosley-Bishop et al., 1999;Fischer et al., 2004;Guo et al., 2005). Mutant males of both genotypes were fertile (Fig. 5A) and in all cysts examined formsp300ΔKASHmales,klarCD4males andmsp300ΔKASH; klarCD4double-mutant males, (44-95 cysts in 10 testes per genotype), the centrioles remained associated with the spermatid nuclei during elongation (Fig. 5B-D) and nuclear bundling, IC formation and IC progression were normal. There was no heterozygous effect of thespag4-null genotype on the fertility ofklarCD4mutant males (Fig. 5A) and the only aberrancy detected in the spermatid cysts of these various genotypes was the occasional apical mislocalization of nuclear bundles inklarCD4andmsp300ΔKASH; klarCD4double-mutant males (data not shown). The doubly mutant males were somewhat subfertile (Fig. 5A), but this probably reflects defects in the testis sheath (data not shown) that are not found in the singly mutant males. Spag4 and Yuri localize to nuclear envelopes, cap, BB dent and stripe during spermatogenesis.Spag4 and Yuri localization at the NE of primary spermatocytes (A,B), at the centriolar cap on round spermatids (C,D) and in the BB dent and stripe on elongating nuclei (E,F) are compellingly similar.F′ shows Yuri localization on a single elongate nucleus. In thespag4mutant, Yuri fails to localize to the NE of primary spermatocytes (G) and to the centriolar cap (H) and the BB dent and stripe (I) at later stages. However, Yuri accumulates on the BB and overlays the CA (I).I′ also shows absence of Yuri stripe and Yuri accumulation on BB for a single nucleus. Upper arrows in F′, I′ show position of BB, lower arrows show position of stripe. Yuri accumulation on the centrioles of primary spermatocytes is also intermittently seen in thespag4mutant (arrow, G). InyuriF64, most elements of the Spag4 localization pattern remain (J,K) but accumulation at the BB dent is lost (L). Control genotypes: in A,w;; spag4:gfp; in C,E,w;; spag4:6xmyc; in B,D,F,F′,w1118. Scale bars 25 μm (A,B,G,J), 15 μm (C,D,H,K), 10 μm (E), 6 μm (F,F′,I,I′,L). Interactions betweenspag4,yurianddyneincomponents Conversely, in theyuriF64mutant, Spag4:6×MYC accumulation on the primary spermatocyte NEs, the meiotic spindles, and in the cap and stripe remained unaltered (Fig. 6J,K,L). However, one element of the Spag4 distribution pattern was lost: Spag4:6×MYC no longer accumulated at the dent representing the BB attachment site (Fig. 6L). Thus, with the exception of this site, the interactions between the two proteins are very similar to those predicted for a SUN-KASH protein pair. The effect of loss of the dynein cap at the round spermatid stage (in aDlc90F-null mutant) on the nuclear location of Yuri was reported by Texada and co-workers (Texada et al., 2008). Notably, the effect is similar to that described here upon loss of Spag4: the Yuri cap is strongly reduced, the stripe and dent components never develop, and Yuri accumulates on the BB proper. Thus bothspag4and dynein have a role in positioning Yuri on the NE. That Yuri has no role in positioning dynein was determined by examining the location of p50:GFP, a tagged subunit of a dynactin, which is a well-established dynein interaction partner (Wojcik et al., 2001). p50:GFP shows identical localization to dynein at the nucleus and meiotic spindles during spermatogenesis (Li et al., 2004;Anderson et al., 2009), including accumulation in the cap on round spermatid nuclei. In theyuriF64mutant, this localization pattern for p50:GFP on the spermatid nuclei remained unchanged (Fig. 7G). Spag4 functions independently of a LINC complex Spag4 and Yuri are components of a postmeiotic pathway for maintaining the centriole at the spermatid nucleus In contrast to the KASH proteins, our studies have identified the coiled-coil protein Yuri as an essential component of the postmeiotic Spag4 centriole-tethering pathway. In the post-meiotic stages, Yuri shows identical nuclear positioning to Spag4, and Spag4 is essential for localization of Yuri to its various nuclear sites. These observations place Yuri downstream of Spag4 in the pathway. However, at the nuclear dent, in which the BB sits, there is mutual dependence between the two proteins for correct localization. In addition to this post-meiotic pathway, a pre-meiotic mechanism exists to bring the centriole pairs of the primary spermatocyte to the NE for function in meiosis. The geneasunder(asun) is required for this process, which involves accumulation of Asun itself, and Asun-dependent accumulation of dynein (and p50:GFP) at the primary spermatocyte NE (Anderson et al., 2009). As we show here, both Spag4 and Yuri also associate with the primary spermatocyte NE, with localization of Yuri there being Spag4-dependent. However, in contrast to anasunmutant, no defects in meiosis were found inyuriF64orspag4-null spermatocytes. Thus, no immediate role for the two proteins in pre-meiotic centriole-nuclear association can be postulated. During meiosis, Spag4 is associated with the spindle and astral microtubules. Although a role for SUN proteins in tethering telomeres to the NE during meiosis has been described (Ding et al., 2007;Penkner et al., 2007), we could not detect altered telomere distribution inspag4-null meiosis (data not shown). The functions of Yuri and Spag4 in these early stages are thus obscure. Association of Spag4 with the spindle could simply represent a storage location. The interaction of Yuri and Spag4 in relation to nuclear membrane topology If Spag4 were a typical SUN protein, its transmembrane domain would traverse the INM, placing its C-terminus in the intermembrane space to interact with a KASH-domain protein spanning the ONM. However none of the isoforms of Yuri has either a transmembrane domain or KASH domain, indicating that a direct interaction between the two proteins in the intermembrane space is unlikely. Thus, despite our evidence that the two knownDrosophilaKASH proteins have no role here, it seems likely that some other ONM protein is needed to bring Yuri and Spag4 together. Our findings on the role of cytoplasmic dynein-dynactin also make a direct interaction of Yuri and Spag4 unlikely. The order of gene action in the pathway appears to bespag4–dynein-dynactin–yuri, again probably precluding a direct Spag4-Yuri interaction. Differing molecular activities at the dent and the stripe The pathway described above is adequate to address the relationship of Yuri and Spag4 at most elements of their nuclear-localization patterns. However, at the dent, further interactions must be invoked, because at this site, localization of the two proteins is mutually dependent. This role of Yuri in positioning Spag4 is unlikely to involve dynein-dynactin, because Yuri has no effect on the localization of p50:GFP(dynactin) at the nuclear surface. Thus additional molecular interactions must take place. Yuri has three isoforms, and it is possible that at this site, an isoform not active at the other locations is in operation (see further discussion below). Our antibody detects all Yuri isoforms, and thus provides no information on individual isoform location. Similarities to the SUN1-ZYG-12 interaction pair – different roles for Yuri isoforms? Successful sperm individualization correlates with maintenance of the BB-nucleus link and with properly shaped and bundled elongated nuclei How BB detachment from nuclei and nuclear contortion would affect formation of individual actin cones and progression of the IC is not apparent. One possibility is that components of the dense complex at the cap and/or stripe are requisite precursors for formation of actin cones. Actin cone formation begins with the deposition of F-actin filaments along the long axis of the nuclei (Noguchi et al., 2008). The dense complex materials at the cap and the stripe contain F-actin, and this F-actin is lost inyuriF64(Texada et al., 2008). EM examination of the formation of F-actin filaments on the final nuclei of thespag4, yuriF64andPros-α6Tmutants would address this issue. The male sterile mutationms(3)72Dalso produces contorted spermatid nuclei (Castrillon et al., 1993) and might thus also be defective in BB-nuclear attachment, actin cone and IC formation, and sperm individualization. In summary, we have identified Spag4 as a component of a centriolar-nuclear attachment pathway in spermatogenesis that also requires the coiled-coil protein Yuri and cytoplasmic dynein-dynactin. Although Spag4 is a SUN protein, its action in this pathway appears not to involve a conventional KASH protein. The disruption of the later stages of spermatogenesis inyuriandspag4mutants might be secondary to the general disruption of events at the spermatid nuclear surface produced in these mutants. Total RNA from ten male or female larvae, pupae and adults was isolated and treated with DNase I, as described (Kracklauer et al., 2007). RT was performed using an oligo (dT) primer followed by PCR with primers P1 and P2. Determination ofspag4cDNA ends by RACE RT-PCR was carried out using male pupal total RNA isolated as recommended in the FirstChoice RLM-RACE kit protocol (Ambion, Austin, TX), and then used in 5′ RLM-RACE and 3′ RACE. The 5′ end of the gene was amplified using the RNA adapter-specific forward outer and inner primers, and the gene-specific reverse primer P3. To amplify the 3′ end of the gene, anchored oligo-(dT) adapter primers from the FirstChoice kit were used in RT. In the PCR, the gene-specific forward primer P4 and the 3′ adapter-specific outer primer were used. 5′ and 3′ RACE products were subcloned into pGEM-T-Easy (Promega, Madison, WI) and their sequences verified. A completespag4cDNA with 5′ and 3′ UTRs was generated by PCR using a mixture of partially overlapping RACE products as template and the 5′ and 3′ adapter-specific primers. The final PCR product was subcloned into pGEM-T-Easy, sequenced and catalogued asEF537040at NCBI. Construction ofspag4genomic transgenes The transgenepC4-spag4was generated by ligating thespag4coding region as a 4.9 kbPstI fragment fromBACR02J20into thePstI site ofpCaSpEr-4(pC4) (Thummel and Pirrotta, 1992). The GFP-tagged version,pC4-spag4:gfp,was generated by ligating the GFP ORF frompUAST-gfp(Kracklauer et al., 2007) immediately downstream of thespag4coding region inpC4-spag4. For this purpose, anAscI site was introduced immediately upstream of thespag4stop codon using the QuikChange II PCR Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) and primer pair P13-P14. The GFP ORF withAscI sites on both ends (generated by PCR using primers P11-P12 on thepUAST-gfptemplate) was then cloned into thisAscI site. To generatepC4-spag4:6xmyc, a6xmycORF was amplified from thepUAST-6xmycvector (Kracklauer et al., 2007) using the PCR primers P15 and P16, and the ORF was then cloned into theAscI site as forpC4-spag4:GFP. To generatepC4-spag4SUNstop, a stop codon was introduced into the 4.9 kbPstI fragment using the mutagenic primers P21-P22, and the resulting mutated fragment was cloned into thePstI site ofpC4as described above. Twenty individualspag4homozygousor spag4/Df(2L)Prlmales were each crossed to twow1118virgins. As a control, 20 crosses usingw1118males homozygous for a wild-type (Oregon-R) copy of chromosome 2 (w1118;ORC2iso) were set up. For the fertility rescue assays, 20 individualspag4homozygous males bearing a single copy of the transgenepC4-spag4,pC4-spag4:gfp,pC4-spag4:6xmycorpC4-spag4-SUNstopwere used. To assay female fertility, 20 virginspag4homozygous orspag4/Df(2L)Prlfemales were assayed individually with twow1118males. Similar crosses withw1118; ORC2isovirgin females were set up in parallel as wild-type controls. After 1 week, average combined numbers of larvae and pupae per vial were determined. Testes were fixed on ice for 2 hours in PBS with 2% glutaraldehyde [Electron Microscopy Sciences (EMS), Hatfield, PA], rinsed, then post-fixed at room temperature for 2 hours in 2% OsO4(EMS) and 0.8% K3[Fe(CN)6] in 1× symcollidine buffer (McDonald, 1984;Jinguji and Ishikawa, 1990). Tissues were then dehydrated and embedded in resin using standard procedures. 50-60 nm sections were cut, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined with a Philips EM208 electron microscope. Testes were fixed and stained essentially as described (Lin et al., 1996;Zhong and Belote, 2007;Texada et al., 2008), and mounted in VectaShield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) or 50% glycerol. Primary antibody dilutions were as follows: mouse anti-MYC, 1:2000; rabbit anti-MYC, 1:200; rabbit anti-CM1, 1:100 (all from Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA); rabbit anti-Vasa, 1:200 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); mouse anti-γ-tubulin, 1:500 (Sigma) and chicken anti-Yuri, 1:400 (Texada et al., 2008). Secondary antibodies were Alexa Fluor 488 anti-rabbit, Alexa Fluor 555 or Alexa Fluor 568 anti-mouse and Alexa Fluor 488 anti-chicken, all at 1:500 (Invitrogen). Alexa Fluor phalloidin (Invitrogen) to stain F-actin and TOPRO-3 to stain DNA, were mixed into secondary antibody solutions at 15 μl phalloidin/ml and 1 μl/ml TOPRO-3. DAPI for DNA staining was added to mounting solution at 1 μl/ml. Testes were imaged with Leica AOBS SP2 and Zeiss LSM 510 laser-scanning confocal microscopes and a Zeiss Axioplan microscope using Metamorph deconvolution software. Adobe Photoshop was used to process all images. ISH was carried out essentially as described (White-Cooper et al., 1998), using an 820 bp PCR product from thespag4ORF to generate sense and antisense probes by in vitro transcription with a DIG RNA Labeling Kit (Roche).
