Fungi are versatile organisms which thrive in hostile environments, including the International Space Station (ISS). Several isolates of the human pathogenAspergillus fumigatushave been found contaminating the ISS, an environment with increased exposure to UV radiation. Secondary metabolites (SMs) in spores, such as melanins, have been shown to protect spores from UV radiation in other fungi. To test the hypothesis that melanin and other known spore SMs provide UV protection toA. fumigatusisolates, we subjected SM spore mutants to UV-C radiation. We found that 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN)-melanin mutants of two clinicalA. fumigatusstrains (Af293 and CEA17) but not an ISS-isolated strain (IF1SW-F4) were more sensitive to UV-C than their respective wild-type (WT) strains. Because DHN-melanin has been shown to shieldA. fumigatusfrom the host immune system, we examined all DHN mutants for virulence in the zebrafish model of invasive aspergillosis. Following recent studies highlighting the pathogenic variability of differentA. fumigatusisolates, we found DHN-melanin to be a virulence factor in CEA17 and IF1SW-F4 but not Af293. Three additional spore metabolites were examined in Af293, where fumiquinazoline also showed UV-C-protective properties, but two other spore metabolites, monomethylsulochrin and fumigaclavine, provided no UV-C-protective properties. Virulence tests of these three SM spore mutants indicated a slight increase in virulence of the monomethylsulochrin deletion strain. Taken together, this work suggests differential roles of specific spore metabolites acrossAspergillusisolates and by types of environmental stress. Recent revitalization of the interest in human outer space explorations has brought attention to the question of whether and how microbes, particularly pathogenic microbes, respond and adapt to space conditions (1–4). Being ubiquitous in the environment and isolated from a variety of extreme and built environments, fungi are compelling microorganisms to evaluate such adaptive responses (5–9). Further, fungal presence aboard spacecraft, including the International Space Station (ISS), has been documented (10–12). Of concern is the occurrence of potential human pathogens, such asAspergillus fumigatus, the causal agent of invasive aspergillosis, in the ISS (1). UV radiation is known to be enhanced in spacecraft and stations (13). UV may be detrimental to living organisms since it causes DNA damage and induces mutations in both direct and indirect ways by forming pyrimidine dimers and inducing oxidative stress via the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), respectively (14,15). Among three wave bands, UV-A (320 to 400 nm), UV-B (290 to 320 nm), and UV-C (100 to 290 nm), UV-C is known for its germicidal properties and is used as a sanitizing agent (14,16,17). In order to protect from damaging UV exposure, fungi have developed various defense mechanisms, including enzymes degrading ROS, DNA repair mechanisms like photoreactivation and nucleotide excision repair, and the production of UV-protective compounds like melanins and other secondary metabolites (SMs) (18). Fungi produce a diverse variety of SMs that can protect a fungus from harmful environmental factors or from competing microorganisms (19). Several studies have correlated increased conidial melanin content with UV protection in highly irradiated areas, including Chernobyl Power Plant accident sites, the ISS, and “Evolution Canyon” (20–22). Further, albino mutants have been shown to have less fitness in the field, presumably due to the loss of melanin (23). In addition to protecting fungi from UV radiation, fungal melanins are potent virulence factors in both human-pathogenic (e.g.,Cryptococcus neoformans[24],Fonsecaea pedrosoi[25], andA. fumigatus[26]) and plant-pathogenic (e.g.,Venturia inaequalis[27] andVerticillium dahliae[28]) fungi. TheA. fumigatusconidial melanin, 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN)-melanin, thwarts immune cell attack through various mechanisms, including masking of fungal pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and sequestration of signaling molecules such as calcium (29,30). However, it is unknown if this pigment provides protection toA. fumigatusfrom UV radiation. The findings that two ISS-isolated strains ofA. fumigatusshowed increased virulence in a zebrafish model of invasive aspergillosis (IA) (1) and also presented an increase in proteins associated with SM biosynthesis, including trypacidin, Asp-hemolysin, and melanin (3), compared to clinical strains CEA10 and Af293, suggested a possible correlation between conidium-associated SMs, UV-C sensitivity, and virulence. Loss ofakuleads to enhanced UV-C sensitivity but has no effect on secondary metabolite production. Three control strains, namely, Af293, an ΔakuAmutant, and a ΔakuA -mlucmutant, were examined to demonstrate the impact of the disruption ofakuAin UV-C response. This deletion allows for homologous recombination and thus creates a fungus that is easy to genetically manipulate and allows for faster creation of specific mutant strains (33). However, AkuA is involved in DNA repair (34) and would be expected to show enhanced sensitivity to UV treatment. The disruption ofakuAsignificantly decreased the survival rate, at 90%, in contrast to 60% decrease in survival of wild-type (WT) Af293 upon UV-C exposure (Fig. 1A); however, there were no differences in UV-C sensitivity between the ΔakuAmutant and the ΔakuA mlucstrain (35), which was also used for gene deletion studies (seeTable S1in the supplemental material). Despite an increase in sensitivity to UV-C, the ΔakuAmutant strains still demonstrated a dose response to increasing UV-C and thus were deemed suitable for this study. There were no differences in SM profiles between the WT Af293, ΔakuAmutant, and ΔakuA -mlucmutant strains (Fig. 1B).

DHN-melanin role in virulence in threeA. fumigatusisolates does not correlate with its role in UV-C protection. Considering the differential role of DHN-melanin in shielding the three strains from UV-C damage (Fig. 2and3), the known role of DHN-melanin in the virulence of someA. fumigatusstrains (35), and differences in virulence between Af293 and CEA10 strains (43–46), we thought it important to assess the virulence of the three ΔpksPmutants.pksPdeletion mutants were examined for changes in virulence relative to their respective WT controls using an established neutrophil-defective (rac2D57N) zebrafish model of invasive aspergillosis (46,47). Whereas both the CEA17 and IF1SW-F4 ΔpksPmutant strains were significantly decreased in virulence, the Af293 ΔpksPmutant was not (Fig. 5).

Percent survival of zebrafish upon infection with Af293 WT and theΔdmaW,ΔtpcC, andΔfmqAmutants.Pvalues were generated by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. While the radiation-protective properties of melanin in fungi have been previously documented (21,22,48,49), little is known about the UV-C-protective features of other SMs or of DHN-melanin inA. fumigatus. SinceA. fumigatusstrains have been isolated from space station environments characterized by high UV-C levels (12) and increased virulence (1), it was prudent to investigate the UV-C properties of conidial SMs and their plausible correlation with pathogenicity. Here, we found that DHN-melanin protects some but not allA. fumigatusisolates from UV-C radiation and that fumiquinazolines are UV-C protectants in WT Af293. Unexpectedly, during the study, it was noticed that the UV-C-protective property of DHN-melanin was strain dependent. Previous studies with other fungi have demonstrated the importance of DHN-melanin in UV protection (21,22,48), but an examination of melanin in different isolates within a species has not been reported, to our knowledge. Af293, CEA10, and CEA17 are commonly studied clinical strains ofA. fumigatus(33,45,55) and in IF1SW-F4, a strain previously reported as being isolated from the ISS (1). Further, DHN-melanin-deficient strain CEA17, but not strain IF1SW-F4, was more sensitive to UV-C (Fig. 3). These data suggest that there might be other metabolites which are important for tolerating the UV-C stress in IF1SW-F4. We also note that differentA. fumigatusstrains synthesize different SMs and different amounts of each SM which could contribute to differences in UV-C sensitivity (Fig. 3) (1,42). Such UV-C-protective compounds are of paramount importance during future outer space explorations, as they may be implemented to protect other organisms, including humans and plants (56). Fungal strains and growth conditions. The strains used in this study are listed inTable S1. The generated mutants were stored in 30% (vol/vol) glycerol in 0.01% (vol/vol) Tween 80 at −80°C. Strains were activated and grown at 37°C on glucose minimal medium (GMM; 6 g/liter NaNO3, 0.52 g/liter KCl, 0.52 g/liter MgSO4·7H2O, 1.52 g/liter KH2PO4, 10 g/literd-glucose, 15 g/liter agar supplemented with 1 ml/liter trace elements) for 3 days to collect and enumerate conidia in 0.01% (vol/vol) Tween 80. For UV-C exposure and secondary metabolite (SM) analysis, approximately 102conidia per plate (diameter, 10 cm) were suspended in 5 ml of GMM agar containing half of the agar concentration (top agar) and grown at 37°C for 7 days. For assessment of virulence in larval zebrafish, plates were inoculated with 1 × 106conidia of the appropriate fungal strain and incubated at 37°C for 3 days. Conidia were harvested in 0.01% (vol/vol) Tween 80 using a cell spreader and filtered through Miracloth. Conidial stocks for microinjection were resuspended in Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at a concentration of 1.5 × 108conidia/ml. To create the ΔpksPmutant in IF1SW-F4, the CRISPR-Cas9 system developed by the Mortensen lab was used (65). In brief, the IF1SW-F4 was tested for antibiotic sensitivity against hygromycin (hyg) and phleomycin (ble) to determine the selection marker and associated plasmid for targetingpksP. The strain showed sensitivity to 80 μg/ml hyg; hence, the plasmid pFC332 containing the hyg cassette was used for fungal transformation. Further, the 20-bp sequence 5′-ATC GCC AGC AAC GCC ACG CA-3′, a protospacer targetingpksP, was selected within thepksPgene and introduced to the pFC332 plasmid using the custom primers Fw1 (5′-TAG CTG TTT CCG CTG A-3′), Rev1 (5′-TGC GTG GCG TTG CTG GCG ATG ACG AGC TTA CTC GTT TCG TCC TCA CGG ACT CAT CAG ATC GCC CGG TGA TGT CTG CTC AAG-3′), Fw2 (5′-TCG TCA TCG CCA GCA ACG CCA CGC AGT TTT AGA GCT AGA AAT AGC AAG TTA A-3′), and Rev2 (5′-ATT CTG CTG TCT CGG CTG-3′). Upon this step, plasmid was propagated intoEscherichia coliDH5α, purified using the QIAprep Spin miniprep kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and used for transformation. Correct transformants were selected based on the loss of the pigment and used for downstream analyses. For gene deletion mutants, construction of the gene deletion cassette, production of protoplasts, and subsequent polyethylene glycol (PEG) transformation were performed as described previously (66). Briefly, primers (Table S3) were designed containing a 20- to 30-bp overlap were used to amplify 1,000-bp homologous regions of the gene of interest using SeqBuilder (DNAStar, Madison, WI).

UV-C exposure and survival evaluation. Secondary metabolite extraction and analysis. To examine the production of SMs of interest, agar plugs in triplicate were collected from unexposed plates. Plugs were extracted with 3 ml of methanol (MeOH) and 1:1 MeOH-DCM each, followed by 1 h of sonication. Crude extracts were evaporatedin vacuoand extracted with 3 ml of ethyl acetate (EtOAc). The EtOAc layer was evaporatedin vacuoto yield a residue suspended in 1 ml of 20% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-MeOH, and 10 μl was examined by high-performance liquid chromatography–photodiode array detection–mass spectrometry (HPLC-DAD-MS) analysis. HPLC-MS was carried out using a Thermo Finnigan LCQ Advantage ion trap mass spectrometer with a reverse-phase (RP) C18column (Alltech Prevail C18, 3 mm, 2.1 by 100 mm) at a flow rate 125 μl/min. The solvent gradient for LC-MS was 95% methyl cyanide (MeCN)-H2O (solvent B) in 5% MeCN-H2O (solvent A), both containing 0.05% formic acid, as follows: 0% solvent B from 0 to 5 min, 0% to 100% solvent B from 5 min to 35 min, 100% solvent B from 35 to 40 min, 100% to 0% solvent B from 40 to 45 min, and reequilibration with 0% solvent B from 45 to 50 min. Zebrafish care and maintenance. Adult zebrafish were reared as described previously (46). Briefly, adults were maintained on a dedicated aquatic system and subjected to a light/dark cycle of 14 h/10 h and fed twice a day. After spawning, embryos were collected in E3 buffer supplemented with methylene blue (MB) to inhibit fungal growth and incubated at 28.5°C. At 24 h postfertilization, embryos were manually decoryonated and transferred to E3 buffer lacking MB. Prior to microinjection, larvae were anesthetized in E3 buffer containing 0.2 mg/ml Tricaine (ethyl 3-aminobenzoate; Sigma-Aldrich). Larval zebrafish procedures and adult handling were performed in compliance with NIH guidelines and approved by the University of Wisconsin—Madison Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Larval zebrafish virulence assay. Virulence assays were performed using the larval zebrafish model of invasive aspergillosis, as described previously (46), with slight modifications. Neutrophil-defective larvae were obtained genetically through the use of transgenicmpx:mCherry-2A-rac2D57Nlarvae (47). Prior to infection, larvae were screened and selected for mCherry expression in neutrophils to identify individuals harboring the dominant negative allele. Briefly, hindbrain ventricle infections were performed at 48 h postfertilization using conidial stocks that were mixed 2:1 with 1% phenol red (used to visualize injection success) to a final concentration of 1 × 108conidia/ml stock. Larvae were anesthetized in E3 lacking MB and supplemented with 0.2 mg/ml Tricaine prior to microinjection of 3 nl conidia stock or PBS vehicle control into the hindbrain ventricle through the otic vesicle. Following microinjection, larvae were rinsed several times to remove the anesthetic and transferred to individual wells of a 96-well plate in ∼200 μl E3 lacking MB. The survival of individual larvae was scored daily using a loss of heartbeat as a readout of mortality. Survival analysis for larval zebrafish infection experiments was performed as previously described (46) by pooling experimental replicates and generatingPvalues by the Cox proportional hazards regression analysis.
