In host–parasite interactions, the parasite must provide offensive pressure while simultaneously keeping the host alive to sustain viable offspring [1,2]. Such conflicting goals have led to the evolution of virulence factors with diverse molecular strategies while maintaining high host specificity. Parasitic Hymenoptera make up more than a million species, are ubiquitous on the planet, and parasitize on a variety of arthropods, mainly insects [3]. Wasps attacking insect hosts have developed an assortment of behavioral and biochemical strategies for success and remain under constant co-evolutionary pressure with their hosts [4,5,6,7]. TheLeptopilina/Drosophilasystem is an emerging model for understanding the molecular foundations of anti-wasp responses and wasp virulence strategies [8]. To suppress host immunity,Leptopilinafemales introduce venom factors into their larval hosts during oviposition [4,9,10]. The well-defined innate immune mechanisms inDrosophila[11,12,13] provide a valuable context to study the effects of these wasp venom factors. Infection by the specialistL. boulardiactivates the humoral and cellular immune arms controlled by the fly’s conserved Toll-NF-κB signaling pathway. The expression of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes such asdrosomycinis activated afterL. boulardiinfection [14]. Toll-NF-κB signaling also controls blood cell division and development [15,16], steps that control encapsulation and death of wasp eggs [17,18]. In contrast, infection by the generalistL. heterotomasuppresses both immune pathways [9,14], and almost all larval blood cells are destroyed by factors in the wasp venom [19,20]. In this study, we analyze the theoretical structure of anL. heterotomapeptide, called LhKNOT, identified within organelle-like secretions in theL. heterotomavenom but not inL. boulardivenom [21]. These immune-suppressive organelles include more than 350 proteins and possess a proteomic profile of eukaryotic microvesicles and a plethora of immunity-related proteins [21,22,23]. LhKNOT adopts the “Inhibitor Cysteine Knot” (knottin) motif [24]. The knottin motif is broadly conserved in a range of taxa, from plants [25,26] to snails [27]. These small peptides (<60 residues) are functionally diverse. Knottins are used offensively, in spider toxins [28] and cone snail venom [27], as well as defensively, e.g., in wound healing activities of cacti [26], and antimicrobial host defense in plants [25,26,29] and invertebrates [30]. The broad range of knottin activity is attributed to the overall structure of its fold, which relies solely on a conserved motif of six cysteine residues that takes advantage of these cysteines’ unique ability to form disulfide bridges. The knottin motif occurs when cysteine residues are observed in a C1-C2-C3-C4-C5-C6 pattern (where “-“ represents a number of highly variable residues). Disulfide bridges are then formed in a similarly conserved fashion (C1-C4, C2-C5, and C3-C6), resulting in C1-C4 and C2-C5 forming a macrocycle, while C3-C6 occurs within this macrocycle, resulting in a “knotted” topology. As this knotted topology largely hinges on the conservation of the six cysteine residues, the knottin motif allows for significant variation in the overall sequence [30]. The combination of their small size, high tolerance of sequence variance, and observed structural stability has made knottins a popular scaffold for drug design [30], potentially even for cancer treatments [31]. Various lines of experimental evidence demonstrate or suggest antimicrobial capabilities for different knottins [25,26,29,30,32,33] or gated ion channel interactions [28,34], although the molecular mechanisms by which these functions are carried out are not well understood. Furthermore, it is not known if these antimicrobial functions share a common mechanism of action. Given its discovery from immune-suppressive particles from fly parasites, our goals were to (a) identify LhKNOT-related sequences from diverse organisms, includingL. heterotoma,L. boulardi, andGanaspisparasitoids, that attackDrosophilaand (b) identify any novel structural motif(s) present in the known or new LhKNOT homologs with the hope that the prediction of such a conserved motif might suggest possible functions for LhKNOT and guide future experimental research. We show that a theoretical model of LhKNOT possesses the hallmarks of the knottin fold with three antiparallel beta sheets, constrained by disulfide bridges. The LhKNOT model contains a CPC clip, capable of interacting with heparin, a negatively charged glycosaminoglycan (GAG) of significant medical value. LhKNOT also has the potential for interacting with other GAGs, such as keratan sulfate (a GAG that is highly sulfated, similar to heparin) and hyaluronic acid (the single GAG representative that does not require sulfation) [35]. Furthermore, structural homologs of LhKNOT (i.e., bona fide knottin motif proteins) also possess the CPC clip motif that can dock with heparin. Surprisingly, like LhKNOT and these other bona fide knottin proteins, even theDrosophilaDrosomycin antifungal peptide shares this CPC clip motif in its structure. This motif was also identified in 41 out of 46 additional LhKNOT homologs fromL. heterotoma,L. boulardi, andGanaspisspp. wasps successfully onD. melanogaster. These in silico-based observations suggest that the CPC clip motif, inherent in many knottins, may provide the structural basis for modifying immune or virulence functions. We speculate on a possible antimicrobial or virulence-related function for the wasp LhKNOT. The abundance of the knottin fold and its concurrence with the CPC clip motif in most of the newly identified knottin peptides from threeDrosophilaparasitoids suggests an important yet to be determined role for them in parasitoid physiology and/or in the host–parasite interactions. 2.1.

LhKNOT Shows the Presence of a CPC Clip, Capable of Interacting with Heparin and Other GAGs (A) Visualization of the CPC clip motif in LhKNOT. Hydrogen bonds between heparin (teal) and participating residues (Arg1, Ser3, Arg14) of LhKNOT (green) are indicated by dashed yellow lines.

In Silico Mutational Analysis of LhKNOT CPC Clip Reveals a Secondary CPC Clip 2.6. A CPC Clip Is Also Present in the Antimicrobial Peptide Drosomycin (A) Superposition of LhKNOT (blue), wound-healing peptide ofPereskia bleo(tan; pB1;cactus; PDB: 5XBD) and Drosomycin (green; Drosomycin; fly; PDB: 1MYN). (B) Distances measured in PyMOL between the centers of mass of participating residues (grey pseudo-atoms) in the Drosomycin–heparin interaction. Distances fall within 2Å of the value ranges of the CPC clip motif. (C) Surface electrostatics of Drosomycin (fly; PDB: 1MYN), showing the positively charged binding surface formed by the CPC clip where heparin is docked. The surface electrostatic potentials are color-graded from −4 kT/e (red) to +4 kT/e (blue). Analysis of a knottin wound-healing peptide bleogen pB1 from the leafy cactusPereskia bleoinitially revealed the presence of a CPC clip, a conserved structural signature of heparin-binding proteins [42]. It has immunity- and signaling-related functions in wound healing and cancer and is used as an anticoagulant [51]. GAGs are present on animal cell surfaces and have become an increasingly popular target of studies ranging from clinical to cosmetic [52]. The CPC clip motif of heparin-binding proteins is considered to be the minimum required motif for heparin-binding affinity and is defined by specific spatial relationships between three residues, two cationic (Arg/Lys) and one polar (Asn, Gln, Ser, Thr, Tyr). This CPC clip motif is defined by distances between both the α carbons of the involved residues as well as the distances between the centers of mass of the involved residues. Heparin-binding proteins are known to interact promiscuously with other negatively charged substrates, most notably the surface membranes of microbes [41]. As a result, heparin-binding proteins can exhibit antimicrobial activity to varying degrees [53]. While the precise mechanisms of this antimicrobial potential are not well defined, it has been hypothesized that the CPC clip may facilitate these protein–microbe interactions [41]. New potential roles of heparin binding are emerging, such as in the potential therapeutic interventions for amyloidogenesis [54], so understanding the structural determinants of the CPC clip in diverse proteins may be key to delineating the mechanism of the interaction and its disruption. The discovery of a putative CPC clip motif in Drosomycin is intriguing, as it sheds light on the possible mechanism of action of this antifungal peptide and supports a possible antimicrobial function for the CPC clip motif itself. Previous studies have shown the importance of Drosomycin’s residues R6 and K38, which are part of its CPC clip motif (R6-S4-K38), for its antifungal potential; alterations of these residues reduce antifungal activity [55]. Our structural analysis of the wasp LhKNOT and its similarities withDrosophilaDrosomycin offers possible insights into theL. heterotoma’s ability to broadly suppress Toll-NF-κB pathway inD. melanogasterand yet succeed on immune-compromised hosts. In the absence of a functional Toll immune pathway, and consequently without Drosomycin production,Drosophilalarvae can often succumb to opportunistic pathogens [11,13,56]. LhKNOT’s putative antimicrobial activities might defend the host from opportunistic microbial pathogens in wasp-infected, immune-compromised host larvae and developing pupae. Alternatively, similar to Drosomycin, LhKNOT could induce hemocyte apoptosis [57].L. heterotomaEVs enter hemocytes after infection [58], and their activities within EVs compromise encapsulation [19,21]. The CPC clip has been shown to associate promiscuously with GAGs [41], which are nevertheless ubiquitous in insects includingDrosophila[59]. Heparin sulfate GAGs in flies serve as growth factor receptors and participate in creating and maintaining morphogenic gradients [60]. The CPC clip has also been shown to associate promiscuously with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) [41]. Bacterial LPS, being major surface components of Gram-negative bacteria, are extremely potent stimulators of the innate immune response in various eukaryotic species including insects [61]. GAGs inDrosophilaalso control the binding of α C protein, a virulence determinant of group B streptococcus [62]. Thus, it is possible that a CPC clip containing LhKNOT and Drosomycin (and possibly other fly AMPs, such as Defensin [63]) can modulate immune signaling (and/or binding to the pathogen’s virulence proteins), similarly affecting the bacterial pathogen/metazoan parasite outcome. Previous studies have shown that three homologous knottins (Alo-1, 2, 3) from the harlequin beetleAcrocinus longimanusare active against yeast,Candida glabrata[30]. Additionally, a pore-forming candidacidal peptide,Psacotheasin, attacksCandida albicans[64]. Lastly, a plant pathogenic rust fungus,Melampsora larici-populina, produces a knottin peptide as its own candidate effector [65]. Our finding that multiple putative knottin peptides may be secreted by adult parasitoid wasps ofDrosophilawas unexpected and intriguing. While their functions are not known, the possible existence of a knottin gene family suggests some redundancy in their functions that may be linked to the parasitic life history. The exploration of the knottin structural fold in unrelated and yet-to-be discovered knottins will prove to be valuable. Our work provides a short list of residues significant to the proposed physiological activity for knottin family protein investigation. Such information can be incorporated into rational drug discovery and design for infectious diseases and related therapies. Initial scans of the NCBI non-redundant protein sequence (nr) database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein; accessed on 4 April 2018), the Transcriptome Shotgun Assembly (TSA) sequences database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/tsa; accessed on 16 April 2018) [66], and the Protein Data Bank (PDB;https://www.rcsb.org; accessed on 5 July 2018) [67] with the full-length amino acid sequence of theL. heterotomaknottin peptide (GAJC01011813.1) using NCBI BLAST (BLASTp;https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi; accessed on 16 April 2018) [68] were used to retrieve related protein sequences in other organisms. Remote homologs were searched using Position-Specific Iterative BLAST (PSI-BLAST;https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi; accessed on 4 April 2022) [69], and Hidden Markov Models (HMMER;https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/hmmer; accessed on 6 April 2022) [70,71]. BLAST searches were adjusted to word size 2, and scoring matrix BLOSUM45, while default parameters were used for HMMER. To identify knottin homologs in selectLeptopilinaandGanaspisspp. not accessible in the protein databases, targeted searches using translated BLASTs against genomic and transcriptomic datasets were employed. To identify additionalL. heterotomaknottins, theL. heterotomafemale abdominal transcriptome GAJC [72] and the whole-body transcriptomes from Ground GHUQ (GenBank Accession:GHUP00000000;TSA:Leptopilina heterotomastrainLh14, transcriptome shotgun) and Space GHUP (GenBank Accession:GHUQ00000000;TSA:Leptopilina heterotomastrainLh14, transcriptome shotgun) were searched using tblastn (e-value threshold set to 1, BLOSUM62, low complexity filter enabled, query coverage filter set to 20 percent) against LhKNOT. The following transcriptomes were similarly searched to identifyL. boulardiknottins:L. boulardifemale abdominal transcriptome GAJA [72] and the whole-body transcriptomes from Ground GITC (GenBank Accession:GITC00000000; TSA:Leptopilina boulardistrainLb17, transcriptome shotgun), Space GISX (GenBank Accession:GISX00000000; TSA:Leptopilina boulardistrainLb17, transcriptome shotgun), andGGGI00000000(female abdomen/head) [73]. In addition, targeted searches forGanaspisspp. homologs were carried out. ForG. hookeri, theGAIW00000000TSA:Ganaspisspp. G1 dataset [74] was searched (tblastn, e-value threshold set to 1, BLOSUM45, low complexity filter enabled, query coverage filter set to 20 percent) using the LhKNOT query. The Expasy tool (web.expasy.org/translate/; accessed on 9 December 2022) was used to translate these TSA sequences [75]. The resulting predicted peptide sequences were manually curated based on the presence of the cysteine motif. ForG. brasiliensis, AUGUSTUS-based (http://bioinf.uni-greifswald.de/augustus; accessed on 9 April 2020) [76] gene predictions from the partially assembled genomic sequence (Gen-Bank:GCA_009823575.1) were made using theNasonia vitripenisgenome training module. The resulting predicted proteins were searched using blastp (e-value threshold set to 1, low complexity filter enabled, query coverage filter set to 20 percent) against LhKNOT. Alignments and visualization were performed using EBI’s Clustal Omega (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo; accessed on 9 December 2022) [77] to confirm the presence of the knottin motif and for further curation of the sequences. The set of identified sequences were aligned to LhKNOT to create a multiple sequence alignment using T-COFFEE (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/tcoffee; accessed on 9 December 2022) [78] and visualized using ESPript3 (https://espript.ibcp.fr/ESPript/ESPript/index.php; accessed on 9 December 2022) [79] to identify any conserved residues and/or motif(s) in the aligned sequences. 4.2. LhKNOT Primary Structure Analysis The LhKNOT sequence was also analyzed by the domain/motif detection database Conserved Domain Database (CDD;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/cdd.shtml; accessed on 6 April 2018) and Pfam (pfam.xfam.org; accessed on 6 April 2018) to identify any domains or sequence signatures [80,81]. The sequence was further analyzed using the signal sequence prediction software SignalP-5.0 (https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/service.php?SignalP-5.0; accessed on 6 April 2018) [82] and Phobius (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/pfa/phobius; accessed on 6 April 2018) [83] to identify the location of the signal sequence and allow for a more accurate characterization of the peptide. The mature peptide of 36 amino acids (with the predicted signal sequence, residues 1–24, removed) was used for further analysis. The secondary structure of the peptide was predicted using the meta-server Sympred (https://www.ibi.vu.nl/programs/sympredwww; accessed on 6 April 2018) [84] and analyzed to confirm its correspondence to the expected secondary structure for a knottin fold: an initial alpha-helical segment (predicted signal sequence) followed by three anti-parallel beta strands. 4.3. Tertiary Structure Prediction and Evaluation of LhKNOT and Its Homologs The programs I-Tasser (https://zhanggroup.org/I-TASSER; accessed on 16 April 2018) [85], Modeller (https://salilab.org/modeller; accessed on 16 April 2018) [86], and HHPred (https://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/tools/hhpred; accessed on 6 April 2018) [37] were used to model the tertiary structure of LhKNOT. Three structural homologs with the knottin-like fold Alo-3 (PDB: 1Q3J) [30], omega-agatoxin-IVA (PDB: 1IVA) [28], and PAFP-S (PDB: 1DKC) [25] were identified as top candidates and used as templates in model building programs. The predicted model for LhKNOT was evaluated by Verify3D (https://www.doe-mbi.ucla.edu/verify3d; accessed on 18 April 2018) [39], VoroMQA (https://bioinformatics.lt/wtsam/voromqa; accessed on 18 April 2018) [40], and Prosa-web (https://prosa.services.came.sbg.ac.at/prosa.php; accessed on 18 April 2018) [38]. Evaluating small peptides with standard evaluation tools can have limitations. Thus, scores from solved tertiary structures of NMR and crystallography-derived peptides of similar size and shape (PDB: 1Q3J, 1IVA, and 1DKC) were used to interpret the evaluation scores of our LhKNOT models. The top-ranked model was created using HHPred [37], a modeling program that uses the underlying model-building program, Modeller [86] using a restraint-based comparative modeling approach. In addition, the KNOTTIN database’s KNOTER3D tool (https://www.dsimb.inserm.fr/KNOTTIN/knoter3d.php; accessed on 15 May 2020) [36] was used to evaluate the model’s tertiary structure, confirming LhKNOT’s adoption of the Knottin fold. All the identified homologs with no known structures were modeled using the top template identified in HHPred [37]. 4.4. CPC Clip Motif Identification 4.5. Association of LhKNOT with Other GAGs 4.6. Protein-Heparin Docking Analysis for Mutated CPC Clip in LhKNOT To investigate the importance of the CPC clip in heparin binding, mutated models of LhKNOT were generated using PyMOL’s mutagenesis tool, substituting the CPC clip residues with alanine. Models were created piecewise, first substituting just R14, then R1 and R14, and finally R14, R1, and S3. Heparin docking of all models was performed using ClusPro, and analysis was performed as described previously. 4.7.
