Considering the imminence of long-term space travel, it is necessary to investigate the impact of space microgravity (SPC-µG) in order to determine if this environment has consequences on the astronauts’ health, in particular, neural and cognitive functions. Neural stem cells (NSCs) are the basis for the regeneration of the central nervous system (CNS) cell populations and learning how weightlessness impacts NSCs in health and disease provides a critical tool for the potential mitigation of specific mechanisms leading to neurological disorders. In previous studies, we found that exposure to SPC-µG resulted in enhanced proliferation, a shortened cell cycle, and a larger cell diameter of NSCs compared to control cells. Here, we report the frequent occurrence of abnormal cell division (ACD) including incomplete cell division (ICD), where cytokinesis is not successfully completed, and multi-daughter cell division (MDCD) of NSCs following SPC-µG as well as secretome exposure compared to ground control (1G) NSCs. These findings provide new insights into the potential health implications of space travel and have far-reaching implications for understanding the mechanisms leading to the deleterious effects of long-term space travel as well as potential carcinogenic susceptibility. Knowledge of these mechanisms could help to develop preventive or corrective measures for successful long-term SPC-µG exposure. To determine the health risks associated with long-term space travel, it is essential to consider the effects of space microgravity (SPC-µG) on the brain. It is well-established that astronauts oftentimes experience adverse effects following a visit to outer space including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)-recognized spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS) [1]. Potential risk factors as well as limitations to lengthy space missions and stays at the International Space Station (ISS) are posed by SANS, among other difficulties that astronauts face due to the gravitational differences in space. This is particularly important because issues such as SANS can be experienced after as little as 34 days, and unusual pathologic neuro-ophthalmic findings have been shown after both short- and long-term space travel [2]. Many studies on the use of microgravity have been performed using an array of cells both committed to a specific phenotype depending on the organ of study as well as uncommitted cells known as stem cells. The origin of stem cells includes murine and human origin. Among these are adult stem cells, embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS), and organ-specific stem cells [3]. Recent publications have described changes in stem cells when exposed to simulated or space microgravity. Nonetheless, there is limited information in what concerns neural stem cells. Prior research looking at the effects of microgravity on neural stem cells has primarily been conducted with the use of simulated microgravity (sim-µG). Sim-µG studies use machines that are able to simulate low gravity conditions such as the Mitsubishi 3D-Clinostat [4]. The use of different microgravity platforms with application on stem cells and differentiated cells has recently been reviewed [3]. Only a few studies have shown the effect of sim-µG or SPC-µG specifically on neural stem cells. In this regard, Silvano and collaborators have shown that murine cerebellar neural stem cells (NSCs) respond to sim-µG by the arrest of their cell cycle in the S-phase with a concomitant increase in apoptosis. These changes occurred in a transient manner because upon return to 1G (Earth’s gravity), the authors described that the cells recovered their stemness and a normal cell cycle [5]. We have previously reported a result that appears to contradict Silvano et al.’s findings, where we found that NSCs in sim-µG proliferated more and displayed a smaller diameter than 1G grown NSCs [6]. A recent discovery that spaceflight upregulated proliferation and survival genes in neural crest derived stem cells while the random positioning machine upregulated differentiation and inflammation genes emphasized the uniqueness of space flight conditions when compared to Earth controls [7]. Our current research avoids the use of sim-µG and moves directly to the source of microgravity -- outer space. SPC-µG has demonstrated more pronounced effects of certain phenomena when compared to sim-µG [8]. Although radiation and other environmental differences cannot be excluded as contributing factors, the findings are similar between sim-µG and SPC-µG, save for the difference in degree [8]. Due to the nature of the study looking at abnormalities in cell division, it is important to understand the intricacies of the cell cycle and the potential stage(s) for error. In the case of one of the abnormalities, we deemed incomplete cell division (ICD) as failed cytokinesis. Cytokinesis is a highly complex, regulated process that requires an extensive number of cellular processes, proteins, and signaling factors to function properly. Cytokinetic failure can occur due to defects in any of its four stages, which include positioning of the division plane, ingression of the cleavage furrow, formation of the midbody, and abscission [9]. Cytokinetic failure following the division of the cell nucleus, or karyokinesis, can result in a tetraploid cell with double nuclei and four copies of each chromosome rather than the expected two. For some cells of the human body such as in the heart or liver, tetraploidy is a normal process [9]. However, in many cases, tetraploidy can be a sign of a deleterious abnormality such as a tumor precursor [10]. Previous work in the literature has confirmed that embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells behave similarly in terms of cell cycle components. Embryonic stem cell pluripotency is maintained through unique and highly specific signaling. These cells enter the S phase more rapidly with a shortened G1 due to impaired or atypical checkpoint control in embryonic stem cells and unusual activation patterns [11]. Our previous findings showed that NSCs proliferate at a higher rate while in space as well as up to 72 h following space flight, irrespective of flight duration [2,4]. We also showed that changes in the cell diameter occurred post-flight, with 81% of NSCs exhibiting a diameter of 10 µm or higher following space flight compared to 49.2% of the control NSCs [4]. While the undifferentiated NSCs in adult human brain areas such as the subventricular zone and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus remain quiescent under normal circumstances, the environment of SPC-µG exposure is likely to alter the expected behavior of these cells [12]. The changes described above including increased proliferation and enlarged cell diameter [13] could contribute to symptoms of SANS that astronauts experience post-flight such as intracranial hypertension. Here, in addition to the aforementioned differences, we noticed that some SPC-µG NSCs appeared to have difficulties with the completion of cytokinesis with enough frequency to be of interest for further investigation. The current study takes a closer look at proliferation abnormalities in single cell division. Throughout this paper, the term ICD refers to an ultimate failure of cytokinesis, regardless of whether karyokinesis has occurred, and multi-daughter cell division (MDCD) refers to the appearance of more than two daughter cells as would be typical for a single cell division following cytokinesis. The term abnormal cell division (ACD) refers to either phenomena, ICD and/or MDCD. We investigated the hypothesis that, compared to 1G NSCs, there are significantly increased instances of ICD, MDCD, and ACD following exposure to SPC-µG. We also hypothesized that the space-produced secretome would have a similar effect on naïve NSCs. 2.1. Time-Lapse Microscopy Analysis 2.1.1. A Subpopulation of NSCs Back from Space Displayed Incomplete Divisions An example from time-lapse microscopy of SPC-NSCs 1 week (A–F) and 2 weeks after space flight. One week after returning to Earth, the cells had completely recovered from their round trip to space. They were healthy, displaying cell processes, and were proliferative. (A) Nonetheless, a subpopulation appeared to have acquired a larger size (arrow) when observed under phase-contrast microscopy. (B) When time-lapse images were examined, we found that some cells had started the proliferation process (i.e., the cells appeared to be dividing (arrows)). (C,D) The cell appeared to have reached the full division process. (E) Instead of two daughter cells, they had fused together, (F) remaining that way for the rest of the time the cells were imaged. This event lasted 2.5 h (arrowheads show the cells of interest). (G,H), another example of NSCs two weeks post-flight exhibiting ICD occurring at 102.25 h into time-lapse (shown in part H) and no visible cytokinesis, with the NSC returning to one cell by 105.25 h (shown in partI). Cell(s) of interest are indicated by the yellow arrow(s). The cells finally merged and remained that way until the end of the experiment. Scale bar = 50 µm. (J) Quantitative data showing that more instances of ICDs were seen in the SPC-exposed NSCs. The average number of cells that exhibited ICD during the 50 h that NSCs were under observation via time-lapse microscopy. The purple bar denotes ground control (1G) NSCs. The green bar represents SPC-NSCs one week after returning from the ISS. The orange bar denotes NSCs two weeks after space flight. Data analysis was performed with one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey multiple comparisons test in which *p< 0.05 was defined as statistically significant; and the Chi-square test (for percentages) demonstrated statistically significant differences (p= 0.045). Data represent the mean of four separate scenes for all three conditions of NSCs shown. (K) This chart represents the average percentage of incomplete division across groups where normal NSCs that remained on Earth and NSCs one week after returning from space did show very similar cell numbers and the same percentage, while two weeks after space flight, the number of ICD cases accounted for 58%. 2.1.2. A Subpopulation of SPC-NSCs Displayed Multi-Daughter Cell Divisions 2.2. Effects of the Secretome on Naïve NSCs Cell Divisions From these data, it is clear that there were statistically significant differences in the amount of ACD as well as ICD alone following cellular exposure to SPC-µG, particularly when looking at NSCs two weeks following SPC-µG exposure. While not always statistically significant, there are also more instances of both ICD and ACD following the addition of secretome to the NSCs. Immunocytochemistry was performed on both the control and experimental groups of NSCs. These cells were examined for the expression of NSC markers in order to confirm lineage. The normal morphology and physiology of NSCs are partially dependent on the cytoskeleton, which is composed of intermediate filaments, actin, and microtubules. Representative views displaying the immunocytochemical distribution of nestin (red) and tubulin beta II (green). (A) Nestin expression in the 1G control NSCs is positive, with nuclei clearly visible. (B) Tubulin expression in 1G NSCs is also positive. (C) SPC–µG exposed NSCs intensely expressed nestin in most cells. (D) Tubulin was faintly expressed in some SPC–µG exposed NSCs but most cells were negative. Although our NSCs were not tumor derived, it is possible that NSCs in space display this novel vulnerability that might be triggered and/or enhanced to increase the frequency of abnormal cell division as a function of time. This phenomenon is similar to the progression of a benign tumor into a malignant tumor, and it could be lethal, endangering the space mission. Since our study was performed on Earth’s gravity, where naïve NSCs were not exposed to the mechanical changes between microgravity and 1G, we believe that the secretome produced by SPC-NSCs holds the key for the modulation or downregulation of the abnormal cellular behaviors ICD and MDCD observed. Having previously seen enhanced proliferation and hypertrophy [8], and in the current study hyperplasia, in our NSCs post-flight, it is easy to speculate that SPARC under different gravity conditions such as on Mars or our Moon will be differentially regulated according to the G-force the cells are subjected to. Therefore, modulation of SPARC’s gene expression may lead us to harness the countermeasures necessary to protect the CNS of the astronauts from neurodegeneration and cancer during and after space flight. These attributes, together with the increase in abnormal cell division, most likely contribute to SANS and other health complications during or following space flight. Stem cells are unique in that they are the only human cell type with the ability to self-renew and produce an unlimited quantity of daughter cells [19]. Therefore, any errors during cell division can lead to the promotion of cancer. Endogenous damage to DNA as well as pathological and environmental factors can lead to such cancer-promoting errors. Chemical and physical signals acting upon stem cells can impact the life and death of the cell as well as their differentiation process. Therefore, the risk of cancer is heavily influenced by extrinsic factors known as the ‘stem cell environment’ or niche [19,20]. As opposed to directly altering DNA, non-genotoxic agents are able to increase the risk of cancer through increasing cell proliferation [21]. The changes observed during cell division noted in this paper have features of malignant stem cells, mimicking the carcinogenic changes hypothesized to lead to cancers [22]. It is known that non-conventional mitosis events lead to tumor progression. Mechanosensing is important for proper cell physiology and tissue homeostasis. Here, we propose that SPARC is a gravity-sensor or gravitometer protein secreted by NSCs in response to an environmental change that is gravity (G). Thus, SPARC’s upregulation by microgravity serves as a marker for us to start designing strategies to regulate this gene, hence regulate proliferation and other cues altered by µG. A factor not studied in our cells was space radiation, which may also play a role in these changes and more work is needed to ascertain its net contribution to potential brain cancer produced by space missions. Aneuploidy, which is defined as the loss or gain of one or more chromosomes from a diploid gene, is a sign of genomic instability in human cancer cells. Aneuploidy likely represents an early significant event in tumorigenesis [29]. With the current resources, we could not tell if the result of the ACDs could be affecting the cells at a chromosomal level. Therefore, future research could aid the analysis of these cells and the potential detriments of abnormalities in cell division. A recent study has shown that in the mouse brain, there are polyploid neurons throughout the development of the neocortex [31]. Nonetheless, it is not clear that the study followed the mice through adulthood. Exit from the cell cycle during development coincides with the differentiation of neurons that is critical for neuronal function. Maintaining a non-dividing state in neurons is critical for brain function [32,33]. When cells exit the cell cycle, they have diploid (2C) DNA content. There is evidence indicating that polyploid cells in the CNS are more prevalent than previously thought and they may be involved in the physiology and pathology of the brain, where cell cycle re-entry is widely deleterious to neurons. To date, the function of mononucleated neurons in the brain or that of binucleated neurons in the autonomic nervous system is not known [34]. It has been hypothesized that these neurons are involved in cell cycle re-entry and neurodegeneration, and neurons entering the cell cycle as well as bi-nucleated neurons have also been reported in Alzheimer’s disease [35,36,37]. Therefore, space-based studies will help humans on Earth and astronauts during and after space missions, as summarized in a recent review [38]. Finally, the literature shows that analysis of the mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-secretome promotes both NSCs commitment to the oligodendroglial lineage, differentiation, and myelin formation and differentiation of neural stem cells in vivo. The secreted protein tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase type 1 (TIMP-1) was revealed to be an active component of the MSC-conditioned medium. Nonetheless, this work was performed in 1G, not in microgravity. Moreover, it induced cell commitment and lineage progression, which has nothing to do with abnormal cell division. It is likely that a vast array of small molecules and proteins including cytokines and other factors are secreted by NSCs on Earth. However, characterization of those factors produced and secreted by NSCs is still in its infancy. Thus far, only three factors (PGE2, TGF-β1, and TGF-β2) have been unequivocally identified. Others are still awaiting identification [39]. For this reason, we did not want to speculate further on the nature of possible molecules that might be responsible for the abnormal cell division we report in this manuscript. To our knowledge, we are the first group studying the effects of the secretome produced in space by hiPS derived NSCs. Analysis of the NSCs-produced secretome is currently being performed and we hope to report the data in the near future. NSCs were seeded on floating mesh carriers that promote strong cell adhesion. Four cell carriers of 2 × 2 mm were placed in each well pre-launch. Cells flew onboard Space X-16, spent a total of 39.6 days in space at the ISS, 248 m (400 km) above the Earth’s surface. Cells were transferred to Long Beach (CA, USA) Airport after splashdown and brought to the UCLA laboratory at 37 °C. Upon arrival, cells were seeded into flasks or flaskettes and allowed to recover for six hours in the incubator and subsequently placed in the imaging system (Adapted from Shaka et al., 2021 [13]). An elaboration upon the specific types of abnormal cell division we defined for the scope of this project. The numbers of abnormally dividing cells were counted by hand through the use of Zeiss ZEN Blue Microscopy software 2020. 4.2. Secretome Collection and Naïve NSC Cell Treatment The conditioned medium secreted by space-flown cells, otherwise known as secretome, was collected from the cell chambers separately from the cells. The samples were placed in numbered tubes and subsequently frozen at −80 °C. Environmental parameters and the experimental timeline for the 1G NSCs were based on that of the ISS in order to simulate the conditions of the space flight. Upon its recovery, we mixed two parts of culture medium per one part of straight secretome to treat naïve NSCs grown in 1G cells. The secretome was used straight (as it was obtained from the devices); no concentration was necessary to see the effects shown in this paper. The 1G naïve sister cells of the space-flown cells were first imaged with basal stem cell medium. The medium was switched to fresh medium containing secretome at 44.5 h into the time-lapse video. 4.3. Time-Lapse Microscopy Analysis 4.4.
