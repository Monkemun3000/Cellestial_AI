Living longer without simultaneously extending years spent in good health (“health span”) is an increasing societal burden, demanding new therapeutic strategies. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) can correct disease-related mitochondrial metabolic deficiencies, and supraphysiological H2S concentrations can pro health span. However, the efficacy and mechanisms of mitochondrion-targeted sulfide delivery molecules (mtH2S) administered across the adult life course are unknown. Using aCaenorhabditis elegansaging model, we compared untargeted H2S (NaGYY4137, 100 µM and 100 nM) and mtH2S (AP39, 100 nM) donor effects on life span, neuromuscular health span, and mitochondrial integrity. H2S donors were administered from birth or in young/middle-aged animals (day 0, 2, or 4 postadulthood). RNAi pharmacogenetic interventions and transcriptomics/network analysis explored molecular events governing mtH2S donor-mediated health span. Developmentally administered mtH2S (100 nM) improved life/health span vs. equivalent untargeted H2S doses. mtH2S preserved aging mitochondrial structure, content (citrate synthase activity) and neuromuscular strength. Knockdown of H2S metabolism enzymes and FoxO/daf-16prevented the positive health span effects of mtH2S, whereas DCAF11/wdr-23– Nrf2/skn-1oxidative stress protection pathways were dispensable. Health span, but not life span, increased with all adult-onset mtH2S treatments. Adult mtH2S treatment also rejuvenated aging transcriptomes by minimizing expression declines of mitochondria and cytoskeletal components, and peroxisome metabolism hub components, under mechanistic control by theelt-6/elt-3transcription factor circuit. H2S health span extension likely acts at the mitochondrial level, the mechanisms of which dissociate from life span across adult vs. developmental treatment timings. The small mtH2S doses required for health span extension, combined with efficacy in adult animals, suggest mtH2S is a potential healthy aging therapeutic. Medical advances mean humans are living longer but are also spending longer in a frail “poor health” state (1,2), with large burdens on healthcare systems and quality of life (3). Since most age-related healthcare costs and patient frailty occur in the later years of life (1,2), interventions that increase life span without simultaneously increasing health span would be detrimental to the aging process. Studies often report life span–extending therapeutics in lower organisms (4,5), but a significant caveat is the general assumption that increasing longevity also prolongs the duration spent in a healthy state (termed “health span”). While it is largely unknown whether most conditions that extend life span also increase health span, evidence indicates dissociation between the two (6). For example, all long-livedCaenorhabditis elegansmutants examined to date spend a longer time in an aged frail condition (7); the same phenomenon reported in long-living humans (1,2). Therapeutic approaches that extend healthy years, rather than life span alone, thus hold considerable socioeconomic potential. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) was one of the essential ingredients required for life to emerge on Earth (8,9) and has emerged as an important, physiologically relevant signaling molecule. When applied exogenously, H2S treatments, usually in the form of crude impure sulfide salts at supraphysiological concentrations (e.g. >100 µM), confer cytoprotective properties across various pathophysiological states (9–14), including age-associated diseases (15,16). Accordingly, 100 to 150 µM concentrations of untargeted H2S donors such as GYY4137 and FW1256 extend both life span (17–19) and health span (20) inC. eleganswhen administered from birth. However, several essential biochemical processes are established during development that program subsequent adult behavior. For example, developmental starvation cements locomotion circuitry that impacts adult foraging behavior (21), and developmentally established mitochondrial dynamics determine rates of adult respiration and aging (22). Additionally, life-extending mitochondrial interventions inC. eleganscurrently require administration on or before the developmental larval stages (23). Metabolic patterns set during developmental H2S treatments might, therefore, mediate life span and health span extension. The efficacy of H2S administered during “normal” stochastic aging thus warrants investigation to understand the viability of adult H2S-based therapies. Several cellular processes are responsive to H2S that can regulate H2S-mediated longevity (18), yet the mechanisms governing H2S-mediated health span are undefined. Increasing evidence supports a mitochondrion-centric mode of H2S action across cell types and pathologies. Current dogma suggests H2S donates electrons to the mitochondrial electron transport chain, inhibits mitochondrial cAMP phosphodiesterases, facilitates mitochondrial DNA repair, promotes mitochondrial antioxidant protection, and augments mitochondrial respiration/ATP production (reviewed in ref.24). Moreover, mitochondrial loss is one of the nine hallmarks of aging (25) and is the earliest detectable subcellular structural change duringC. elegansaging (26), preceding physiological decline (27). As such, therapies that exploit positive H2S effects on mitochondria represent an attractive antiaging strategy. The mitochondrial sulfide delivery molecule (mtH2S), AP39, exploits mitochondrial membrane potential by utilizing a TPP+motif to localize H2S to the mitochondria and protect against cellular injury [e.g., glucose oxidase–induced mitochondrial dysfunction (28)] vs. equal doses of untargeted H2S donors. Consequently, unlike untargeted H2S compounds (e.g., GYY4137, FW1256) with supraphysiological effective doses (17–20), mtH2S displays potency at concentrations several orders of magnitude lower inC. elegansdisease models (13,14). Whether such phenomena occur in the aging context is unknown; however, mtH2S is plausibly responsible for longevity and health span extension reported following larger untargeted H2S doses. This study, therefore, investigated the efficacy of a mtH2S (AP39) for promoting health span via mitochondrion-mediated effects vs. untargeted H2S donors, usingC. elegansas an aging model. Given the unknown capacity of H2S as an efficacious therapy in aging adults, we also examined health span effects of adult-onset H2S treatments. Using functional pharmacogenetic approaches, we provide evidence that mtH2S is a requirement for, and site of action of, H2S-mediated health span promotion. Importantly, mtH2S increases health span when administered to young and middle-aged adults, and this adult treatment effect is clearly reflected at the transcriptomic level compared to developmental mtH2S administration, under the control of a GATA family of transcription factors. These findings strongly suggest that augmentation of mitochondrial sulfide may represent a druggable target and translatable therapeutic approach to maintaining health with advancing age, at time points where the negative effects of aging already manifest. mtH2S IncreasesC. elegansLife span and Neuromuscular Health span. We first investigated the effects of mitochondrion-targeted and nontargeted H2S donors onC. eleganslife span. Dosing L1 larvae with the untargeted sulfide donor NaGYY4137 (100 µM) increased maximal life span by 20 % (P< 0.0001) (Fig. 1A), which is comparable to previous studies using GYY4137 (morpholine salt) and related compounds (18,19). In sharp contrast, the mitochondrion-targeted sulfide delivery molecule (mtH2S) AP39 significantly increased life span at 1000-fold lower doses (100 nM) by 30% (P< 0.0001) (Fig. 1B), whereas equivalent 100 nM doses of untargeted NaGYY4137 had no significant effect onC. eleganslife span extension (Fig. 1A). Lower doses of mitochondrion-targeted H2S extend life span. (A)C. eleganslife span is significantly increased with higher (100 µM), but not lower (100 nM) treatment with the untargeted H2S donor, NaGYY4137 when administered from L1 larval stage across the entire lifecourse. (B) Conversely, lower doses (100 nM) of mitochondrion-targeted H2S (AP39) extend life span. Life span curves represent the average of three biological replicates (total ~300 to 600 animals per condition). **** denotes significant difference vs. untreated (0.01% DMSO) wild-type controls (P< 0.0001). ns, nonsignificant. We next assessed movement rates on days 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 of life span as a robust proxy of overall animal health (29–31) and, therefore, health span. Using wMicroTracker to measure prolonged movement capacity beyond standard thrash assays (32), wild-type movement capacity peaked at day 4 of adulthood (+97% vs. day 0 baseline), as previously published (33,34), and progressively declined thereafter to a nadir of −26% at day 16 (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). At greatly different doses, 100 µM NaGYY4137 H2S and 100 nM mtH2S increased total animal movement rates across the life course (P< 0.001), using area under the curve analysis of movement across the life course, as previously published (30) (Fig. 2A). Post hoc analysis showed significant health span extension in mtH2S (100 nM)-treated animals up to day 16 postadulthood compared to day 12 postadulthood during NaGYY4137 treatments (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). Loss of neuromuscular strength is also one of the strongest correlates of all-cause mortality in humans (29,35), leading us to employ our “NemaFlex” device (36–38) to examine neuromuscular strength changes across age. As with movement rates (SI Appendix, Fig. S1), wild-type strength capacity increased between days 0 and 4 adulthood and declined thereafter. Conversely, treatment with mtH2S (100 nM) improved strength production across days 0–10 postadulthood (P< 0.001), with a significant 20% strength increase vs. wild-type at day 10 (Fig. 2B). Additionally, while the observed effect sizes of mtH2S are comparable to those reported for other life span–extending compounds (39–41), the improvements we observed are modest. We, therefore, directly compared mtH2S to a recently published life span and health span improving drug, rilmenidine (42), using our microfluidic “Nemalife” health span device, and found both compounds extended life span and health span to similar degrees using our microfluidic approach (SI Appendix, Fig. S2). Rilmendine also has no effect on neuromuscular health parameters in early life (42) but rather manifest in older age time points, as observed herein for mtH2S. Collectively, these data strongly suggest that H2S effects on health span are likely mediated through mitochondrial effects which, although modest, may be highly beneficial, since aging is also associated with a later life loss of prolonged movement and strength-producing capacity. Mitochondrion-targeted H2S extends movement rate and maximal strength indices of health span. (A) Animal movement rate is increased across the entire lifecourse with both lower dose (100 nM) mitochondrion-targeted H2S (AP39) and higher dose (100 µM) untargeted H2S (NaGYY4137) when administered from L1 larval stage until death. Movement rates as a % change from day 0 baselines, across days 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 postadulthood, are presented as area under the curve. (B) Lower dose (100 nM) mitochondrion-targeted H2S maintainsC. elegansmaximal strength producing ability in later life (day 10 postadulthood), measured using our microfluidic NemaFlex device. Data presented are mean ± SD, n = 90 per condition, across 3 biological replicates. *P< 0.05, **P< 0.01 and ****P< 0.0001 denotes significant difference vs. untreated (0.01% DMSO) wild-type controls. mtH2S Maintains Mitochondrial Structure and Content. Given the well-established role of mitochondrial dysfunction in age-related health decline across species (25), we examined whether mtH2S health span promotion associated with maintained mitochondrial integrity. Using green fluorescent protein-tagged mitochondrion transgenic animals to compare lower dose mtH2S (100 nM) to higher dose untargeted H2S (100 µM), mitochondrial structure was scored as either well networked, or moderately fragmented. Well-networked mitochondria at day 0 of adulthood presented in 88% of wild-type animals, which was not affected by either mtH2S or untargeted H2S treatments. In line with previous reports (26), by day 2 postadulthood well-networked mitochondria reduced to 21% in wild-type worms. The number of well-networked mitochondria increased threefold with mtH2S treatment at day 2 of adulthood, and twofold with untargeted H2S (P< 0.001). Only mtH2S significantly sustained mitochondrial integrity at day 4 postadulthood (Fig. 3A). In wild-type animals, the number of moderately fragmented mitochondria increased progressively from day 2 of adulthood (21% of animals), reaching 86% by day 16. Comparable delays in moderate mitochondrial fragmentation were observed between mtH2S and untargeted H2S from days 8 to 12 postadulthood, whereas only mtH2S supressed moderate fragmentation up to day 14 of adulthood (Fig. 3B). We also assessed citrate synthase activity (CS) as a marker of mitochondrial health, which correlates with mitochondrial content, biosynthesis, and cristae area (43). Untargeted H2S failed to induce a significant effect on CS across the life course. Conversely, mtH2S significantly increased CS throughout life span, and to a greater extent than untargeted H2S (up to day 12,P< 0.0001), with significant increases in CS presenting up to day 4, but not day 12 of life span (Fig. 3E). To confirm that differences in H2S bioavailability does not underpin the improved efficacy of mtH2S vs. untargeted H2S for maintaining mitochondrial structure and content, we assessed total animal sulfide levels and found no difference with either compound at day 4 postadulthood (SI Appendix, Fig. S3). Thus, mtH2S improves mitochondrial integrity across age, which associates with health span maintenance. mtH2S prolongs mitochondrial integrity and content. (A) The percentage of well-networked and (B) moderately fragmented mitochondria duringC. elegansaging is significantly improved with mtH2S (AP39), and for a longer duration than untargeted H2S (NaGYY4137) treatments.

AP39-Mediated Health span Extension Requires H2S Metabolism and FoxO Pathways, but Not Nrf2 Oxidative Stress Protection. Summary of mechanisms regulating mtH2S-induced life span and health span extension C. eleganswere treated with mtH2S (100 nM) from L1 larval stage in the presence or absence of RNAi against each target gene, using our microfluidic healthspan device. Each experiment was performed in duplicate (total ~160 animals per condition) and health span data expressed as area under the curve (% movement rate of each day of the lifecourse vs. day 0 baseline values). Ticks denote RNAi knockdown prevents significant (P< 0.05) mtH2S life span or health span extension and compared to untreated (0.01% DMSO) empty vector controls. Crosses denote RNAi knockdown does not prevent significant (P< 0.05) mtH2S-induced life span or health span extension. All raw data are provided inSI Appendix, Fig. S4. Adult Treatments with mtH2S Extend Health span, but Not Life span. Life span and health span extension have only been previously reported with untargeted H2S continuously administered from L1 larval stage until death. We, therefore, treated animals with low (100 nM) dose AP39 or 1000-fold higher (100 µM) dose NaGYY4137, starting in either day 0 young adults, day 2 of adulthood (chosen as the time point of mitochondrial fragmentation onset,Fig. 4Aand ref.26), or day 4 of adulthood [chosen as the time point when tissue structural integrity begins to decline (26)]. Both mtH2S and untargeted H2S donors were ineffective at increasing animal life span when administered from day 0, 2, or 4 of adulthood (P> 0.05). Conversely, health span was significantly increased by mtH2S when administered from either day 0, 2, or 4 of adulthood (P< 0.01) and was also increased with untargeted H2S treatments starting from days 2 or 4 postadulthood (P< 0.05), but not in day 0 young adults (Fig. 4andSI Appendix, Fig. S7). Additionally, mtH2S administered from day 0 adulthood significantly increased the number of normally arrayed mitochondria at days 4 and 10 postadulthood, and improved sarcomere organization at day 10 postadulthood (SI Appendix, Fig. S8). Providing further evidence that improved mitochondrial health underpins mtH2S health improvements, we also found significantly lower mitochondrial superoxide levels during aging with adult mtH2S treatment (SI Appendix, Fig. S9). Health span was thus extended when mtH2S was delivered to adult animals, at time points where key aging subcellular defects occur, and is reflected in delayed onset of age-related dystrophic muscle and dysfunctional mitochondria. Adult-onset treatment with mitochondrion-targeted H2S extends health span but not life span. (A–C) Survival curves are unaffected vs. wild-type (P> 0.05) with 100 nM mtH2S and 100 µM untargeted H2S treatments beginning at day 0, 2 or 4 of adulthood. (D–F) mtH2S significantly increases health span when administered from day 0, 2, or 4 of adulthood, and untargeted H2S improves health span when administered from day 2 or 4 postadulthood. Health span data presented movement as a % change from day 0 baselines across all time points postadulthood, analyzed as area under the curve, n = 360 per condition, across 3 biological replicates and 18 technical replicates. Life span data are ~300 animals per condition, across three biological replicates. *P< 0.05, ***P< 0.001 and ****P< 0.0001) denotes significant difference vs. untreated (0.01% DMSO) wild-type controls. Adult mtH2S Treatments Maintain Mitochondrion- and Peroxisome-Enriched Transcriptomes in Later Life. To better understand the molecules governing life span and health span responsiveness to mtH2S, we performed next-generation sequencing on animals treated with mtH2S from L1 larvae or from day 0 of adulthood. Principal component analysis revealed distinct features ofC. eleganstranscriptomes across days 0, 4, and 10 postadulthood. Moreover, mtH2S-treated animals displayed similar gene features to wild-type at day 0 and 4 of adulthood. Divergence from wild-type presented in older day 10 animals, with a shift toward day 4 features in mtH2S treatments, particularly when treated from day 0 young adulthood (Fig. 5A). Consistent with principal component analysis, global transcriptomic dysregulation at day 10 postadulthood was reduced in animals treated with mtH2S at adult onset only (Fig. 5B). Next, clustering of differentially expressed genes using expression profiles (51–53) identified four most prominent differentially expressed gene clusters (i.e., clusters containing >200 differentially expressed genes). Two of these (Clusters 8 and 14) exhibited an elevated expression profile in later life (day 10 postadulthood) that was suppressed with adult onset mtH2S but unaffected by mtH2S administered from birth (L1 stage), and were functionally associated with FoxO, proteolytic, mitophagy, and ribosome translational processes (Fig. 5CandD). Analyzing the top 10 ranked protein–protein interaction (PPI) network hub nodes for each cluster identifieddaf-2-responsive F-box genes (fbxb-41,fbxb-54,fbxb-91,M116.1,pes-2.2,T05D4.2,T25E12.6) and autophagy (C35E7.5) components as prominent cluster 8 hubs. Cluster 14 hubs aligned almost exclusively to nucleolus localized components (lpd-7,nol-6,nol-14,pro-3,rpl-24.2) involved in RNA-binding activity as part of the ribonucleoprotein complex (F49D11.10,rbm-28,toe-1,W09C5.1,Y45F10D.7). As with wider cluster expression profiles, gene expression of hub components was predominantly altered at day 10 older age and in response to adult mtH2S treatments only (Fig. 5E).

Data represent ~60 animals across biological triplicates, per condition and time point. For all panels, WT = wild-type. D0, D4 and D10 = days 0, 2 and 4 postadulthood, respectively. Moreover, two gene clusters (Clusters 3 and 13) that aligned to cytoskeletal structure, mitochondria, and general metabolism functional classes, displayed progressive expression declines with age. In both clusters, mtH2S administered from L1 again failed to affect the age-related loss of gene expression. Conversely, adult-onset mtH2S treatment induced a strong maintenance of gene expression, emerging specifically in day 10 adults (Fig. 5CandD). Additionally, this pattern of age-related gene expression changes remaining unaltered by L1 mtH2S administration, but rejuvenated by adult-onset mtH2S in later life emerged across nearly all other 27 gene clusters identified (SI Appendix, Table S1 and Fig. S10). Top ranked hubs for cluster 3 related mostly to muscle cytoskeletal proteins (C46G7.2,cpn-3,mlc-1,mup-2,tnt-2,unc-27), but included regulators of calcium homeostasis (csq-1) and glutathione transferase activity (gst-26). Within cluster 13, there was striking enrichment for hubs functionally associated with peroxisomal components (acox-1.1,acox-1.2,B0272.4,ctl-2,daf-22,dhs-28) and lysosomal cathepsin proteases (asp-1,asp-3). Again, only adult-onset mtH2S treatments appeared to attenuate the age-related reduction in gene expression of hub components, in older day 10 animals (Fig. 5E). To probe the mechanistic influence of these hub genes in the positive aging effects of adult-onset mtH2S, we examined the requirement of the peroxisomal catalasectl-2as the most strongly maintained hub gene across clusters 3, 8, 13, and 14 (Fig. 5E). RNAi knockdown ofctl-2exacerbated early adult mitochondrial fragmentation and prevented the mtH2S-induced mitochondrial maintainance in early and later life (SI Appendix, Fig. S11), therein supporting the functional and mechanistic relevance of our identified transcriptomic targets. A GATA Transcription Factor Regulatory Circuit Underpins the Positive Aging Effects of mtH2S. We next sought to examine the mechanistic role of genes responsive to mtH2S during aging; however, the clusters identified represent several dozen individual differentially expressed genes. We, therefore, employed transcription factor (TF)-binding site analysis to identify TFs predicted to commonly regulate the cytoskeletal (Cluster 3) and peroxisomal (Cluster 13) gene clusters that display mtH2S-induced preservation in older age. From this, a single transcription factor,elt-3(part of a GATA family of transcription factors), emerged as the putative regulator of both gene clusters (Fig. 5D). During wild-type aging, expression ofelt-5andelt-6increase which, in turn, repress expression ofelt-3to regulate a large portion of age-related transcriptome changes (54). Our untreated controls mirrored this response at the transcriptional level, and these expression changes are reversed by adult onset mtH2S (SI Appendix, Fig. S12). Next, using transgenic animals coexpressing ELT-6 RFP and mitochondrial GFP reporters, we confirmed protein level ELT-6 upregulation during aging, which was suppressed by adult onset mtH2S treatment (Fig. 6AandB), and corresponded with improved mitochondrial structure and movement rates (Fig. 6CandD). Additionally, knockdown of eitherelt-6orelt-3, while not affecting animal movement rate in middle age and older age, prevented mtH2S-induced movement increases (Fig. 6EandF). Adult-onset mtH2S preserves health span through the ELT-6GATA transcription factor circuit. (A) ELT-6 expression increases with aging and is significantly repressed with AP39 treatment compared to untreated animals in later-life. (B) Representative images of ELT-6expression (elt-6::mCherry). (C) Preservation of age-related declines in mitochondrial integrity by AP39 correspond with attenuated ELT-6 expression (usingelt-6::mCherry+mito::GFP coexpression reporter strain). (D) AP39-induced improvements in aging movement capacity is confirmed inelt-6::mCherry+mito::GFP animals, and correspond with lowered ELT-6 and improved mitochondrial integrity. RNAi againstelt-3(E) andelt-6(F) prevents the health span–promoting effects of AP39. PanelsA–Demployed transgenic animals coexpressingelt-6::mCherry+mito::GFP in body-wall muscle, across 25 to 45 animals and two biological repeats. Panels (EandF) employed wild-type N2 animals. Movement rates are from 80-120 animals per condition, per time point. # denote significant effect of aging compared to untreated day 0 animals (#P< 0.05;###P< 0.001). * denote significant effect of treatment for within-day comparisons against untreated animals (*P< 0.05; **P< 0.01; ***P< 0.001). To verify the role ofelt-6/elt-3, we examined the cytoskeleton (adherens junction) and mitochondrion-localized protein BAR-1/ β-catenin, loss of which is reported to upr-egulate gene clusters under regulation byelt-3(55) which would, therefore, be anticipated to also down-regulate ELT-6. Consistent with this model, we observed thatbar-1RNAi prevented age-related increases in ELT-6 expression (SI Appendix, Fig. S13). Moreover, mtH2S did not synergistically lower age-related ELT-6 levels when combined withbar-1RNAi (SI Appendix, Fig. S13), implying some functional association with mtH2S and bar-1/β-catenin (further supporting a role for mtH2S in modifiying the cytoskeleton via theelt-6/elt-3circuit). While the precise causal mechanisms linking H2S-related mitochondrial improvements with theelt-6/elt-3system and, subsequently, health span remains undefined, the mitochondrial mechanisms appear specific to the aging context; although we show aging mitochondrial decline and mtH2S acts through this TF circtuit, inducing acute severe mitochondrial decline via toxic drugs fails to activate ELT-6 despite major structural fragmentation of mitochondria (SI Appendix, Fig. S14). Combined, our systems biological studies provide evidence that mtH2S improves mitochondrial health to alterelt-6/elt-3TFs, which likely act as a reguatory circuit governing cytoskeletal and peroxisomal gene clusters to, ultimately, modify health span. H2S is a diatomic signaling molecule that promotes healthy aging inC. elegans(20), yet the underlying mechanisms and therapeutic viability across the lifecourse remains unclear. In this study, we have demonstrated that low mtH2S doses extendC. eleganshealth span, which associates with improved mitochondrial integrity from young adulthood into older age. Multiple elements of H2S metabolic pathways, and FoxO transciption factors emerged as mechanisms governing both life span and health span, whereas the Nrf2 antioxidant system is dispensible for mtH2S-induced health span extension. Adult mtH2S treatments also increase health span, predominantly in later life, and associates with rejuvenation of key features of the aging transciptome, including mitochondrial function, cytoskeletal content, and peroxisomal metabolism, which appear to be controlled by a GATA transcription factor circuit. The ability of large amounts of untargeted H2S, administered from birth, to enhanceC. eleganslife span and health span, is well documented (17–20). Our data reveal 1000-fold lower doses of a mitochondrion-targeted (TPP+-driven) H2S donor (28) can account for the life span, health span, and neuromuscular strength extension elicited by H2S. Thus, small amounts of H2S transported to the mitochondria are likely responsible for, and the site of action of, H2S effects on longevity. Temporal analysis further revealed mtH2S improved mitochondrion integrity beginning in earlier life that was maintained throughout the lifecourse, thus delaying one of the primary cellular hallmarks of aging (25). Conversely, mtH2S did not increase movement rates or muscle strength until older age, likely owing to a lack of declines in muscle strength and habitual movement capacity during early adulthood, which is unsurprising, if decreasing H2S metabolism/synthesis is an aging pathology (56). These findings closely mirror the human phenotype, where a clear biphasic pattern of muscle aging emerges that involves early disruption to metabolic processes (57,58) (as withC. elegansearly loss of mitochondria integrity), which later manifests as exponential neuromuscular strength/ physical capacity declines (again, as occurs inC. elegans) that exceeds rates of musle mass losses (59,60). As such, our data evidence that mtH2S can target the early mitochondrial metabolic perturbations during aging, possibly in preference over targeting respiratory function of existing mitochondria (61,62) that attenuates the ensuing later changes in neuromuscular performance and health (25,61,62). While the mechanisms regulating H2S-induced longevity have been explored (19), understanding the molecules governing health span is at least equally valuable, given the growing societal burden of life span – health span dissociation. Of the fourteen genes targeted for established roles in H2S biology, two clear functional themes emerged as mechanisms of mtH2S life span and health span extension. First, the FoxO/daf-16transcription factor is a highly conserved regulator of longevity across species (63) and in response to untargeted H2S (19). Our findings extend this to showdaf-16is also required for mtH2S-related health span improvements. Second, although exogenous H2S could hypothetically bypass the biochemical need for endogenous H2S synthesis, the H2S metabolism genes examined (most strikingly the mitochondria localized 3-MST/mpst-1) were required for health span extension by mtH2S. Moreover, mtH2S-induced sulfide increases were prevented bycth-2,mpst-1,orcbs-1knockdown. Thus, while perhaps counterintuitive, presence of a functional H2S production system is a requirement for efficacious mtH2S treatments and might reflect the multifaceted cellular roles of the H2S enzymatic machinery and/or the diverse downstream consequences of loss of these enzymes (64). For example, H2S likely exerts at least part of its biological effects via cysteine persulfidation of multiple protein targets (65). The mitochondrially localized 3-MST/mpst-1is also a trans-persulfidase (66), thus H2S enzyme knockdown could prevent mtH2S-mediated persulfidation events, through which H2S might partially act. Interestingly, despite fatal consqeuences of complete ETHE1 knockout in higher mammals (45), RNAi knockdown of the mitochondrial H2S catabolic enzyme ETHE1/ethe-1strongly improved health span, possibly by mimicking mtH2S through mitochondrial accumulation of noncatabolized endogenous H2S. However, combinedethe-1RNAi and mtH2S ablates health span extension, and life span becomes shortened at higher, but not lower (1 to 10 nM) mtH2S doses, potentially due to toxic mtH2S accumulation, implying tight physiological range of mtH2S hormesis. Overall, these mechanistic insights add further evidence that place mitochondria at the center of H2S-regulated health span. The potential for developmentally programmed metabolic patterns with larval H2S treatments (21–23) renders the efficacy of postadulthood H2S therapies uncertain. We establish health span alone is extended with young adult mtH2S treatments, and when initiated in the presence of existing aging tissue pathologies. We, and others (26), found that mitochondrial fragmentation begins early in life (2 days postadulthood), and in this study we report that mtH2S improves health span when administered at this time. Similarly, muscle structural and proteostasis abnormalities occur later (4 days postadulthood), and mtH2S also displays efficacy during this therapeutic window. Mitochondrial H2S is, therefore, a viable adult-onset antiaging therapeutic opportunity. Transcriptomic studies aimed at understanding the mechanisms regulating adult mtH2S health span extension revealed clear distinctions from larval treatments. Whilet administering mtH2S from L1 stage caused broad transcriptional features that diverged only slightly from wild-type animals only in older age, adult-onset mtH2S caused strong rejuvenation of the aging transcriptome toward “younger” gene profiles. Cluster analysis revealed adult mtH2S suppressed aging-induced increases in FoxO/daf-16pathway expression. Whilet contrasting our observation thatdaf-16is a required effector of larval mtH2S treatment, suppression of agingdaf-16levels with adult mtH2S implies divergent effects of FoxO induction during development vs. postdevelopment (71). This is consistent with earlier reports that longevity caused by up-regulating FoxO/daf-16(viainsulin receptor/daf-2mutation) is primarily established during larval development (72). Conversely, sarcopenia associates with postdevelopmental FoxO upregulation across species (58), corresponding with later life metabolic reprogramming to compensate for aging health decline (57,58). Consistent with a potential beneficial aging effect of reduced postadulthood FoxO expression, are the moderate health span improvements we report with mtH2S-relateddaf-16suppression. This phenomenon underscores an unexplained paradox in aging research, whereby developmentally programmed life span extension (e.g., with increased FoxO signaling) presents at the expense of health span (7). Indeed, in people, FoxO genetic variants correlate with centenarians (73), yet impaired insulin signaling/ increased FoxO induced during adulthood causes serious clinical complications (e.g., diabetes, sarcopenia). Our data support a model whereby postdevelopmental, aging-induced increases in FoxO expression are harmful to health span (71), and drug interventions such as mtH2S that lower this response improve health whilet having minimal effect on longevity. Last, adult mtH2S also caused suppression of age-related increases in mitophagy and, most prominently, ribosomal biogenesis. Thus, mtH2S might mitigate unchecked mitophagy by preventing the mitochondrial dysfunction that promotes mitophagy with age (74), and promote improved translational efficiency as previously proposed to underpin physical activity-based anti-aging regimens (75,76). Adult mtH2S treatment also better maintained later-life expression of lowered aging transcriptomic profiles. Genes clustering to mitochondrion function featured heavily, lending further support to the central role of mitochondria in mtH2S-mediated health span. Expression of muscle cytoskeletal components also decreased with age, which was minimized by adult mtH2S administration, with top ranked hub components largely represented by cytoskeletal (e.g., troponin regulation) factors. Given the later life temporal correlation between increased muscle structural genes and movement/strength capacity, mtH2S represents a promising neuromuscular health intervention in older age. Last, loss of metabolic plasticity is a common feature of aging across species (25). We found progressive reduction in expression of metabolic functional clusters across aging that was increased with adult onset mtH2S. Notably, metabolic cluster hub genes were strongly enriched for peroxisomal components. Peroxisomes are essential for proper functioning of all cell types, compartmentalizing enzymes regulating, e.g., fatty acid β-oxidation and hydrogen peroxide metabolism. Several facets of peroxisome dysfunction cause accelerated aging (77), and our data suggest peroxisome function can be sustained by mtH2S across life span. For example,dhs-28regulates age-dependent peroxisome loss, knockdown of which extendsC. eleganslife span (78), and our findings identifydhs-28as a top ranked, mtH2S-responsive hub component. Moreover, we confirm the mechanistic relevance of our identified peroxisomal transcriptomic targets by showing knockdown of thectl-2hub gene prevents mtH2S-induced health span extension. Growing evidence also highlights inextricable cross talk between peroxisome and mitochondrial function (79). Indeed, caloric restriction–induced longevity [whose mechanisms converge with those of H2S (80)], requires mitochondria structural maintenance which, in turn, promotes peroxisome fatty acid oxidation (81). Our early-life improvements in mitochondrial integrity, combined with mitochondria localizing H2S, demonstrate improvements in mitochondrial integrity precede, and perhaps regulate, later life improvements in peroxisome capacity. Additionally, the lack of mechanistic regulation of health span by the Nrf2 antioxidant system implies that improved peroxisome fatty acid oxidation, as opposed to lowered reactive oxygen species generation, underpin peroxisomal effects of mtH2S on healthy aging. In conclusion, a systems biological approach identifies the mitochondria as the primary site of H2S action for slowing aging, with distinct molecular mechanisms underpinning life span vs. health span extension. Unlike life span, increased mtH2S health span does not require activation of the Nrf2 antioxidant system. Adult-onset mtH2S also increases health span alone, which associates with unique aging transcriptomic signatures compared to life span–extending developmental mtH2S treatments, under the control ofelt-6/elt-3GATA transcription factors. The emergence of neuromuscular health improvements in later life might also be underpinned by temporally correlated, mtH2S-responsive transcriptomic features of mitochondria, peroxisomal metabolism, and cytoskeletal function. Finally, the comparably lower mtH2S donor doses (vs. nontargeted NaGYY4137; >3 orders of magnitude difference) required for aging health benefits, combined with efficacy in adult animals and high conservation of associated mechanisms, renders mtH2S a possible translational antiaging therapy. C. elegansMaintenance and Experiment Design. The strains used in this study were N2 wild-type and CB5600(ccIs4251 (Pmyo-3::Ngfp-lacZ; Pmyo-3::Mtgfp))and were obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Centre (CGC, University of Minnesota). For maintenance,C. eleganswere cultured at 20 °C on OP50E. coliseeded NGM agar plates, as previously described (82). For all experiments, the first day of adulthood was considered as Day 0. For drug exposure experiments, unless stated otherwise, L1 worms synchronized by gravity floatation were cultured at 20 °C on OP50E. coliseeded NGM plates containing either 100 nM AP39 + 0.01% DMSO, 100 nM or 100 mM NaGYY4137, 0.01% DMSO or no drug. The mitochondrion-targeted H2S donor compound, AP39, was synthesized in-house by the Whiteman lab, as previously described (83,84). The NaGYY4137 (85) untargeted H2S donor compound was also synthesized in-house. Compound solutions were freshly prepared for every use and added to plates the evening before animal transfers. For developmental treatments, drug dosing was started from the L1 larval stage and continued throughout the life course. For adult drug treatments, gravity synchronized L1 larvae were grown on NGM agar seeded with OP50 only for 60 h to reach young adulthood, after which drug treatments were started at either day 0, day 2, or day 4 postadulthood. Adult animals were transferred every 48 h to fresh plates to remove progeny and maintain consistent food and drug concentrations. Survival Assay and Measures ofC. elegansLocomotion and Maximal Strength Production. Mitochondrial and Myofibrillar Imaging. Mitochondria within body wall muscle cells of the CB5600 (ccIs4251(Pmyo-3::Ngfp-lacZ; Pmyo-3::Mtgfp)) strain were imaged using an Olympus CKX41 microscope (Olympus UK Ltd. London). The worms were imaged by GFP fluorescence microscopy at 40× magnification. Approximately 20 to 30 animals per condition were placed in 20 µL M9 on a microscope slide and immobilized with a cover slip. Images were taken of myofibers or mitochondria in body-wall muscle from both head and tail regions of every animal and visually classified as either well-networked, moderately fragmented, or severely fragmented (for mitochondrial quantification), or organized, moderately disorganized, and severely disorganized (for myofibrillar quantification) as previously described (26,86). The overall proportion of mitochondrial or myofibrillar classifications was obtained by normalizing to the total muscle cell count within each treatment condition (~150 to 300 muscle cells per condition from 30 to 60 animals per time point) across two biological replicates. Measurement of Citrate Synthase Activity. RNA Isolation for Next-Generation Sequencing. 7-azido-4-Methylcoumarin Measures of Total Sulfide Levels. ELT-6 Fluorescent Reporter Quantification. Mitochondrial Toxic Stress Assays in ELT-6 Transgenic Reporter Animals. Age-synchronized SD1550 animals were grown to young adulthood on 33-mm NGM plates seeded with OP50 bacteria. Approximately 30 day 0 adults where then picked into 40 μL of either 100 μM hydrogen peroxide (Sigma, UK; 7722-84-1) or 5 mM sodium arsenite (Santa Cruz, DE; 7784-46-5) diluted in M9 for 1- and 2-h exposures, respectively. For rotenone and antimycin A exposures, animals were picked into 40 μL 50 μM or 100 μM concentrations, respectively, diluted in 20 mg/mL OP50/NGM bacteria and incubated for 4 h. Tubes where then washed three times with M9 before animals were pipetted onto slides and immobilized by a coverslip. Both ELT-6 and mitochondrial images were then captured and analyzed as detailed above. Mitochondrial Superoxide Assessment. Statistics and graph generation were performed in GraphPad Prism 9. Significance was determined by pairedttest or 2-way ANOVA, with post hoc multiple comparison tests. For survival analyses, the Log-Rank (Mantel Cox) test was used.
