Recent studies have provided insights into the persistence and succession of microbes aboard the International Space Station (ISS), notably the dominance ofKlebsiella pneumoniae. However, the interactions between the various microbes aboard the ISS and how they shape the microbiome remain to be clearly understood. In this study, we apply a computational approach to predict possible metabolic interactions in the ISS microbiome and shed further light on its organization. Our study underscores the importance ofK. pneumoniaein the ISS, and its potential positive and negative interactions with other microbes, including potential pathogens. This integrated modeling approach, combined with experiments, demonstrates the potential for understanding the organization of other such microbiomes, unravelling key organisms and their interdependencies. Microorganisms are ubiquitous and exist in diverse communities around us. They form complex dynamic assemblages in every ecosystem, and their interactions shape the biotic and abiotic environments [1–3]. Beyond natural environments such as the soil or the ocean, microorganisms abound in all human habitats, where they directly impact human health [4]. The human-made International Space Station (ISS) is a unique and controlled system to study the interplay between the human microbiome and the microbiome of their habitats. The ISS is a hermetically sealed closed system, yet it harbors many microorganisms that survive extreme environmental conditions such as microgravity, radiation and elevated CO2levels [5–8]. Recent studies have demonstrated the unique link between crew member microbiomes and surface microbiomes on the ISS [9]. These microorganisms might have been brought into the ISS via routine payloads and astronauts [9]. Several studies have focused on microbial isolation [10] and molecular microbial community analyses of the ISS microbiome, through experiments performed on vacuum filter debris [11], high-efficiency particle arrestance (HEPA) filters [12,13], the ISS environmental surfaces [8,14] and astronauts’ microbiome [9]. A recent report using a shotgun metagenomic sequencing approach on intact cells of the ISS environmental microbiome revealed the succession and persistence of certain microbial populations on the ISS environmental surfaces [15]. The study posited a dominant, viable presence of Biosafety Level – 2 (BSL-2) pathogens such asKlebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalisandSalmonella enterica(Figure S1). K. pneumoniaeis well-known for its ability to cause pneumonia and other nosocomial infections and is largely studied for its known resistance to a wide spectrum of antibiotics, such as carbapenems, and its hypervirulence [16–20]. The present study is motivated by the evidence presented about the dominance ofK. pneumoniaeat multiple locations of the ISS, its succession over time [15], and the potential clinical implications it could have on the health of the astronauts inhabiting the ISS. Metabolic interactions are a key driver in shaping microbial communities [21]. Studying these metabolic interactions can be instrumental in understanding the interplay between various microorganisms in diverse communities [22–24]. Genome-scale metabolic modeling is a powerful tool to study and understand microbial metabolism [25]. These modeling approaches capture in detail, the known metabolic reactions happening in a microorganism, along with the enzymes that catalyze them, representing them in a mathematical form amenable to simulations [26]. Beyond single microorganisms, metabolic modeling can also be extended to study microbial communities; many paradigms have been developed, including those based on graph theory, and constraint-based modeling, as reviewed elsewhere [27,28]. In this study, we leverage the metagenome datasets that have captured the microbial composition of the ISS surfaces [15] to specifically predict how various species in these communities can influence one another’s metabolism, leading to mutually beneficial interactions and stable microbiomes. In particular, we focus our study onK. pneumoniaeand its coexisting species, to elucidate the possible underlying metabolic interactions that drive the structure of these communities. Through a combination of a systems-based graph-theoretical approach, MetQuest [29,30], and a constraint-based community modeling approach, SteadyCom [31], we illustrate the central role of metabolic interactions and dependencies in shaping the ISS microbiome. In this study, a two-pronged computational approach was adopted to investigate and decipher the prevailing microbial interactions in the ISS. In the first graph-based approach [29], bipartite graphs were created to represent the metabolic networks of microorganisms taken individually, as well as when in pairs or larger communities. The metabolic networks underlying the organisms were represented as bipartite graphs, where two groups of nodes represent metabolites and reactions, and directed edges connect substrates to reactions and reactions to products. These networks were used to identify possible metabolic dependencies between different microorganisms. In the second constraint-based approach [31], microbial growth rates were predicted, individually and in communities, to gauge the nature of their interactions, as we describe in the following sections. Figure1shows a broad overview of the approach of this study, outlining the steps beginning with the identification of microorganisms coexisting withK. pneumoniaeto various metabolic network analyses. Overview of the analysis pipeline. Beginning with identifying a list of microorganisms that coexist withK. pneumoniae, the genome-scale metabolic models were built using KBase and the extent of benefit derived by each individual microorganism in different scenarios was computed using MetQuest and the Metabolic Support Index (MSI) as a metric. SteadyCom, a constraint-based approach, was also employed here to determine the effect of a microorganism on the growth of another and to further classify the nature of their interactions into their respective types based on the observed change in growth rates Microbial abundances associated with samples taken across three flights at eight ISS locations were previously measured using metagenomic sequencing [15]. Among eight locations, only seven locations yielded measurable metagenomics data. In the present study, the data were further pruned such that only shotgun metagenome sequences associated with propidium monoazide (PMA)-treated samples that recorded a presence ofK. pneumoniaewere retained. The PMA-treatment removed naked DNA and dead cells, thus retaining sequences associated with viable and intact cells only [32]. Further, only microorganisms that were found to coexist withK. pneumoniaewith >1% relative abundance at the location were used in this study. Predicting metabolic dependencies in the community To investigate the microbial interactions underlying the chosen microbial communities of the ISS, MetQuest [29], a graph-theoretic algorithm was first employed. Through a novel dynamic-programming-based enumeration, MetQuest assembles reactions into pathways of a specified size producing a given target from a specified set of source molecules (‘seed'). Through a guided breadth-first search, MetQuest can identify all the metabolites that can be traversed from a set of seed metabolites. This functionality was exploited in this study as previously published [30]. Using this algorithm, the present study presents a top-down view of metabolic dependencies in these communities, beginning with predicting the most supportive families, then the most dependent genera, and finally the beneficial and dependent microorganisms by looking at pairs of potentially interacting microorganisms. In each scenario, the extent of benefit derived was calculated using a measure known as the Metabolic Support Index (MSI) [30]. This was also extended to measure the possible support an organism derives from (or provides to) a community where it is present, denoted Community Support Index (CSI). For a pair of microorganisms,AandB, MSI is calculated as follows: Here,nstuck,A∣A∪Brefers to the number of stuck reactions inA, when present in the community alongsideB, whilenstuck,A∣Arefers to the number of stuck reactions inA, when it is present in isolation. Individual bipartite graphs were constructed (n= 52), and the stuck reactions were first determined for every individual microorganism in the dataset, using the MetQuest algorithm as described above, which provided insight into the intrinsic metabolic capabilities of each individual microorganism. Following this, for every pair of coexisting microorganisms that may potentially interact, bipartite graphs were constructed for the two-member community (n= 426), and the stuck reactions were determined for each constituent member of each community, in a flight-location-specific approach (n= 761), to derive the effect of its partner by virtue of being in this community, through the calculation of the MSI. Building further on these interactions, as captured by the MSIs between various microbial pairs, microbial association networks were constructed and visualized using Cytoscape [36]. These networks capture the extent to which a microorganism is able to relieve the stuck reactions of another through metabolic exchanges. The enhancement of metabolic capabilities rendered by a microorganism(s) by virtue of it thriving in a community was derived from the MSI, here referred to as the community support index (CSI). The CSI, denotedCSIA→A~throughout this manuscript, was calculated as the fraction of reactions relieved in the rest of the community over the reactions ‘stuck’ in the same in the presence of the microorganism. For a communityXand an inhabitant microorganism, or family of microorganisms,A, the effect ofAon the rest of the communityA~= (X−A), whereA~denotes the rest of the communityXdevoid of microorganism/familyA, is computed as follows: Here,nstuck,A~∣A~refers to the number of stuck reactions in the communityXwithout microorganismAfor the given set of seed metabolites. A reaction is considered stuck when it does not have the necessary precursors for the reaction to happen. In other words, these are reactions that cannot occur under the present conditions, without extraneous help in terms of other metabolites from other microorganism(s), or the environment itself. Similarly,nstuck,A~∣Xrefers to the number of reactions inA~that remain stuck, even in the presence ofA. We consider only internal reactions (as against transport or extracellular reactions) while computing these numbers. Microorganisms could potentially be metabolically similar, and therefore redundant to the community, offering little or no metabolic support individually. Therefore, microbial interactions were also studied by grouping them by their respective families (n= 7), at each location. The metabolic support provided by groups of microorganisms (e.g., a family) can be readily computed by replacingAinX−Awith the set of microorganisms comprising the family in Eq. (1). It is also possible to estimate the community benefit, in terms of enhancement of metabolic capabilities, an individual microorganism might receive by virtue of it thriving in a community. Here, the CSI, denotedCSIA~→A, was calculated as the fraction of reactions relieved in the microorganism when in a community assemblage over the reactions stuck in the individual. For a communityXand an inhabitant microorganismA, the effect of the rest of the communityA~onAis computed as follows: TheCSIA~→Athus captures the ‘benefit’ a microorganism or a group of microorganisms receives from another microorganism or group, by virtue of its stuck reactions being relieved via metabolic exchanges with its coexisting microorganisms. For clarity, all CSIs and MSIs have been represented as percentages. Determining the nature of interactions Microbial interactions have major relevance in building and shaping the community. Based on the effects a microorganism has on another, the interactions can be categorized into six types, namely amensalism, commensalism, competition, neutralism, mutualism and parasitism [37]. The present study reports a constraint-based community modeling study using the algorithm, SteadyCom [31]. The growth rate observed for each microorganism in community was compared with that observed for the individual microorganism. A 10% or higher increase or decrease in growth rate, when in a community, was taken to be a significant effect [39]. The interactions were accordingly classified into the types listed above. The equation defined below was used to determine the effect of microorganismBonA, in a two-membered community constitutingAandB. wherevbio,ABis the community biomass production rate ofABandvbio,Ais the biomass production rate ofA. Depending on the value (positive [+], negative [−], or neutral [0]) obtained, the interaction was classified as mutualism (the effect ofBonA, and the effect ofAonB, both being positive, i.e., +, +), neutralism (effects on each other being not significant, denoted 0,0), competition (a negative effect on each other, denoted by −,−), amensalism (−,0 and 0,−), commensalism (0,+ and +,0), and parasitism (−,+ and +,−). K. pneumoniaeandA. fumigatusinteractions Overnight grown cultures ofK. pneumoniae(106cells per 100 μL) and purified conidia ofA. fumigatus(106per 100 μL) were either mixed or grown alone in a 10-mL sterile potato extract (0.4%; w/v) dextrose (2%; w/v) liquid medium and grown under normal and simulated microgravity conditions using high aspect ratio vessel (HARV; Synthecon inc., Houston, TX) culturing units [40]. The autoclavable HARVs provided oxygenation to the culture media via their large-diameter gas permeable membrane. The HARVs with microbes were incubated at 30 °C; 150 rpm, for 48 h. HARVs were run in parallel in both horizontal rotation (normal gravity control) and vertical rotation (simulated microgravity) orientation during growth. After growth, the bacterial and fungal cells were harvested, then fixed by incubating the cells in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1M Sodium Cacodylate (Sigma) buffer at 4 °C for 1 h for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) study. Samples were then washed in 0.1M sodium cacodylate buffer three times. Fixed cells were then dehydrated in isopropyl alcohol (IPA, Sigma), using a stepped series of increasing concentrations (50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95 to 100%). Each step consisted of a 10-min incubation at 4 °C, followed by 3 x replacements with 100% IPA, and finally stored at 4 °C. Samples were critically point dried in an Automegasamdri 915B critical point dryer (Tousimis, Rockville, MD). Samples were attached in SEM stubs with carbon tape (Ted Pella Inc., Redding, CA), followed by carbon coating with a Leica EM ACE600 Carbon Evaporator (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) to a thickness of ~12nm. SEM analysis was performed with an FEI Quanta 200F (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA). Data acquisition and genome-scale metabolic network reconstruction Locations with a recorded viable presence ofK. pneumoniae. The figure describes the locations of the ISS at whichK. pneumoniaewas detected from the respective PMA-treated samples, and also features its coexisting microorganisms that inhabit the location at >1% relative abundance. The networks have been drawn on Cytoscape for all three time points of the study by Singh et al. 2018: Flight 1 (F1), Flight 2 (F2) and Flight 3 (F3). The octagonal location nodes have been color coded according to the ISS Node they belong to. Locations #1, #2 and #3 belong to Node 3; locations #4 and #5 to Node 1; location #6 (not shown here) to PMM and location #7 to the US Laboratory. The microbial nodes have been color-coded such that those existing at more than one location withK. pneumoniaeare shown in grey, implying that a microorganism found in a large number of locations (such asK. pneumoniaein F3) will be filled with a darker shade of grey Enterobacteriaceaeare pivotal contributors to community metabolism These low values ofCSIA→A~are expected, given the possible high metabolic overlap between members within a community, thereby rendering individual organisms less important to a community. To examine this, we grouped organisms based on their phylogenetic affiliation, and removed these groups, one at a time, from the community, to study the importance of a given family to the community. Metabolic support provided by each family to the remaining community. The values on the tiles denote the Community Support Index (CSIA→A~) calculated in the presence of the family. The values are represented as percentages. TheX-axis denotes the families present in the dataset, and theY-axis denotes the respective locations. The heatmap has been facetted to indicate the three timepoints, i.e., Flights Pantoea species thrive in the support of the microbiome Extent of metabolic benefit derived by an individual microorganism from its coexisting microorganisms. The heatmap depicts the range of Community Support Indices (CSIA~→A) that indicate the metabolic support rendered to an individual by virtue of it being in that location. The values are represented as percentages. On theX-axis is the list of microorganisms in consideration, and on theY-axis is the flight number and the concerned location number. A darker red tile indicates the microorganism is benefitted to a greater extent in that flight and location With the exception ofE. coliandS. enterica, theCSIA~→Avalues of otherEnterobacteriaceaefell in the range of 0–0.91%, suggesting an overall lower dependence of members of theEnterobacteriaceaeon their coexisting microorganisms (Fig.4).K. pneumoniaeshowed no dependency (CSIA~→A= 0%) in six out of the 11 locations that they were found. In addition,S. entericaexhibited the highest community dependence amongst all microorganisms in consideration, with aCSIA~→A= 8.79% at location #3 during Flight 3, and along withE. coli,showed highCSIA~→Avalues (Fig.4). K. pneumoniaeare beneficialtoits coexisting microorganisms In every community, microorganisms exchange metabolites, influencing one another’s growth and survival. We performed a pairwise analysis of a total of 761 flight-location-specific communities to identify how every pair of microorganisms interacts with one another, at a given location, during a given flight, and through various metabolic exchanges support each other. Microbial association networks for pairs of microorganisms inhabiting location 5, across the three flights. Cytoscape was used to construct and visualize these networks across three flights: Flight 1 (F1), Flight 2 (F2) and Flight 3 (F3). The nodes are labelled with microorganisms that inhabit the site at that respective time point. The directed edges are directed from the metabolically supportive microorganism to the metabolically dependent microorganism. The color of these directed edges are mapped to the Metabolic Support Indices (MSI), represented as percentages, such that the gradient from light blue to dark blue represents an increasing MSI Constraint-based modeling suggests the domination of amensalistic and parasitic interactions The graph-theoretic approaches described earlier do not explicitly account for the growth of microorganisms in the presence of one another or their rates, although a higher MSI does point towards a possible higher biomass in the community [30]. Complementary to the above approaches, constraint-based modeling approaches such as SteadyCom [31] can shed light on the ability of microorganisms to grow in a steady-state. Based on these predicted growth rates, it is also possible to classify the nature of the interaction between various pairs of microorganisms [37]. A total of 761 flight-location-specific pairs of microorganisms were studied. Among these, 458 pairs exhibited amensalism and 166 were predicted to be parasitism. Of the remaining, 48 were commensal, 36 were competitive, 34 were mutualistic and 19 were neutral. Looking closely into the nature of interactions ofK. pneumoniaeand its coexisting microorganisms, in 118 such pairs, 72 were predicted to be amensal, 14 commensal, 13 involved in competition, 10 were parasitic interactions, seven were mutual and two were neutral. In communities with theEnterobacterspecies,K. pneumoniaewas involved in amensalistic interactions as observed across all such flight-location pairs. While in the interactions withE. cancerogenusandEnterobactersp. strain NFIX59, the growth rate ofK. pneumoniaewas predicted to decrease, in the interactions with all otherEnterobacterspecies, there was no significant effect on the predicted growth rate ofK. pneumoniae. In eight out of nine flight-location-specific communities ofK. pneumoniaewithE. coli,E. coliwas predicted to have no significant change in growth rate while that ofK. pneumoniaewas predicted to decrease, suggesting an amensalistic interaction. Further, in Flight 3, at location #3,E. coliwas predicted to be parasitic towardsK. pneumoniae. In the interactions withS. enterica, in four out of the six locations, the growth rate ofK. pneumoniaewas decreased in its presence, whereas that ofS. entericawas increased, resulting in a parasitic interaction. This is in accordance with the previously observed high MSI values at locations #3, #5, #7, and #8 during Flight 3. In the other cases during Flight 1 at location #2 and Flight 3 at location #1, the interaction was predicted to be amensalistic, wherein the growth rate ofK. pneumoniaewas reduced. With otherKlebsiellaspecies, the interactions were predicted to be predominantly amensalistic, with the growth rate ofK. pneumoniaereduced, except in the interaction withKlebsiellasp. strain MS 92-3, where the reverse was observed.K. pneumoniaewas predicted to be parasitic towardsK. aerogenesstrain IIIF7SW-P1. Key interactions withKlebsiella pneumoniae. The network diagrams depict the nature of interactions pertaining to those ofAKlebsiella pneumoniaewith coexistingPantoeaspeciesBKlebsiella pneumoniaewith the coexisting fungi. The color and arrowheads of the edge indicate the nature of the observed interaction, and the edge labels correspond to the flight-location in which that type of interaction was observed. The nodes ofK. pneumoniaeandK. pneumoniaestrain F3-2P(2*) have been increased in size solely for the purpose of clarity Detrimental effect ofK. pneumoniaeonAspergillus fumigatus The parasitic interactions ofK. pneumoniaeonA. nigerwere observed using various microscopic techniques (data not shown). SinceA. nigeris not a pathogenic bacterium, we extensively characterized an ISS isolatedA. fumigatus, a BSL-2 bacterium, to understand the detrimental effect ofK. pneumoniae. The scanning electron micrographs confirmed the parasitic effect ofK. pneumoniaeoverA. fumigatus(Fig.7). Under normal gravity conditions,A. fumigatuswas found to be healthy where conidiophore holding vesicle with healthy metulae and phialides harboring conidia were noticed (Fig.7A), whereas simulated microgravity affected the phialides structure (Fig.7C) and subsequently conidia-forming cells were not clearly visible. WhenK. pneumoniaewas co-cultured with the fungus, under normal gravity conditions, the bacterial cells (artificially colored in red) were shown to destroy the conidia-forming cells and also partially degraded metulae and phialides (Fig.7B). Antagonistic characteristics ofK. pneumoniaewhen co-cultured withA. fumigatusunder simulated microgravity.AA. fumigatusgrown under normal gravity.BBoth bacteria and fungus grown under normal gravity.CA. fumigatusgrown under simulated gravity.DBoth bacteria and fungus grown under simulated gravity.K. pneumoniaecells were artificially colored to show their presence on and around fungus culture. These pictures are representative of hundreds of SEM images Furthermore, whenK. pneumoniaecells were grown with the fungus and incubated in simulated microgravity conditions, bacterial cells destroyed the fungal structure where only vesicle was seen along with the conidia and phialides, additionally the metulae were disformed and the hyphae (Fig.7D) appeared to be disfigured compared to those seen in Fig.7A or B. When co-cultured, the hyphae ofA. fumigatusappeared to be healthy when grown under normal gravity (Fig.7B) and mostly dead when exposed to the simulated microgravity (Fig.7D). The number of conidia were also less and on top of the conidia-forming cells the fungal morphological architecture changed. These changes were more obvious in microcosm where bothK. pneumoniaeandA. fumigatuswere co-cultured and exposed to the simulated microgravity (Fig.7D) than in the setup that were not exposed to simulated microgravity (Fig.7B). Interpretation of image data was based on careful analysis of multiple images (n= 100), not only on a single micrograph of each test condition. In this study, we used a metabolic perspective to analyze the ISS microbiome with a focus onK. pneumoniae, a BSL-2 human pathogen, and its coexisting microorganisms. In our two-pronged approach, we first used a graph-theoretical approach to unravel the metabolic interdependencies in the microbiome, and we further complemented this with constraint-based analyses, to identify the consequences of microbial interactions on growth. We begin by looking at higher-order interactions in the community and further delve deeper and look at pairwise interactions that have been previously shown to be major drivers of community dynamics [41]. We traverse three taxonomic levels—family, genus and species and provide insights into the keystone species of the community through metabolic network analyses. Even though <7% of the metagenomic reads of ISS environmental surfaces constituted BSL-2 microorganisms, the dominant and persistent human microbial pathogens werePantoea, Klebsiella, Staphylococcus, ErwiniaandPenicillium[15].Among the ISS surfaces, Zero-G Stowage Rack (Location #5) had morePantoeareads compared to other locations of all flights. When metagenomic reads of all BSL-2 microorganisms were compiled,K. pneumoniaewas found to be persistent and dominant in Zero-G Stowage Rack of all three flights (Fig.2). In general,K. pneumoniaereads were more and dominant in all seven locations sampled in Flight 3. Unlike in Flight 3,K. pneumoniaereads were retrieved sparingly in Flight 1 (Cupola and WHC) and Flight 2 (Zero-G Stowage Rack). The cleaning reagent used in ISS consists of benzalkonium chloride, which might be able to eradicate the fungal population; thus fungal succession was not observed, unlike bacterial members which were persistent in the ISS locations examined [42]. It is also documented thatK. pneumoniaecells were resistant to the quaternary ammonium compound concentration used as cleaning agents in ISS [43]. On applying graph-theoretical algorithms and surveying the microbiome at multiple levels, we predicted that among the families in the dataset, members of theEnterobacteriaceaefamily were perhaps the most beneficial to other microorganisms in the community, whereas in most cases, members of the families such asErwiniaceae, StaphylococcaceaeandSporidiobolaceae(yeast) offered little or no additional metabolic benefit to the community. It has been documented that someRhodotorulaspecies produced silver nanoparticles containing antimicrobial properties against a wide variety of Gram-positive and negative microorganisms [44]. The members of the familySporidiobolaceae(Rhodotorula,pink yeast) were isolated from the ISS locations [8], their antagonistic and parasitic behavior predicted during this study should be tested against opportunistic microbial pathogens to aid in the development of appropriate countermeasures. Similarly, the amensalism predicted towardsErwiniaceaeand mutualism ofStaphylococcaceaemembers withK. pneumoniaeneed further study utilizing the ISS strains. At the genus level, we observed thatPantoeagenus typically derives the most benefit in the community. On looking at the pairwise interactions, we observed that amongst otherEnterobacteriaceae,K. pneumoniaeprovides metabolic support to many of its coexisting species, notably those from thePantoeagenus. The members of the genusPantoeawere primarily considered as plant pathogens, but subsequently, they have been isolated from many aquatic and terrestrial environments, including ISS [8] as well as in association with insects, animals and humans [45–49]. During this study [8], the metagenomic sequences of the opportunistic human pathogens associated withPantoeagenus wereP. agglomerans, P. conspicua, P. brenneri, P. ananatisandP. dispersa,whereas the plant pathogenicPantoeaspecies were not observed. The competitive metabolomic properties predicted during this study byK. pneumoniaewithPantoeamembers (Fig.6A) might be due to the assimilation of similar compounds for sustaining their growth. Detailed phenotypic metabolic profiles of these microbes are needed to confirm the competition and amensalism predicted in this study. Finally, from the constraint-based analyses, many amensal and parasitic interactions were noticed. This is corroborated by earlier findings thatK. pneumoniaecan inhibit fungal conidia germination and hyphal growth, as well as biofilm formation ofAspergillusspecies [50]. Recent reports documented thatK. pneumoniaeshifted to a pathogenic state, potentially leading to septic infections when cooccurred withA. fumigatusin immunocompromised individuals [50]. In addition, this study shows thatK. pneumoniaecells prevented germination of conidia and hyphal development of the fungi. It has been further shown thatK. pneumoniaebacterial cells induced the fungal cell wall stress response mechanisms and suppressed the filamentous growth of fungi [50]. The simple in silico metabolic model of this study predicted the antagonistic (parasitic) metabolic interaction betweenK. pneumoniaeandA. niger(Fig.6B), which further enabled to validate parasitism in vivo, using the strains isolated from the ISS. However, this experimental evidence might not be enough to fully prove the metabolic prediction. Additional positive and negative controls are necessary, which would further improve the evidence of antagonistic metabolic interaction predicted during this study. Furthermore, quantitative measurements ofK. pneumoniaeandAspergillusgrowth are needed to validate the computational prediction of this study and warrants further study. Our study does have some limitations. First, the metabolic models used in the study are automated reconstructions, which despite gap-filling, could potentially contain gaps and blocked reactions and need to be curated [51]. Nevertheless, such automated reconstructions are being widely used in many studies as they serve as useful predictive tools and representations of the metabolism of microorganisms [52]. Secondly, wherever it is applicable, genomes generated from the cultured ISS microorganisms were utilized. Conversely, when strains were not isolated from the ISS environment, and thus, genomes were not available, the reference genomes of the corresponding type strains were used. However, reference genomes provide a useful perspective of an organism’s metabolic capabilities and have also been used in many other studies that incorporate metabolic models [53,54]. In the absence of exact estimates of environmental metabolites, we posited that the environment had at least the minimal set of metabolites necessary for a given organism to survive, and also included additional cofactors and coenzymes. We assumed that each microorganism is capable of minimal independent growth and thus calculated the minimal medium required to support survival. It is possible that some of the interactions remain conserved, in richer media, although others may disappear, depending on the inherent metabolic capabilities of the organisms.
