This review covers advances made in genome mining SMs produced byAspergillus nidulans,Aspergillus fumigatus,Aspergillus niger, andAspergillus terreusin the past six years (2012–2018). Genetic identification and molecular characterization of SM biosynthetic gene clusters, along with proposed biosynthetic pathways, is discussed in depth. Secondary metabolites (SMs) produced by filamentous fungi possess diverse bioactivities that make them excellent drug candidates. Whole genome sequencing has revealed that fungi have the capacity to produce a far greater number of SMs than have been isolated, since many of the genes involved in SM biosynthesis are either silent or expressed at very low levels in standard laboratory conditions. There has been significant effort to activate SM biosynthetic genes and link them to their downstream products, as the SMs produced by these “cryptic” pathways offer a promising source for new drug discovery. Further, an understanding of the genes involved in SM biosynthesis facilitates product yield optimization of first-generation molecules and genetic engineering of second-generation analogs. This review covers advances made in genome mining SMs produced byAspergillus nidulans,Aspergillus fumigatus,Aspergillus niger, andAspergillus terreusin the past six years (2012–2018). Genetic identification and molecular characterization of SM biosynthetic gene clusters, along with proposed biosynthetic pathways, will be discussed in depth. Filamentous fungi, including those within theAspergillusgenus, are known to produce a vast array of secondary metabolites (SMs) that exhibit a broad range of biological activities. SMs are organic small molecules that confer selective advantage to the organism despite not being directly required for survival. In nature, SMs function as weapons to eliminate neighboring competition, chemical signals in microbial cell communication, agents of symbiosis and transportation, sexual hormones, or differentiation effectors.1However, SMs also possess various characteristics that make them great drug candidates, which has resulted in their extensive use in the pharmaceutical industry. For example, they exhibit enormous structural and chemical diversity due to the enzymatic nature of their biosynthesis, in which the core backbone of the SM is often biosynthesized by either a polyketide synthase (PKS), which can be either non-reducing (NR-PKS) or highly-reducing (HR-PKS), a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), a PKS–NRPS hybrid, a dimethylallyl tryptophan synthase (DMATS), or a terpene cyclase (TC). The carbon skeleton is then further diversified by various tailoring enzymes encoded by genes that are usually clustered in the genome with the SM core backbone gene.2Tailoring enzymes may include oxidoreductases, oxygenases, dehydrogenases, reductases, and transferases. This process facilitates many reactions that are not possible synthetically and therefore SMs often feature more chiral centers and increased steric complexity than synthetic molecules. Further, because SMs have evolved within a biological setting, they usually possess many favorable drug-like properties. SMs currently represent a significant source of antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, antiparasitic, anti-infective, anticancer, and antidiabetic drugs.3Notable examples include the antibiotic penicillin, the cholesterol-lowering statin lovastatin, the antitumor agent paclitaxel,4and the immunosuppressant cyclosporine.5Additionally, the majority of small-molecule drugs introduced between 1981 and 2010 were either SMs, SM derivatives, SM mimics, or possessed a SM pharmacophore, and approximately 49% of all anticancer drugs are SMs or were inspired by SMs.3 Genome sequencing ofAspergillusspecies has greatly illuminated the potential for further drug discovery within theAspergillusgenus, revealing that the number of predicted SM biosynthetic genes or gene clusters considerably exceeds the number of identified SMs. A primary reason for this is that the majority of genes involved in SM biosynthesis are either silent or expressed at very low levels in standard laboratory conditions.6This is a logical phenomenon given the natural functions of SMs, as laboratory culture conditions lack the life-threatening or competitive circumstances likely to trigger SM production. Expression of these genes sometimes requires exposure to a specific condition or stressful environment, and therefore culturing fungi in various conditions can result in the production of different SMs.7Other times, genetic engineering techniques, such as heterologous expression or the use of inducible promoters, are required. Since the sequencing of the firstAspergillusgenome in 2005,8researchers have used bioinformatics to identify and characterize the SM biosynthetic gene clusters present in various species ofAspergillus.9There have been considerable efforts to activate silent clusters and link them to their downstream products, as genome mining these “cryptic” pathways offer a promising source for new drug discovery.10Further, linking known therapeutically-relevant SMs to their biosynthesis genes facilitates genetic manipulation efforts to optimize product yields of first-generation compounds and engineer second-generation compounds. 2. The status of genome miningAspergillussecondary metabolites 3. Genetic characterization of secondary metabolites inAspergillus nidulans 3.1. Biosynthesis ofent-pimara-8(14),15-diene The silent SM gene cluster of the novel diterpeneent-pimara-8(14),15-diene was activated through overexpression of the Zn(ii)2Cys6transcription factor PbcR present in the cluster.25This led to high up-regulation of 7 adjacent genes encoding a diterpene synthase, a geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase, a HMG-CoA reductase, a translation elongation factor, a short-chain dehydrogenase, a hypothetical protein with partial similarity to methyltransferase, and a cytochrome P450, as well as the production ofent-pimara-8(14),15-diene. Based on this information, the biosynthesis ofent-pimara-8(14),15-diene was proposed to involve HMG-CoA reductase AN1593 to generate mevalonate and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase AN1592 to generate geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (Scheme 1). Next, the diterpene synthase AN1594 was proposed to catalyze two cyclization reactions to generateent-pimara-8(14),15-diene through aent-copalyl diphosphate intermediate. Scheme 1. Biosynthesis ofent-pimara-8(14),15-diene inA. nidulans.25. 3.2. Biosynthesis of asperniduglene A1 The asperniduglenes were discovered upon activation of thesdggene cluster inA. nidulans, which harbors genes with similarity to the citreoviridin (ctv) gene cluster inA. terreus.26Interestingly, despite the similarity of the cluster to thectvcluster, the asperniduglenes fall into a different class of compounds than citreoviridin. The cluster was activated by replacing the promoters of genes within thesdgcluster with the induciblealcApromoter. Large-scale cultivation and examination of SMs and intermediates produced by mutant strains enabled the biosynthetic pathway of asperniduglene A1 to be proposed (Scheme 2). First, the polyketide product is biosynthesized by the HR-PKS SdgA, followed by epoxidation by SdgC, and subsequent ketone formationviaMeinwald rearrangement, likely catalyzed by SdgF. Next, SdgC catalyzes a second epoxidation on the last olefin, followed by stereospecific cyclization and hydrolytic cleavage, both of which may be catalyzed by SdgD, to form asperniduglene A1. Scheme 2. Biosynthesis of asperniduglene A1 inA. nidulans.26. 3.3. Biosynthesis of aspernidine A Scheme 3. Biosynthesis of aspernidine A inA. nidulans.28. 3.4. Biosynthesis of microperfuranone To investigate SMs produced by NRPS-like genes, scientists replaced the native promoters of the 13 predicted NRPS-like genes inA. nidulanswith the induciblealcApromoter.30Induction of NRPS-like MicA resulted in enhanced production of microperfuranone, which has previously been isolated fromAnixiella micropertusaandEmericella nidulans.31,32Heterologous expression ofmicAinA. nigerconfirmed that MicA is solely responsible for the biosynthesis of microperfuranone, which was proposed to involve the joining of two units of phenylpyruvic acidviaan aldol condensation reaction while tethered to MicA (Scheme 4). Next, the tethered intermediate undergoes sulfur-mediated cyclization to yield a furan ring, followed by decarboxylation and keto–enol tautomerization to form microperfuranone. Scheme 4. Biosynthesis of microperfuranone inA. nidulans.30. 3.5. Biosynthesis of fellutamide B Fellutamide B, which was originally isolated fromPenicillium fellutanum, is a potent proteasome inhibitor that also induces nerve growth factor release.33In the past decade proteasome inhibitors have emerged as effective anticancer agents, with several second-generation proteasome inhibitors currently being tested in clinical settings.34–36To identify biosynthetic gene clusters that may be involved in the production of proteasome inhibitors, researchers searched for potential resistance genes harbored within SM gene clusters inA. nidulans.37Interestingly, they found that within theinpcluster,inpEencoded a putative proteasome component, which has no obvious role in SM biosynthesis. The silentinpcluster was activated by replacing the promoters of six genes within the cluster with the inducible promoteralcA, which revealed that fellutamide B is the SM cluster's final product. The fellutamide B biosynthetic gene cluster contains two NRPS genes, a predicted fatty-acyl-AMP ligase, a NRPS product release/transfer protein, a transporter, andinpE, which was found to confer resistance to internally produced fellutamide B.37Biosynthesis of fellutamide B was proposed to involve initial activation of 3-hydroxydodecanoic acid by IncP to form 3-hydroxydodecanoyl-AMP, which undergoes addition ofl-Asn andl-Gln while tethered to InpB, followed by addition ofl-Leu while tethered to InpA (Scheme 5). The product is then released to yield fellutamide B. Scheme 5. Biosynthesis of fellutamide B inA. nidulans.37. Culturing ofA. nidulanson yeast extract sucrose (YES) led to the production of cichorine, which is a phytotoxin that possesses activity against corn, soybeans, and knapweed.38,39The cichorine biosynthetic gene cluster was identified using targeted individual gene deletions, revealing that the gene cluster consisted of NR-PKS-encodingpkbA, regulatory protein-encodingcicD, transporter-encodingcicA, and four tailing protein-encoding genes.38Analysis of extracts produced by deletion strains enabled some insights into the cichorine biosynthetic pathway (Scheme 6), which involves initial production of 3-methyl-orsellinic acid by the PKS PkbA, which undergoes a ring-closing transformation by CicB and/or CicH, followed by phenol group methylation by CicE to yield nidulol. The remaining steps in cichorine biosynthesis involve a lactone to lactam conversion carried genes found outside thecicSM gene cluster, perhaps by genes within a different cluster, such as the case with xanthone and terpene biosynthesis inA. nidulans.40,41 Scheme 6. Biosynthesis of cichorine inA. nidulans.38. 3.7. Biosynthesis aspercryptin Scheme 7. Biosynthesis of aspercryptin inA. nidulans.48. 3.8. Biosynthesis of felinone A To search for negative regulators of secondary metabolism, researchers generated auxotrophic mutants by replacing the coding sequences of target SM core synthase enzymes with theA. fumigatus riboBgene (AfriboB).50Thus, when the target SM cluster is inactive, the fungus will not be able to survive without media supplementation of riboflavin. The strain was then mutagenized with 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (NQO), which causes base-pair substitutions, and subsequent growth without riboflavin enabled the detection of strains in which the induced mutations resulted in SM cluster activation. This technique enabled the identification of the transcription factormcrA. Investigation of SM production in mutant strains lacking and overexpressingmcrArevealed that it is a negative regulator of at least ten SM clusters inA. nidulans. Additionally, large-scale cultivation of themcrA-deletion strain enabled the isolation of the antibiotic felinone A.51Examination of the structure of felinone A, combined with products previously reported to be produced by thedbacluster,29,52enabled the biosynthetic pathway for felinone A to be proposed (Scheme 8). The pathway involves generation of the polyketide product by the NR-PKS DbaI, followed by dearomatizationviahydroxylation by the FAD-binding monooxygenase DbaH. The final steps of the pathway include a ring closure to generate an azaphilone ring system followed by several reductive steps that have not been clarified yet. Scheme 8. Biosynthesis of felinone A inA. nidulans.50. 3.9. Biosynthesis 4′-methoxyviridicatin Quinolone alkaloids are a class of SMs that exhibit a broad range of medicinally relevant characteristics, including antibiotic, antiviral, antimalarial, and antitumor activities.53A 6,6-quinolone scaffold is present in a variety of quinolone alkaloids, including 4′-methoxyviridicatin and structurally similar viridicatin, which exhibits strong activity againstMycobacterium tuberculosis.54To elucidate the biosynthetic nature of this class of compounds, a silent candidate cluster containing genes encoding an NRPS, a prenyltransferase, terpene cyclases, and redox enzymes was activated through overexpression of the NRPS AsqK.55A combination ofin vivoandin vitroassays were conducted to elucidate the biosynthetic pathway of 4′-methoxyviridicatin (Scheme 9). The proposed pathway involves an anthranilic acid andO-methyl-l-tyrosine precursor, which undergo conversion to 4′-methoxycyclopeptin by NRPS AsqK. Next, the dioxygenase AsqJ catalyzes two distinct oxidation reactions, the first being a desaturation reaction to form a double bond and yield 4′-methoxydehydrocyclopeptine, followed by monooxygenation of that double bond to form an epoxide and yield (–)-4′-methoxycyclopenine. Interestingly, this epoxide formation then facilitates subsequent non-enzymatic rearrangement to form the 6,6-quinolone viridiatin scaffold from the 6,7-bicyclic core of (–)-4′-methoxycyclopenine, yielding 4′-methoxyviridicatin. Scheme 9. Biosynthesis of 4′-methoxyviridicatin inA. nidulans.55. 3.10. Biosynthesis of grey-brown conidiophore pigment Fungal pigments have a wide range of beneficial properties, including antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anticancer activities, and can act as natural alternatives to chemically synthesized colorants.56Historically, the NRPS IvoA and the phenol oxidase IvoB were known to be involved in grey-brown condidiophore pigment production,57although its biosynthetic pathway had not been fully elucidated. Additionally, microarray expression data had revealed that the gene adjacent toivoA,ivoC, was coregulated withivoA.58Researchers therefore replaced the native promoters ofivoA,ivoB, andivoCwith the inducible promoteralcA, which resulted in hyphal accumulation of dark pigments.59The biosynthetic pathway was reconstructed in a stepwise manner to assign functions to each involved gene, revealing that IvoA is the first NRPS known to acetylate tryptophan, leading toN-acetyltryptophan. IvoC is then responsible for 6-hydroxylation ofN-tryptophan, followed by subsequent oxidation by IvoB to yield grey-brown conidiophore pigment (Scheme 10). Scheme 10. Biosynthesis of grey-brown conidiophore pigment inA. nidulans.57,59. 3.11. Biosynthesis of (+)-asperlin The SM (+)-asperlin, whose production has been reported inA. nidulans,Aspergillus caespitosus, andAspergillus versicolor, possesses antibiotic, anti-inflammatory, and antitumor activity.60–64The biosynthetic gene cluster responsible for (+)-asperlin production was recently identified inA. nidulansusing a novel cluster activation method that features the use of a hybrid transcription factor,65as previous attempts to activate this cluster through overexpression of the cluster's transcription factor were unsuccessful.29Up-regulation of the hybrid transcription factor, which featured the DNA-binding domain of the cluster's native transcription factor fused to the activation domain of the asperfuranone gene cluster transcription factor AfoA, led to production of (+)-asperlin. Targeted gene deletions in combination with RNA-seq confirmed the involvement of 10 genes in the biosynthesis of (+)-asperlin, which were designated asalnA–alnIandalnR. Additionally, (2Z,4Z,6E)-octa-2,4,6-trienoic acid, which exhibits photoprotectant properties,66was identified as a biosynthetic pathway intermediate (Scheme 11). The individual steps involved in the biosynthesis of (+)-asperlin remain to be fully elucidated. Scheme 11. Biosynthesis of (+)-asperlin inA. nidulans.65. 4. Genetic characterization of secondary metabolites inAspergillus fumigatus 4.1. Biosynthesis of hexadehydroastechrome Scheme 12. Biosynthesis of hexadehydroastechrome inA. fumigatus.73. 4.2. Biosynthesis of endocrocin The anthraquinone endocrocin has been isolated from a broad range of species, including various fungi,74,75plants,76and insects.77Historically, anthraquinones have been known to display various medicinal properties, such as anti-inflammatory and antitumor bioactivities, and have been used in dyes, cosmetics, paper manufacturing, and as food additives.76,78,79However, more recently endocrocin was found to contribute to the pathogenicity ofA. fumigatusthrough inhibition of neutrophil recruitment.80Interestingly, endocrocin was found to be biosynthesized through two distinct routes by physically discrete clustersencandtpcinA. fumigatus.81,82Biosynthesis by theenccluster was initially reported inA. fumigatusCEA10-derived strains,81which did not produce trypacidin due to a single nucleotide mutation present in PKS-encodingtpcC.83To elucidate the biosynthetic pathway of endocrocin inA. fumigatus, the genome was surveyed for a candidate NR-PKS. Endocrocin was previously identified as a biosynthetic intermediate of monodictyphenone that was only produced in strains lacking the activity of the decarboxylase MdpH.84Bioinformatics were therefore used to search for proteins with similarity to the monodictyphenone-producing NR-PKS MdpG inA. nidulans, which revealed the identification of three NR-PKS genes within theA. fumigatusgenome. The biosynthetic gene clusters of two of the NR-PKSs suggested a final product more complex than endocrocin, so researchers focused on the third NR-PKS, which they named EncA. The NR-PKS EncA lacked the thioesterase (TE) or Claisen cyclase (CLC) domain that is usually responsible for releasing the nascent polyketide product in this class of enzymes.85,86In such TE-less enzymes, the polyketide product is instead released by metallo-β-lactamase-type thioesterases enzymes.87To confirm involvement of EncA in the biosynthesis of endocrocin, aencA-mutant was generated, which resulted in a strain deficient in endocrocin production.81Subsequent deletion of tailoring genes revealed the involvement of the metallo-β-lactamase domain protein EncB and the anthrone oxidase EncC in endocrocin biosynthesis, which enabled its biosynthetic pathway to be proposed (Scheme 13). Surprisingly, deletion of the cluster geneencDresulted in increased production of endocrocin, which could have occurred for two reasons: EncD may catalyze the formation of an unknown product from endocrocin or EncD may inhibit endocrocin biosynthesis by converting an intermediate to an unknown product.81 Scheme 13. Biosynthesis of endocrocin inA. fumigatus.81. 4.3. Biosynthesis of trypacidin The spore metabolite trypacidin, which was initially identified as an anti-protozoal agent,88,89was more recently shown to be cytotoxic against human lung cells.90A candidate cluster for trypacidin biosynthesis was identified as a cluster harboring the TE-less NR-PKS TpcC,82which belongs to the same NR-PKS clade as the endocrocin PKS inA. fumigatus,81the monodicyphenone PKS inA. nidulans,84and the geodin PKS inA. terreus.91The 13 genes within the cluster, 12 of which displayed high sequence homology to the geodin-producing cluster,91were individually deleted and mutant strains were analyzed for the production of pathway intermediates,82which enabled proposal of the trypacidin biosynthetic pathway (Scheme 14). The first few steps are identical to that of endocrocin biosynthesis, with the generation of atrochrysone carboxylic acid from NR-PKS TpcC and metallo-β-lactamase TpcB. TpcK then catalyzes decarboxylation to yield atrochrysone, which then undergoes dehydration to yield emodin anthrone. The anthrone oxygenase TpcL catalyzes the addition of a ketone functional group to yield emodin, followed by activity of theO-methyltransferase TpcA to yield questin. The remaining steps in the pathway were proposed based on comparison to similar pathways, and involve a ring opening catalyzed by TpcG, TpcI, and TpcF, followed byO-methylation by both TpcM and TpcH to generate monomethylsulochrin, which is then converted to trypacidin by TpcJ. Scheme 14. Biosynthesis of trypacidin inA. fumigatus.82. 4.4. Biosynthesis of helvolic acid Fusidane-type antibiotics are a class of fungi-derived triterpenes that include helvolic acid,92fusidic acid,93and cephalosporin P1,94all which display potent activity against Gram-positive bacteria.95Structurally, they have a characteristic tetracyclic core that is generated from enzymatic cyclization of (3S)-2,3-oxidosqualene.96Notably, fusidane-type antibiotics have exhibited no cross-resistance to commonly used antibiotics,97,98which has drawn the attention of scientists to search for analogs with increased bioactivity.99Researchers therefore investigated the full biosynthetic pathway of helvolic acid, as such understanding can facilitate the development of useful fusidane-type antibiotic derivatives. A portion of genes within the helvolic-acid-producinghelcluster had previously been identified. To further characterize the cluster, its nine genes were heterologously introduced stepwise inAspergillus oryzae, which resulted in the production and of helvolic acid and 21 derivatives, three of which exhibited increased antibiotic activity againstStaphylococcus aureuswhen compared to helvolic acid.100A biosynthetic pathway was proposed for helvolic acid (Scheme 15), which involves initial cyclization of (3S)-2,3-oxidosqualene by oxidosqualene cyclase HelA to yield protosta-17(20)Z,24-dien-3β-ol. The intermediate then undergoes two rounds of oxidation by HelB1 and HelB2, followed by acetylation by HelD2, oxidation by HelB4, and oxidative decarboxylation by HelC. Next, HelB3 mediates two oxidative reactions which result in hydroxyl and ketone formation, followed byO-acetylation by HelD1, and dehydrogenation by HelE to yield helvolic acid. Interestingly, this study revealed unique roles for HelB1 and HelC, which work together to remove the C-4β methyl group through oxidation followed by decarboxylation, a mechanism distinct from the similar demethylation reaction that occurs during sterol biosynthesis. Scheme 15. Biosynthesis of helvolic acid inA. fumigatus.100. 4.5. Biosynthesis of fumipyrrole A. fumigatusis capable of surviving in a myriad of distinct niches, ranging from the human lung, where it can cause invasive aspergillosis in immunocompromised individuals, to decaying vegetation, where it plays important roles in breaking down organic matter.101The capacity to readily survive in different habitats, which correlates with pathogenicity in physiological environments, is largely dependent on the ability to sense external stimuli and respond with different signal transduction cascades, including the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)/protein kinase A (PKA) pathway.102To explore the targets of the cAMP/PKA pathway, the catalytic subunit 1 of PKA was overexpressed, which resulted in induction of the pathway and differential expression of various genes, including high up-regulation of the transcription factorfmpR, which is harbored in a SM gene cluster.103To identify the SM produced by this cluster,fmpRwas overexpressed using the Tet-on system,104which led to activation of six other cluster genes encoding the NRPS FmpE, the fructosyl amino acid oxidase FmpA, hypothetical proteins FmpB and FmpC, ABC multidrug transporter FmpD, and the phenol-2-monooxygenase FmpF. The product produced by this biosynthetic gene cluster was identified as the novel SM fumipyrrole (Scheme 16). Scheme 16. Biosynthesis of fumipyrrole inA. fumigatus.103. 4.6. Biosynthesis of neosartoricin and fumicyclines The meroterpenoid neosartoricin was first isolated following activation of the six-genensc/fcccluster in bothA. fumigatusandNeosartorya fischeri, which harbors genes encoding the TE-less NR-PKS NscA/FccA, the metallo-β-lactamase-type thioesterase NscB/FccB, the Flavin-dependent monooxygenase NscC/FccC, the polycyclic prenyltransferase NscD/FccD, the NAD-dependent dehydratase NscE/FccE, and the pathway-specific Zn(ii)2Cys6transcription factor NscR/FccR.105In both species, the cluster was activated through overexpression of NscR/FccR. Shortly after, related fumicyclines A and B were isolated fromA. fumigatusfollowing cocultivation withStreptomyces rapamycinicus.106Full genome microarrays were used to identify the gene cluster responsible for production of fumicyclines, which revealed up-regulation of thensc/fccgene cluster following cocultivation. To confirm the involvement of this cluster, NR-PKS-encodingnscA/fccAwas deleted, which resulted in complete elimination of fumicycline production. For both studies, the biosynthetic pathway of neosartoricin and fumicyclines was proposed based on the detection of intermediates and shunt products (Scheme 17). Biosynthesis initiates with reactions catalyzed by the NR-PKS NscA/FccA and release of the nascent polyketide product by NscB/FccB. The intermediate then undergoes a loss of CO2, followed by prenylation catalyzed by NscD/FccD and hydroxylation by NscC/FccC to yield fumicycline B. Fumicycline B then undergoesO-acetylation to yield neosartoricin or dehydration to yield fumicycline A. Scheme 17. Biosynthesis of neosartoricin and fumicyclines inA. fumigatus.105,106. 4.7. Biosynthesis of fumagillin Since its discovery in 1951, the antibiotic fumagillin has been extensively studied for its medicinal applications, which include anti-angiogenic activity through inhibition of human type 2 methionine aminopeptidase (MetAP-2) and potential use for treatment of amebiasis and microsporidiosis.107–110Fumagillin is a meroterpenoid that possesses a highly-oxygenated cyclohexane ring esterified with a decatetraenedioic acid. Interestingly, although the total synthesis of fumagillin has been well-studied,111,112its biosynthetic pathway had not been elucidated. Researchers therefore examined SM clusters harboring genes encoding HR-PKSs inA. fumigatus, and identified a candidate cluster containing genes encoding MetAP-2 and a type 1 MetAP, which they hypothesized might be involved in self-resistance against fumgaillin.113To confirm that this cluster was responsible for fumagillin production, the cluster's HR-PKS, designatedfma-PKS, was deleted, which resulted in complete elimination of fumagillin production.In vitroassays were used to decipher the functions of other enzymes encoded within thefmacluster, which enabled the biosynthetic pathway of fumagillin to be proposed (Scheme 18). Biosynthesis of the terpenoid portion of the carbon backbone involves initial generation of farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), which is converted to sesquiterpene β-trans-bergamotene by the terpene cyclasefma-TC, which then undergoes two rounds of epoxidation, dihydroxylation, andO-methylation to yield fumagillol. In parallel, the HR-PKSfma-PKS biosynthesizes the polyketide product, which is then combined with fumagillol in a reaction catalyzed byfma-AT. The intermediate's terminal alkene is then epoxidated, followed by hydrolysis to yield a vicinal diol, followed by cleavage to yield an aldehyde, and oxidation to generate fumagillin. Scheme 18. Biosynthesis of fumagillin inA. fumigatus.113. 5. Genetic characterization of secondary metabolites inAspergillus niger To identify the biosynthetic gene cluster responsible for biosynthesis of the bicoumarin kotanin inA. niger, scientists searched for gene clusters containing NR-PKS genes, since formation of the monomeric coumarin does not require any reduction steps.114The candidate clusters were further narrowed down to include only clusters harboring cytochrome P450 or monooxygenases, which would be required for kotanin production. The NR-PKS required for kotanin biosynthesis was confirmed to be KtnS through targeted gene deletion, which led to complete loss of coumarin production. The functions of the other genes within the cluster were investigated using targeted gene deletions, which confirmed the involvement of theO-methyltransferase KtnB and the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase KtnC in kotanin biosynthesis, and allowed the biosynthetic pathway for kotanin to be proposed (Scheme 19). The pathway is initially catalyzed by KtnS to synthesize the pentaketidic dihydroxycoumarin, followed byO-methylation by KtnB to yield a siderin derivative. Next, KtnC catalyzes an oxidative phenol coupling reaction while controlling regio- and stereoselectivity to generateP-(+)-orlandin. Docking experiments were performed to explore the mechanism of regio- and stereoselectivity, which revealed that it is likely dependent on substrate orientation in the active site of KtnC.114P-(+)-kotanin is then generated followingO-methylation ofP-(+)-orlandin. Scheme 19. Biosynthesis of kotanin inA. niger.114. 5.2. Biosynthesis of azanigerones Although many SM gene clusters contain only one encoding PKS, others contain two that can either work in sequence or in convergence to biosynthesize the polyketide product.44,115,116When two PKS enzymes work in sequence, the polyketide chain biosynthesized from the first PKS is transferred to the second PKS, which continues the chain elongation process. Two PKSs working in convergence function independently of one another, and the polyketide products generated from each enzyme are ultimately connected by other pathway enzymes. To explore similar PKS–PKS partnerships inA. niger, researchers overexpressed a pathway-specific transcription factor that was present in a cluster that also harbored the NR-PKS AzaA and the HR-PKS AzaB, which led to the production of previously unknown azaphilone SMs.117Azaphilones are a class of compounds that consist of a highly-oxygenated bicyclic core and a chiral quaternary center.118They are structurally diverse and feature a wide range of bioactivities, including antimicrobial, antifungal, antiviral, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, cytotoxic, and nematicidal properties.118The most abundant azaphilone produced in the overexpression strain was designated as azanigerone A. Other related compounds were produced at earlier time points, including FK17-P2a and azanigerones B and C, and azanigerone D was observed to replace azanigerone A at later time points. To further explore the mechanism of collaboration between NR-PKS AzaA and HR-PKS AzaB in azanigerone biosynthesis, anazaB-deletion strain was generated, which upon culturing led to the accumulation of two new compounds, designated as azanigerones E and F. This suggests a convergence biosynthesis model, in which AzaA and AzaB biosynthesize two discrete polyketide products which are combined at later step in the pathway. Interestingly, this is the first report of convergent collaboration between an NR-PKS and a HR-PKS in SM biosynthesis. These findings, combined with subsequentin vitroexperiments to confirm the role of tailoring enzyme AzaH, enabled scientists to propose a pathway for azaphilone biosynthesis inA. niger(Scheme 20). The NR-PKS AzaA catalyzes biosynthesis of a hexaketide precursor, which then undergoes a terminal ketone reduction catalyzed by the ketoreductase AzaE to yield FK17-P2a. Next, the monooxygenase AzaH hydroxylates FK17-P2a, which facilitates formation of the pyran-ring and generation of azanigerone E. In parallel, the HR-PKS AzaB biosynthesizes a 2,4-dimethylhexanoyl chain, which is combined with FK17-P2a to generate azanigerone B in a reaction facilitated by the acyltransferase AzaD. Next, azanigerone B is hydroxylated by FAD-dependent monooxygenase AzaG or AzaL to yield azanigerone C, followed by C–C oxidative cleavage by cytochrome P450 AzaI, and oxidation of the aldehyde to a carboxylic acid by AzaJ, yielding azanigerone A. Azanigerone A can then undergo addition of NH3to generate azanigerone D, which was observed to replace azanigerone A production at later time points. Scheme 20. Biosynthesis of azanigerones inA. niger.117. 5.3. Biosynthesis of yanuthone D The yanuthones comprise a group of SMs that feature an epoxylated six-member ring with a sesquiterpene and two other varying side chains.119The core structure of yanuthones can be derived from the polyketide 6-methylsalicylic acid (6-MSA), which are distinguished as class I yanuthones, or from an unknown precursor that generates a C6-core scaffold, which are distinguished as class II yanuthones.120The class I yanuthone, yanuthone D, has displayed potent antimicrobial activity againstCandida albicans, methicillin-resistantS. aureus, and vancomycin-resistantEnterococcus.119,121To investigate the capacity ofA. nigerto produce 6-MSA-derived SMs, theA. nigerPKS-encoding YanA was heterologously expressed inA. nidulansto confirm its involvement in the biosynthesis of the polyketide 6-MSA.121To identify the final SM product of the 10-geneyancluster, ayanA-deletion strain was generated and screened on various media, which revealed a loss of production of two SMs that were identified as yanuthones D and E. The biosynthetic pathway of yanuthone D was further investigated by individually deleting genes within theyancluster which resulted in the accumulation of yanuthone intermediates, and enabled a biosynthetic pathway to be proposed (Scheme 21). The pathway initiates with the biosynthesis of 6-MSA by the PKS YanA, followed by decarboxylation by YanB, and hydroxylation by the cytochrome P450 YanC, yielding toluquinol. Epoxide formation is then catalyzed by YanD and/or YanE, followed by prenylation by YanG to form 7-deacetoxyyanuthone A. Next, cytochrome P450 YanH catalyzes conversion to 22-deacetylyanuthone A, followed by conversion to yanuthone E by theO-mevalon transferase YanI. Interestingly, this is the first time thatO-mevalon transferase activity has been molecularly characterized. Lastly, the oxidase YanF catalyzes the formation of yanuthone D from yanuthone E. Scheme 21. Biosynthesis of yanuthone D inA. niger.121. 5.4. Biosynthesis of the pyranonigrins The pyranonigrins are a group of compounds produced byA. nigerwith 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging antioxidant activity.20,122Thepyngene cluster was activated by introducing a plasmid containing the pathway-specific Zn2Cys6transcriptional regulatorpynRunder control of the arginase (aga) promoter.123Cluster activation resulted in induced transcription of PKS–NRPS-encodingpynA, FAD-dependent oxidoreductase-encodingpynB,N-methyltransferase-encodingpynC, cytochrome P450 oxidase-encodingpynD, and NAD-binding protein-encodingpynE, along with production of the SM pyranonigrin E. In a subsequent study, thepyncluster was activated by replacing thepynRpromoter with the robustglaApromoter,124and the biosynthetic pathway of pyranonigrin E was investigated using cluster gene deletion mutants in combination within vivoandin vitroassays.125Researchers identified three additionalpyncluster genes, including flavin-dependent oxidase-encodingpynG, aspartase protease-encodingpynH, and thioesterase-encodingpynI. The proposed biosynthetic pathway initiates with biosynthesis of the polyketide–nonribosomal peptide hybrid product by PynA, followed by release of the intermediate from PynA by PynI, generating pyranonigrin J (Scheme 22). Next PynC catalyzesN-methylation of pyranonigin J, followed by epoxidation by PynG, which facilitates the subsequent ring closure. PynD and PynH then catalyze the formation of pyranonigrin E, which can then dimerize to form pyranonigrin F. Alternatively, PynE can catalyze the conversion of pyranonigrin E to pyranonigrin G, which can be reversed by the PynB. Scheme 22. Biosynthesis of pyranonigrins E–J inA. niger.123,125. The potent antioxidant pyranonigrin A, whose production was previously reported inA. niger,126,127was found to be biosynthesized by a PKS–NRPS gene cluster different from thepyncluster.128The biosynthetic pathway of pyranonigrin A, which was elucidated inPenicillium thymicola, involves initial biosynthesis of the polyketide–nonribosomal peptide product by the PKS–NRPS PyrA, followed by product release catalyzed by either a Dieckmann cyclase (DKC) and/or the hydrolase PyrD (Scheme 23). Next, FAD-binding monooxygenase PyrC may catalyze epoxidation followed by subsequent ring closure to form the pyrano[2,3-c]pyrrole core, followed by conversion to pyranonigrin S and pyranonigrin A by cytochrome P450 PyrB. Scheme 23. Biosynthesis of pyranonigrin A inA. niger.128. 6. Genetic characterization of secondary metabolites inAspergillus terreus 6.1. Biosynthesis of aspterric acid The gene cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of the potent herbicide aspterric acid was identified using a resistance-gene-directed approach.134Scientists focused on identifying SMs that would target the dihydroxyacid dehydratase (DHAD) enzyme within the branched chain amino acid (BCAA) biosynthetic pathway, which is necessary for plant growth and considered a specific target for weed-control agents.135They reasoned that gene clusters responsible for biosynthesis of a DHAD inhibitor may also include a self-resistance gene, such as an additional copy of DHAD that is not sensitive to the produced inhibitor. Such a cluster was identified inA. terreus, which included genes encoding the sesquiterpene cyclase AstA, cytochrome P450 enzymes AstB and AstC, and a homolog of DHAD AstD. Interestingly, this cluster is conserved across multiple fungal genomes, includingNeosartorya fischeriNRRL 181,Penicillium brasilianum, andPenicillium solitumstrain RS1.134To activate the silent gene cluster,astA,astB, andastCwere heterologously expressed stepwise inSaccharomyces cerevisiaeRC01, which resulted in the production of the sesquiterpenoid aspterric acid and its biosynthetic intermediates, and enabled researchers to propose the biosynthetic pathway for aspterric acid (Scheme 24). Its biosynthesis initiates with the cyclization of farnesyl diphosphate by AstA to yield (–)-daucane, followed by AstB-catalyzed oxidation to convert a methyl group to a carboxylic acid and form an epoxide. Next, the oxidation of a methyl group by AstC yields an alcohol, which facilitates an intramolecular epoxide opening to generate aspterric acid. Aspterric acid was found to inhibit DHAD at sub-micromolar levels, highlighting its capacity for use as a potent herbicidal agent. Additionally, the ability of the DHAD AstD to confer self-resistance to aspterric acid was confirmed. Scheme 24. Biosynthesis of aspterric acid inA. terreus.134. 6.2. Biosynthesis of phenguignardic acid The NRPS-like-encoding genepgnAwas activated inA. terreususing a doxycycline-dependent inducible Tet-on expression system that had previously been developed for the activation of genes inA. niger.104,136The system involvesgdpA-mediated constitutive expression of the doxycycline-dependent transcriptional activator rtTA fused totetO7sites and a Pmin promoter sequence that precedes the target gene. In the presence of doxycycline, rtRA binds totetO7-Pmin and activates transcription of the target gene. The study revealed that activation of thepgnAresulted in the production of phenguignardic acid,136which has displayed non-host-specific phytotoxic activity.137Heterologous expression inA. nidulansconfirmed that PgnA is independently responsible for phenguignardic acid production (Scheme 25). Scheme 25. Biosynthesis of phenguignardic acid inA. terreus.136. 6.3. Biosynthesis of asperphenamate The amino acid ester asperphenamate and its derivatives have displayed potent activity against breast cancer cell lines.138,139The structure of asperphenamate consists ofN-benzoylphenylalanine andN-benzoylphenylalaninol subunits, which are linked together by an ester. Its bioactivity and rare structure prompted the molecular characterization of asperphenamate. Targeted gene deletions in asperphenamate-producingPenicillium brevicompactumconfirmed that theapmcluster, which harbors two NRPSs and is conserved across the genomes ofA. terreusandAspergillus aculeatus, is responsible for asperphenamate biosynthesis.140The biosynthetic pathway of asperphenamate was elucidated by examining the production of biosynthetic intermediates in deletion strains and by conducting feeding studies in heterologous hosts. This study confirmed that NRPSs ApmA and ApmB are sufficient for biosynthesis of asperphenamate, despite the presence of potential tailoring enzymes within the cluster (Scheme 26). First, ApmA biosynthesizes an amide intermediate from phenylalanine and benzoic acid precursors. ApmB activates the same substrates and accepts the ApmA-biosynthesized linear dipeptidyl precursor, which are combined through inter-molecular ester bond formation to generate asperphenamate. Interestingly, this was the first study to reveal a two-module NRPS system responsible for the biosynthesis of an amino acid ester. Scheme 26. Biosynthesis of asperphenamate inA. terreus.140. 6.4. Biosynthesis of citreoviridin Citreoviridin is an ATP synthase inhibitor that has been investigated as a therapeutic agent to target breast cancer.141To identify its biosynthetic gene cluster inA. terreus, a resistance-gene-driven approach was utilized.142One such cluster contained the F1-ATPase β-chain-encoding CtvE, which is a subunit of the target of citreoviridin, along with genes encoding the HR-PKS CtvA, the SAM-dependent methyltransferase CtvB, the flavin-dependent monooxygenase CtvC, and the hydrolase CtvD. To investigate the biosynthetic pathway of citreoviridin, the genes within thectvcluster were heterologously expressed stepwise inA. nidulans, which resulted in the production of intermediates and allowed a biosynthetic pathway to be proposed (Scheme 27). CtvA first biosynthesizes an α-pyrone intermediate, which undergoes hydroxyl group methylation by CtvB to yield citreomontanin. Next, the citreomontanin terminal alkenes undergo isomerization to form a (17Z)-hexaene, which is bisepoxidated by CtvC. CtvD then catalyzes formation of the tetrahydrofuran ring, resulting in citreoviridin production. Scheme 27. Biosynthesis of citreoviridin inA. terreus.142. In the post-genomic era, fungal sequencing initiatives have accelerated our ability to link SMs to their biosynthetic gene clusters. Further, they have enhanced our understanding of fungal SM biosynthetic processes and the underpinning genes that define them. Such knowledge can have enormous applications for pharmaceutical production and industrial processes, as genetic engineering can be used to optimize SM production levels or to generate useful second-generation analogs. Despite the significant progress made in the past six years, many SMs thatAspergillusspecies have the capacity to produce still have not been identified or linked to their biosynthetic gene clusters, which remains true for many other fungal species. Thorough characterization of theAspergillussecondary metabolome will require a combination of approaches, including the use of inducible promoters, overexpression of pathway-specific regulators, growth in various conditions, heterologous expression, and gene knockout techniques, along with the collaborative effort of the research community.
