Ferl,robferl@ufl.edu This article was submitted to Plant Abiotic Stress, a section of the journal Frontiers in Plant Science Received 2021 Apr 7; Accepted 2021 Aug 12; Collection date 2021. Plants cope with environmental changes by reprogramming gene expression and metabolic processes necessary for growth, development, and survival (e.g.,Hirayama and Shinozaki, 2010;Sewelam et al., 2014;Lopez-Ruiz et al., 2020). The adaptability of a genotype to changing environmental conditions is therefore determined by its genome and gene activity, both of which are in turn influenced by epigenetic factors such as DNA methylation (e.g.,Dowen et al., 2012;Zhang et al., 2018). The APEX-04 EPEX spaceflight experiment investigated the role of specific epigenomic changes in determining the physiological adaptation of plants to the spaceflight environment. DNA methylation profiles within a genome are dynamic and complex, yet integral to plant growth, development, and stress responses (reviewed in:Bartels et al., 2018). Many terrestrial abiotic stresses, such as salt stress, heat stress, drought, water stress, and phosphate starvation induce epigenetic changes that aid in the adaptation process (e.g.,Labra et al., 2002;Boyko and Kovalchuk, 2010;Mirouze and Paszkowski, 2011;Bilichak et al., 2012;Colaneri and Jones, 2013;Tricker et al., 2013;Yong-Villalobos et al., 2015,2016;Hewezi et al., 2017,2018;Bartels et al., 2018;Kenchanmane Raju et al., 2018;Beyrne et al., 2019;Ashapkin et al., 2020;Akhter et al., 2021;Korotko et al., 2021;Laanen et al., 2021;Villagomez-Aranda et al., 2021). The genes differentially expressed in response to spaceflight share similarities with many documented terrestrial responses. Hallmarks of spaceflight responses include differential expression of genes involved in pathways associated with cell wall remodeling, reactive oxygen species (ROS), pathogen attacks, wounding, salt stress, drought stress, and hormone signaling (Hoson et al., 2002;Gao et al., 2008;Salmi and Roux, 2008;Blancaflor, 2013;Correll et al., 2013;Paul et al., 2013;Zupanska et al., 2013;Ferl et al., 2014;Inglis et al., 2014;Nakashima et al., 2014;Sugimoto et al., 2014;Kwon et al., 2015;Schüler et al., 2015;Zhang et al., 2015;Ferl and Paul, 2016;Herranz et al., 2019;Vandenbrink et al., 2019;Barker et al., 2020;Califar et al., 2020;Kruse et al., 2020;Angelos et al., 2021;Manian et al., 2021b). Plants further respond to spaceflight with changes in DNA methylation, again similarly to the epigenetic effects that occur during terrestrial stresses. Genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression alterations occurred in plants grown for part of their life cycle in a satellite experiment (Xu et al., 2018). Arabidopsis grown from seed on orbit in the International Space Station (ISS) showed changes in specific DNA methylation contexts, with some of those changes associated with differentially expressed genes (DEGs;Zhou et al., 2019). The patterns of spaceflight-associated DNA methylation are organ-specific. In comparison to roots, spaceflight leaves show higher methylation levels within the protein-coding genes compared to ground controls (GCs;Zhou et al., 2019). A large proportion of the genes that are differentially expressed and differentially methylated are associated with ROS signaling (Zhou et al., 2019). ROS can act as signaling molecules in responses to an array of plant stressors and there is growing evidence of an interplay between ROS metabolism and epigenetic regulation during acclimation in terrestrial environments (Huang et al., 2019). DNA methylation and other epigenetic modifications have been reported to play a role in regulating the innate immune response and pathogen response (Dowen et al., 2012;Wang et al., 2013;Yu et al., 2013;Tameshige et al., 2015;Jarosz et al., 2020). Many components of the gene networks associated with these pathogen-associated pathways are also differentially expressed by plants in spaceflight (Correll et al., 2013;Paul et al., 2013,2017;Sugimoto et al., 2014;Kwon et al., 2015;Schüler et al., 2015;Herranz et al., 2019;Barker et al., 2020;Califar et al., 2020;Manian et al., 2021a). This commonality of terrestrial environmental responses with spaceflight responses begged the question: do plants use similar tools to regulate genes in response to spaceflight? DNA methylation in plants occurs in three main contexts, CG, CHG, and CHH (where H = A, C, or T). Methylation in each context is directly maintained by a distinct pathway and set of enzymes which include: Methyltransferase 1 (MET1), decreased DNA methylation 1 (DDM1)1, and variant in methylation in the CG context, SUVH4-deposited H3K9me2 and CHROMOMETHYLASE 3 (CMT3) in the CHG context, and CMT2 in the CHH context (Chevalier et al., 2005;Hsieh et al., 2012;Pikaard, 2013). In addition to these direct enzymatic regulators of DNA methylation, a number of genes indirectly affect DNA methylation through RNA intermediates. RNA-directed DNA methylation facilitates the recruitment of DNA methyltransferases. In plants, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) directde novoDNA methylation and maintenance of DNA methylation at asymmetrical CHH sites through the polymerase II (Pol II)-related RNA polymerases Pol IV and Pol V (Matzke et al., 2015). In Arabidopsis, the siRNA effector ARGONAUTE4 (AGO4) exists in a complex with domains rearranged methyltransferase (DRM) for methylation of the template strand for RNA polymerase V-mediated non-coding RNA transcripts (Zhong et al., 2014). The Elongator complex is a co-factor of RNA Pol II, and ELP2 is the most likely subunit to interact with the siRNA machinery (Woloszynska et al., 2016). To explore the effects of these two DNA methylation pathways in conditioning the spaceflight response, we chose MET1 as a representative of the proteins directly involved in methylation and ELP2 as a model regulator that affects methylation during stress responses through RNA intermediates and regulation of methyltransferases. The Elongator complex is composed of six protein subunits that are highly conserved among eukaryotes; it acts as a co-factor of RNA Pol II, and has several unique cellular functions, including tRNA modification, DNA modification, and histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity (Nelissen et al., 2005;Glatt and Muller, 2013;Ding and Mou, 2015;Kolaj-Robin and Seraphin, 2017). Although loss of any component can compromise Elongator complex function (Ding and Mou, 2015) the subunits have independent activity and can also function as sub-complexes (e.g.,Glatt and Muller, 2013;Jarosz et al., 2020). Elongator proteins were initially identified in plants as important to various aspects of growth, development, and immune response (Woloszynska et al., 2016). Elongator Proteins ELP3 and ELP2 both contribute epigenomic regulation of gene expression in response to developmental and immune response pathways in Arabidopsis. ELP3 exhibits HAT activity while ELP2 interacts with components of the siRNA machinery (Woloszynska et al., 2016). In plants, siRNAs can induce cytosine methylation by recruitment of the DNA methyl transferase DRM2 through RNA-directed DNA methylation (e.g.,Xie and Yu, 2015), and it is by this mode of action that ELP2 regulates plant development and stress responses (reviewed in:Jarosz et al., 2020). ELP2 is associated with terrestrial pathogen responses (e.g.,Wang et al., 2013) and plays a role in root development (e.g.,Jia et al., 2015), The role of ELP2 in plant pathogen defense is relevant to the spaceflight response in plants as many of the genes comprising the spaceflight transcriptome are also commonly associated with terrestrial pathogen responses (e.g.,Paul et al., 2013,2017;Zhou et al., 2019;Barker et al., 2020). Functionally, ELP2 is a regulator of NONEXPRESSOR OF PATHOGENESIS-RELATED GENES 1 (NPR1) and accelerates the immune responses in Arabidopsis through epigenetic modification of DNA methylation (DeFraia et al., 2010;Wang et al., 2013;Silva et al., 2017). Deletion of the gene encoding ELP2 has substantial impact on pathogen-induced transcription (DeFraia et al., 2010;Wang et al., 2013;Silva et al., 2017), and also impacts fundamental processes such as root development (Jia et al., 2015) and auxin signaling (Nelissen et al., 2010). Many of the genes differentially expressed betweenelp2mutants and wild-type plants include hallmarks of abiotic stress responses (Zhou et al., 2009). Further, many of the genes differentially expressed inelp2mutants are also represented in Arabidopsis spaceflight transcriptomes and spaceflight methylome (e.g.,Paul et al., 2013,2017;Zhou et al., 2019). These roles for ELP2 in pathogen responses and abiotic stresses suggest that ELP2 may also play a role in the epigenetic regulation of the spaceflight response pathways in plants. Plant Material and Experimental Design Three lines ofArabidopsis thaliana(Arabidopsis) were used: Columbia-0 (Col-0) wild-type (TAIR CS70000), and Col-0 mutantsmet1-7andelp2-5genotype. Mutantsmet1-7andelp2-5previously described inKanno et al. (2008),Guo et al. (2013),Wang et al. (2013), and were kindly provided by Dr. Zhonglin Mou (Wang et al., 2013). Sterilized seeds from each line were sown aseptically onto Petri dishes (100 mm × 15 mm; Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, United States), containing 50 mL of a 0.5% Phytagel-based growth medium supplemented with: 0.5 × Murashige–Skoog salts, 0.5% (w/v) sucrose, and 1 × Gamborg’s Vitamin Mixture, and then sealed with breathable tape (3M Micropore®, Maplewood, MN, United States; e.g.,Califar et al., 2020). Seeded plates were prepared to maintain seed dormancy with a combination of far-red light treatment and light-tight wrapping in DuvetyneTMcloth until insertion into Veggie growth facility on orbit. Dormancy preparation details described inSng et al. (2014),Fitzgerald et al. (2016),Califar et al. (2020). Ten plates (nine for installation in Veggie and one spare) per genotype for each environmental condition (flight and GC) were prepared for launch. The plates were stored at 4°C and remained dormant until their installation into the Vegetable Production System (Veggie) hardware on the ISS, and a comparable set was installed into the Veggie hardware in the ISS environmental simulator (ISSES) chamber at Kennedy space center. Plants in the Veggie hardware (both on the ISS and in the ISSES chamber) were exposed to constant light conditions of 100–135 μmoles/m2s PAR for 11 days before being harvested into Kennedy space center fixation tubes (KFTs) and fixed in RNAlaterTM(Ambion, Grand Island, NY, United States). All of the plants from each plate were harvested into individual KFTs. The KFTs were then stowed at −80°C in the MELFI freezer aboard the ISS. The comparable GC samples were also harvested into KFTs and stored in a standard −80°C freezer. All samples were kept frozen until delivery to the laboratory for analysis. Each plate was intended as a biological replicate and kept separate in tissue preparation operations, but the mass values drove the decision to allow a combination of two plates to comprise a replicate, which resulted in a total of four biological replicates for each of the genotypes and treatments for the analyses. Leaf and root tissues from each sample were dissected using an Olympus stereo-microscope. FromBioanalyzer and quantified with the each plate, the materials from three individual plants were pooled for RNA extraction and transcriptome analyses, and materials from 10 to 15 individual plants from that same plate were allocated for DNA extraction. Molecular analyses were performed on leaf and root tissues dissected from each of the three genotypes. One plate was lost, (met1-7, spaceflight C6) and so one of the spaceflightmet1-7replicates was composed of plants from a single plate rather than two plates. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) was performed for the methylome analysis and RNA sequencing (RNASeq) for the transcriptome analysis. To summarize, for each genotype under each environmental condition, a total seven (spaceflightmet1-7) or eight (all other genotypes and treatments) plates were used to conduct WGBS and RNASeq analyses, four biological replicates for each assay. Experiment Operations for Spaceflight and Ground Controls Genomic DNA Isolation and Whole-Genome Bisulfite Sequencing Library Preparation DNA extraction was done using a modified phenol/chloroform protocol (LeFrois et al., 2016) and genome-wide bisulfite sequencing was performed using a similar procedure as that described byWang et al. (2013),Zhou et al. (2019). Briefly, 700–1,700 ng of genomic DNA (>5 Kb in length) observed on the TapeStation Genomic Screen Tape (Agilent) was processed for sequencing library construction. DNA was transferred into 6 × 16 mm glass microtubes with AFA fiber and pre-slit snap caps (Cat# 520045, Covaris, Inc.) and sheared into an average fragment size of ∼400 bp using the Covaris S220 ultrasonic disruptor. Short DNA fragments (<100 bp) were removed using AMPure magnetic beads (Cat# A63881, Beckman Coulter) at a 1:1 bead to sample ratio. 100–250 ng of clean, fragmented DNA was used for the Illumina sequencing library construction. Both the NEBNext®UltraTMII DNA Illumina construction kit (Cat# E7645S, NEB) and the Illumina-specific methylated and dual-index barcoded adaptors (Cat# E7600S NEB) were used as described in the manufacturer’s guidelines. Illumina libraries (containing methylated adaptors) were subjected to sodium bisulfite treatment using the EZ DNA Methylation Direct kit (ZYMO Research, Cat #D5020) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The resulting libraries were enriched by a 13–15 cycle amplification using a uracil-insensitive polymerase (EpiMark hot start Taq polymerase, NEB, Cat #M0490S). The amplified library products were separated on a 2% agarose gel from which library fragments in the 250–500 bp range were excised (QIAquick gel extraction kit, Cat# 28704, QIAGEN) and AMPure purified (Cat# A63881, Beckman Coulter). Gel staining was done with SYBR Safe (Life Technologies) and visualized on a blue light transilluminator (Life Technologies) to avoid UV damage to the DNA. The final libraries were quantified by the RNA concentration was determined on Qubit®2.0 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher/Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, United States), sized on the Agilent TapeStation (DNA5000 Screen Tape) and by qPCR with the Kapa SYBR Fast qPCR reagents (Cat# KK4824, Kapa Biosystems) with monitoring on an ABI7900HT real-time PCR system (LifeTechnologies). The average library size was 350 bp. Care was taken to generate WGBS libraries that were approximately the same size as the RNASeq libraries. Sequencing was performed at the ICBR NextGen Sequencing Core1. Total RNA Isolation and RNASeq Library Construction RNA extraction was performed using RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. RNA concentration was determined on a Qubit®2.0 Fluorometer, RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Inc.). The RIN numbers of the total RNA used for RNASeq library construction are between 7.1 and 9.3. Basically, 2 μL of 1:200 diluted RNA spike-in ERCC (half amount of suggested in the ERCC user guide: Cat# 4456740) spike to 1,000 ng of total RNA followed by mRNA isolated using the NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module (New England Biolabs, catalog # E7490). This was followed by RNA library construction with the NEBNext Ultra Directional RNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs, catalog #E7420) according to the manufacturer’s user guide. Briefly, RNA was fragmented in NEBNext First Strand Synthesis Buffer via incubation at 94°C for the desired time. This step was followed by first-strand cDNA synthesis using reverse transcriptase and Oligo(dT) primers. Synthesis of ds-cDNA was performed using the second strand master mix provided in the kit, followed by end-repair and adaptor ligation. At this point, Illumina adaptors were ligated to the sample. Finally, each library (uniquely barcoded) was enriched by 10 cycles of amplification, and purified with Agencourt AMPure beads (Beckman Coulter, catalog # A63881). 48 barcoded libraries were sized on the Bioanalyzer and quantified with the Qubit®2.0 Fluorometer. Finally, these 48 individual libraries were pooled in equimolar concentration. RNASeq libraries were constructed at the UF ICBR Gene Expression Core2. HiSeq3000 Procedure, Pooled RNASeq, and MethylSeq Uniquely barcoded libraries were normalized to 2.5 nM and pooled (equimolarly) for sequencing on the HiSeq3000 Illumina sequencer. Bisulfite-converted sequencing libraries were sequenced together with RNASeq libraries (uniquely barcoded) to maximize data output. The RNASeq libraries in the pool served to compensate for the low base diversity of bisulfite-converted genomic libraries. The final library was created by mixing RNASeq vs bisulfite-converted libraries at a 60:40% ratio, with a mere 1% PhiX spike-in. Library pools were processed according to the Illumina protocol (HiSeq3000) for clustering on the cBOT machine. After denaturation, neutralization, and mixing with the ExAmp reagent, the final pool concentration for clustering was 0.25 nM. Sequencing was done using a 2 × 101 cycles format (paired-end configuration). The 48-sample project was sequenced on 12 lanes for a robust reads/lane output. The short reads from the uniquely barcoded bisulfite-converted genomic libraries were trimmed using Trimmomatic v 0.36 and quality control on the original and trimmed reads was performed using FastQC v 0.11.4 and MultiQC v 1.1 (Andrews, 2010;Bolger et al., 2014;Ewels et al., 2016). The bisulfite-converted reads were aligned to the TAIR10 genome using BSMAP (Xi and Li, 2009). Methylation calling was performed with CSCALL and the differential methylation analysis was performed using the MCOMP program, which is part of the MOABS package (Abe et al., 1997;Sun et al., 2014). Cytosine sites with at least a 10x read coverage in at least two out of the four replicates were included in downstream analyses. Methylated cytosine sites for which thep-value of the difference between test and control methylation rates was below 0.01 were considered differentially methylated cytosines (DmCs). In addition, DmCs with a methylation difference > 0 were classified as hypermethylated whereas those < 0 were classified as hypomethylated. DmCs were also categorized based on the characteristics of their genomic locations including the gene body (from transcriptional start site to transcriptional termination site), promoter (2 kb upstream of transcriptional start site), and downstream (2 kb downstream of transcriptional termination site). Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were defined following the method described inStroud et al. (2013). Briefly, DMRs were determined by comparing the average methylation levels within a 100 bp window between spaceflight and GCs, and those with statistical significance (p< 0.01) were used in the analysis. The reads mapped to the chloroplast reference genome were used to calculate the bisulfite conversion efficiency as previously described (Zhou et al., 2019). The overall quality of the RNASeq sequence data was first evaluated using FastQC (Andrews, 2010,2018). Low-quality bases were trimmed from the reads using Trimmomatic (Bolger et al., 2014). STAR Aligner was used to map high-quality paired-end reads to TAIR10 genome (Vandenbrink et al., 2016). Gene expression values were calculated from these alignments using RSEM (Li and Dewey, 2011). The expected read counts and fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM) were extracted for further analysis. A generalized linear regression model was built to perform the differential gene analysis using edgeR (Robinson et al., 2010). Prior to the differential expression analysis, hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis (PCA) were conducted to identify potential outliers in the samples. The thresholds for calling significantly DEG were set at, FDR of 0.05, a fold change of greater than 2, and the average FPKM for at least one replicate of each comparison group being higher than 0. DEG lists were analyzed for overlaps using BioVenn (Hulsen et al., 2008). Processing and Analysis of the RNASeq data was performed at the UF ICBR Bioinformatics Core3. Functional Categories Enrichment Arabidopsis thalianagene IDs from each list of differentially methylated, differentially expressed genes (DmC-DEGs) output from combined methylomic and transcriptomic data were submitted to g:Profiler using the standard parameters (Raudvere et al., 2019). Lists of gene ontology (GO) terms enriched within each group of DmC-DEGs were trimmed using REVIGO (Supek et al., 2011). Original Student’st-tests were done with Bonferroni corrections. Two-Factor ANOVA analyses with replication were performed to demonstrate statistical differences in methylation levels between genotypes and plant organ samples. Col-0 andmet1-7Exhibited a Typical Spaceflight Growth Morphology, Whileelp2-5Displayed an Unusual Spaceflight Morphology Spaceflight Increased Genome-Wide DNA Methylation Levels inmet1-7andelp2-5but Not in the Wild-Type Col-0 Plants In the GC plant leaves, the methylation level ofmet1-7was statistically lower than that of Col-0 andelp2-5plants in all three methylation contexts. Col-0 andelp2-5and plants showed similar genome-wide methylation levels (Figures 2A,B). In the GC plant roots, the methylation level ofmet1-7was statistically lower than that of Col-0 andelp2-5plants in the CG and CHG contexts. In the CHH context, there were no statistical differences in methylation among genotypes. Average genome-wide methylation level profiles in spaceflight and on the ground.(A–D)A comparison of the average genome-wide methylation levels (CG, CHG, and CHH) across the three genotypes is illustrated in leaves grown on the ground(A), roots grown on the ground(B), leaves grown in spaceflight(C), and roots grown in spaceflight(D). Statistical analyses were performed using two-samplet-test with Bonferroni corrections. Bar graphs with different letters show significant differences (p< 0.01). In addition, Two-Factor ANOVA analyses with replication showed that the relationships between methylation contexts were dependent on the samples (p< 1.0E-10).(E–J)Average genome-wide methylation levels are shown of each genotype (Col-0 wild-type,elp2, andmet1-7) and tissue type (leaves or roots) in spaceflight (FT) and ground controls (GC). Data represent the mean of four independent samples and∗∗indicate significance (p< 0.01, two-samplet-test with Bonferroni corrections) difference between flight and ground controls in each of the methylation contexts (CG, CHG, and CHH). In spaceflight plants, the methylation levels varied greatly in each genotype, methylation context and tissue type. The flightelp2-5plants showed a higher methylation level compared to Col-0 in all methylation contexts in both leaves and roots (Figures 2C,D). The flightmet1-7methylation levels were lower than Col-0 in the CG context in both leaves and roots. However,met1-7showed higher methylation levels than Col-0 in the CHG and CHH contexts in flight leaves while showing similar methylation levels in roots (Figures 2C,D). Spaceflight Changes in DNA Methylation Levels Were Associated With Protein-Coding Gene Regions Pairwise comparison of the average methylation levels across protein-coding genes between the genotypes in CG, CHG, and CHH contexts. Gene bodies from transcription start site (TSS) to transcription termination site (TTS; highlighted by the yellow bar) as well as the flanking upstream 2 kb and downstream 2 kb are shown. Each pairwise comparison between genotypes and environment is denoted by a three-letter code. The first letter denotes the environment [flight, (F) and ground (G)], the second letter denotes the genotype [Col-0 (C),elp2-5(E), andmet1-7(M)], and the third letter denotes the specific tissue [leaves (L) and roots (R)]. Theyaxes indicate the average methylation levels in each of the CG, CHG, and CHH contexts. A pairwise comparison between the various genotypes are depicted here Col-0 vs elp2-5 leaves(A)and roots(C), along with Col-0 vs met1-7 leaves(B)and roots(D).

Negative correlations (−) are defined when up-regulated genes aligned with hypomethylated DmCs and down-regulated genes aligned with hypermethylated DmCs. The converse relationship is indicative of a positive correlation (+). Heatmap of spaceflight (FT) vs ground control (GC) DEGs-DmCs in Col-0,elp2-5, andmet1-7roots. Heat maps show the Log2(Fold-change) of differential gene expression (red: up-regulated and green: down-regulated) and differential DNA methylation (hypermethylation: yellow and hypomethylation: blue) of Col-0,elp2-5, andmet1-7roots in FT compared to GC.

The converse relationship is indicative of a positive correlation (+). While organ-specific differences in the gene expression patterns of various Arabidopsis tissue types (leaves, hypocotyls, roots, and root tips) have been previously reported in spaceflight transcriptomes (Paul et al., 2013,2017;Zhou et al., 2019), themet1-7andelp2-5plant lines each demonstrated a different pattern of organ-specific expression and methylation. A large proportion of the differentially methylated and expressed genes in leaves were observed in Col-0 (59 out of 207) andmet1-7(72 out of 226), whereas in roots a large proportion of differentially methylated and expressed genes were found in Col-0 (114 out of 147) andelp2-5(101 out of 120). Only 8% of the leaf DEGs and 12% of the root DEGs overlap between the genotypes, suggesting that unique organ-specific mechanisms were engaged for spaceflight adaptation, with MET1 playing a more important role in leaves and ELP2 having the more important role in roots, in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight. Genetic factors that influence genome DNA methylation directly impact physiological adaptation to spaceflight, affecting overall growth in space as well as the specifics of the spaceflight gene response profile. Genome methylation is therefore important for spaceflight responses in much the same way as it is important for adaptation to terrestrial stresses. In particular, processes regulated by ELP2 appear critical for proper root directional development in spaceflight. The remodeling of the Arabidopsis methylome in spaceflight, together with the negative outcomes of interfering with DNA methylation, suggests that epigenetic marking is a fundamental part of environmental responses, even during novel environmental stresses outside of the evolutionary history of plants.
