While body and muscle mass may return to normal values within several months upon return weight-bearing [1], weight-bearing bones may not recover even years after returning to normal ambulatory activities [3]. Because of the limited number of space-missions and the invasive nature of many assays, many studies have turned to the well-established rodent hindlimb unloading model (HLU) to investigate the mechanisms by which a single unloading period causes atrophy [4]. However, the impact of repeated exposures to microgravity on many physiologic systems, including the musculoskeleton and body composition, is largely unknown. Decreases in body mass during spaceflight, bedrest, and HLU may occur via losses in adipose and/or lean tissue, and have been attributed to many factors such as decreased caloric intake, dehydration, as well as increased (HLU) or decreased energy expenditure (bedrest) [1,5–8]. During hindlimb unloading, body mass and serum leptin levels, linking energy metabolism to bone mass, can diminish even when caloric intake is adequate [9]. Importantly, after 28 days of HLU, the change in bone formation rates was significantly correlated with the change in serum leptin levels [9]. However, the loss of functional weightbearing also alters the mechanical milieu of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), the pluripotent precursors to numerous cell types including osteoblasts and adipocytes [10–12], which may bias the differentiation of MSCs from an osteogenic to an adipogenic lineage. Whether unloading-induced changes in MSC differentiation result in increased abdominal adipose tissue is not well understood. Further, abdominal adipose tissue is distributed as either subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) or visceral adipose tissue (VAT). While abdominal adipose tissue in general is associated with obesity-related health problems [13], VAT in particular is linked to increased metabolic risk [14–16]. In addition, VAT is lost preferentially over SAT during weight loss [17]. Little is known, however, whether the preferential loss of VAT also occurs in the mouse during hindlimb unloading. Microgravity and HLU also reduce lean tissue mass and muscle size [1], associated with muscle atrophy in postural muscles containing primarily slow-twitch muscle fibers [18,19]. Bone receives mechanical input both from muscle forces as well as from ground reaction forces during gravitational impact [20]. As ground reaction forces are removed during HLU, muscle activity provides the dominant source of mechanical cues [21]. In contrast, ambulatory activities upon release from HLU engage both muscle and impact with the ground, perhaps disassociating muscle and bone recovery. While muscle-bone relations during disuse have been investigated in the hindlimbs [21–23], the extent by which muscle forces maintain vertebral bone is much less understood. And even though bone loss throughout the skeleton environment is site-specific in microgravity [24], it is largely unknown whether the response of the spine to HLU and reambulation (RA) is similar to peripheral skeletal sites [25]. We previously demonstrated in C57BL/6 mice that overall, multiple exposures to hindlimb unloading were more detrimental than a single unloading cycle to both cortical and trabecular bone in the distal femur metaphysis [26]. Nevertheless, the magnitude of bone loss diminished during the second and third unloading cycle. Whether these two phenomena observed in the appendicular skeleton extend to lumbar vertebrae, abdominal lean tissue volume, muscle cross-sectional area, and adipose tissue is unknown. Here, using new data collected during the previous experiment [26], we hypothesized that because of bone’s incomplete ability to recover during RA, multiple unloading cycles would be more detrimental than a single unloading cycle to lumbar apparent bone mineral density. We also hypothesized that previous exposures to unloading will attenuate the response of fat, muscle and bone to subsequent loading cycles. Further, based on associations between serum leptin and bone loss, we hypothesized a positive, linear relationship between bone loss and adipose tissue loss, as well as bone loss and muscle loss. All procedures were approved by the Stony Brook University Animal Care and Use Committee. Forty-four young adult male, sixteen week old C57BL/6J (B6) mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were weighed and randomly assigned to either age-matched controls (control, n = 9) or to single (1x-HLU), double (2x-HLU), or triple (3x-HLU) unloading and reambulation (RA) cycles (n = 11/group). Unloading was achieved by elevating the hindlimbs through tail suspension, simulating the effects of microgravity, including hypokinesia and cephalic fluid-shift [4]. All mice were individually housed and hadad libitumaccess to a standard rodent chow and water during ambulation, HLU, and RA. Hindlimb unloading (HLU) and reambulation (RA) schedule for control, 1x-, 2x-, and 3x-HLU animals. To examine the effects of multiple unloading/reambulation cycles on the final unloading cycle, changes between the beginning (28 wk) and end (30 wk) of the final unloading cycle were compared between groups using a one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s post-hoc test. To examine the effects of multiple unloading/reambulation cycles on recovery, the same tests were used to compare differences between groups following the final reambulation cycle (34 wk) and inex vivomeasurements. Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS Statistics v19 (IBM, Armonk, New York), and p values less than 0.05 were considered significant. Longitudinal changes (mean ± SD) in body mass during the period of interest in this study (weeks 28–34), measured twice weekly. Unloading and reambulation significantly altered body mass:aall HLU groups different from control. Multiple unloading cycles resulted in less change in body mass during this period,c1x-HLU significantly different from 3x-HLU. Loss of Bone, Adipose and Lean Tissue during First, Second, or Third HLU Cycle Longitudinal changes (mean ± SD) in total abdominal tissue volume (mm3), % visceral fat within the abdominal fat, % subcutaneous fat within the abdominal fat measured beginning at 28 wk, corresponding to the final unloading and reambulation cycle. Unloading significantly altered abdominal tissue composition:aall HLU groups different from control. Multiple unloading cycles resulted in less change in abdominal tissue composition during this period:b1x-HLU significantly different from 2x-HLU,c1x-HLU significantly different from 3x-HLU. Longitudinal changes (mean ± SD) in A) % abdominal lean tissue, B) upper hindlimb muscle cross-sectional area (mm2) beginning at 28 wk corresponding to the final unloading and reambulation cycle. Unloading significantly increased the percentage of lean tissue in the abdomen:aall HLU groups different from control; multiple unloading cycles resulted in smaller increases in abdominal lean tissue:b1x-HLU significantly greater than 2x-HLU,c1x-HLU significantly greater than 3x-HLU. In contrast, although the decrease in muscle cross-sectional area during unloading was not significantly different from controls, all unloaded groups had significantly lower muscle cross-sectional area after the final reambulation period. Longitudinal changes (mean ± SD) in lumbar apparent bone mineral density (mgHA/cm3) measured beginning at 28 wk corresponding to the final unloading and reambulation cycle. Unloading caused a significant loss of bone mineral density:aall HLU groups different from control; multiple unloading cycles resulted in smaller losses in vBMD:b1x-HLU significantly different from 2x-HLU. vBMD recovered in all groups after the last reambulation period. Relation between adipose tissue area at wk 28 and loss in adipose tissue during the final unloading cycle in all unloaded animals. Initial level of adipose tissue was a strong predictor of change in adipose tissue (R2= 0.84, p < 0.05). Relation between A) change in adipose tissue area and lumbar vertebral apparent vBMD (R2= 0.34, p < 0.05) and B) change in lean tissue area and lumbar vertebral apparent vBMD during final unloading cycle in all unloaded animals (R2= 0.03, p > 0.05). Recovery of Bone, Adipose and Lean Tissue during First, Second, or Third RA Cycle Effect of Number of Unloading/Reambulation Cycles on Tissue Volume/Mass after last RA Cycle Effect of varying number of unloading/reambulating periods on soleus muscle mass (mg) and fat pad mass (mg) at sacrifice. Values are the mean ± SD. There were no significant differences between groups. Deterioration of the musculoskeleton and changes in abdominal tissue composition have been reported previously for rodents exposed to hindlimb unloading but the effects of multiple exposures are unknown. We found that in male C57BL/6 mice, while the absolute tissue quantity reached during the final unloading cycle was similar regardless of the number of previous unloading cycles, previous exposure to unloading cycles attenuated the change in adipose, lean and bone tissue during the last unloading cycle. Despite considerable losses in both TAT and lumbar apparent vBMD during unloading, four weeks of reambulation were sufficient for complete normalization of these tissues to age-matched controls, irrespective of the number of unloading/reambulation cycles. In contrast, appendicular muscle cross-sectional area was significantly lower in all unloaded groups than in controls at the end of the last reambulation cycle. Further, there was a moderate association between the loss of bone and loss of abdominal adipose tissue, but no association was observed between the loss of abdominal lean tissue and loss of bone. These data demonstrate that diverse tissues can modulate their response to unloading based on their previous unloading history. They also indicate that a tissue’s susceptibility to sustain diminished volume after unloading/reloading cycles is specific to its identity. Ourin vivomeasurements of lumbar vBMD were in agreement with the higher resolutionex vivoassessment of trabecular BV/TV demonstrating an absence of between-group differences after the final reambulation cycle. The recovery of lumbar vertebral trabecular bone micro-architecture within 28 days after a single bout of 14 days of hindlimb unloading [34] has been observed previously, similar to the recovery in histochemical changes observed after 18.5 days of space flight and 29 days post-flight recovery [35]. Together, these data support the hypothesis that the lumbar vertebrae are more capable of recovering during reambulation periods than the peripheral skeleton. While this greater potential for recovery may, at least in part, stem from the lesser overall decline in vertebral bone volume compared to the peripheral sites, differences in the HLU induced mechanical environment between the lumbar spine and the femur may have played a role. In addition, the mechanosensitivity of the lumbar spine may indeed be greater as exercise studies have suggested [36–38]. Further, differences in the resistance to the HLU stress induced actions of glucocorticoids may play a role between the different skeletal sites [39] with the spine being able to more readily regain its morphology once the hormonal stress levels are removed. Similar to single-cycle HLU studies, we observed a decrease in adiposity during HLU [41], contrasting with spaceflight studies that found opposing effects on adipose and lean tissue [1,5]. Within the fat compartment, the preferential reduction in visceral fat over subcutaneous fat is consistent with previous studies. Since visceral adipocytes are more metabolically active than subcutaneous adipocytes, weight-loss related changes in adipose tissue composition show a bias towards visceral fat loss [42,43], irrespective of whether the weight loss is associated with caloric restriction, exercise, or other interventions [17,44]. While the biological roles of VAT and SAT may be different in humans than in rodents [45], SAT remained elevated in the 3x-HLU mice after the final reambulation period. Since health consequences associated with increases in SAT are much less detrimental than VAT, and may even confer protective benefits [46–48], multiple unloading/reambulation cycles may at least not lead to negative modifications in regional adipose tissue. Concomitantly, abdominal lean mass did not change with single or multiple unloading cycles. Hindlimb muscles that are composed primarily of slow-twitch fibers (e.g., soleus) undergo rapid atrophy in response to unloading [18,49] but the effect of hindlimb unloading on the spinal muscles are much less well established. Our µCT based measurement technique of lean body mass in the abdomen included the abdominal organs as well as muscle and may therefore have lacked the required sensitivity to detect small changes in muscle volume. Following the reambulation period, relatively small differences in upper hindlimb muscle cross-sectional area (including the knee flexors and extensors) remained in unloaded groups but there were no inter-group differences in soleus mass. The greater degree of unloading in the hindlimb compared with the abdominal region, as well as the inclusion of internal organs in the measurement of abdominal lean mass may explain the discrepancy between the recovery of these tissues. While atrophy tends to be greater in the plantar flexors and knee extensors following space flight and bed rest [2], direct comparisons are difficult because of the different measurement techniques and more detailed analysis on changes in muscle biology and function during multiple unloading/reloading periods will provide further insight. Further, a longer reambulation period may allow recovery of muscle cross-sectional area as previous hindlimb unloading studies demonstrated that hindlimb muscle mass recovers in rats after 5 weeks of reambulation [50] but not nine days [51]. Unloading significantly reduced lumbar vBMD and adipose tissue Consecutive unloading cycles diminished the rate loss of lumbar vBMD and adipose tissue upon subsequent loading cycles Lumbar vBMD and adipose tissue recovered post-reambulation irrespective of loss Lean tissue volume was less affected by multiple unloading cycles This research was kindly funded by NASA, a Kirchman T32 postdoctoral fellowship from the NIDDK, and NSERC.
