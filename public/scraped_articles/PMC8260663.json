  "content": "Overexpression of catalase in mitochondria mitigates changes in hippocampal cytokine expression following simulated microgravity and isolation Received 2021 Jan 23; Accepted 2021 Jun 11; Collection date 2021. Isolation on Earth can alter physiology and signaling of organs systems, including the central nervous system. Although not in complete solitude, astronauts operate in an isolated environment during spaceflight. In this study, we determined the effects of isolation and simulated microgravity solely or combined, on the inflammatory cytokine milieu of the hippocampus. Adult female wild-type mice underwent simulated microgravity by hindlimb unloading for 30 days in single or social (paired) housing. In hippocampus, simulated microgravity and isolation each regulate a discrete repertoire of cytokines associated with inflammation. Their combined effects are not additive. A model for mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) quenching via targeted overexpression of the human catalase gene to the mitochondria (MCAT mice), are protected from isolation- and/or simulated microgravity-induced changes in cytokine expression. These findings suggest a key role for mitochondrial ROS signaling in neuroinflammatory responses to spaceflight and prolonged bedrest, isolation, and confinement on Earth. Subject terms:Interleukins, Physiology Isolation is an important feature of the spaceflight environment. Interplanetary missions (e.g., trip to Mars) will involve mission crew operating in isolated environments for prolonged periods of time. On Earth, isolation has profound effects on the central nervous system (CNS) including behavioral changes, upregulated oxidative stress pathways, neuroinflammatory responses, as well as brain cytokine alterations1–3. In addition, isolation worsens aging-related cognitive impairments and immune deficits4. Spaceflight also can lead to immune dysfunction as well as reactivation of latent viruses5–8. International Space Station (ISS) crew members on a 6-month spaceflight mission had diminished T/NK cell function9and increased inflammatory plasma cytokine levels10. In shorter duration missions (9–14 days), changes in the distribution and function of peripheral leukocytes were also detected in astronauts11. Further, the subset of astronauts who experienced viral shedding also displayed increased plasma cytokine protein levels in their plasma during flight12, linking dysregulated cytokine levels with impaired immune function. We showed previously that isolation in combination with simulated microgravity by hindlimb unloading (HU) led to a reduction in the percentage of circulating CD4+ immune cells, which was not observed in social housed HU animals13. This finding suggests that isolation can modify immune responses to simulated spaceflight and that the combination of these two spaceflight stressors can lead to discrete immune deficits. However, the combined effects of isolation and microgravity on neuroimmune outcomes are not defined. Excess production of free radicals (e.g., reactive oxygen species, ROS) have been linked to neuroinflammation14. Yet there have been few studies exploring oxidative damage as a mechanism by which space environmental factors, singly or in combination, mediate aspects of CNS immune responses. To address these gaps in knowledge, HU was conducted on paired (social) and single housed wild-type and MCAT mice, a genetic model for mitochondrial ROS quenching. MCAT mice overexpress the human catalase gene targeted to the mitochondria15, a major site of cellular ROS production. MCAT mice display decreased oxidative damage and H2O2production. The MCAT transgenic model15was developed to enable testing various aspects of the free radical theory of aging16, which posits that cells, tissues, and organisms age due to an accumulation of oxidative damage via excess production of ROS. Overexpression of catalase when targeted specifically to the mitochondria, but not when targeted to the nucleus or cytoplasm, prolongs murine lifespan and reduces age-related cardiovascular17–19and cognitive deficits20sharing features with known or anticipated effects of spaceflight21–25. Findings from human astronauts long ago led to the proposal that spaceflight and advancing age share physiological consequences26, leading us to question if they also share molecular mechanisms. Therefore, we determined whether the MCAT transgene also is protective using a ground-based model that simulates important aspects of spaceflight, microgravity, and isolation. MCAT mice show increased median and maximum lifespans (5 months, and 5.5 months, respectively)15and are protected from a number of aging-associated pathologies. For example, MCAT mice display protection from cardiovascular deficits17–19and Alzheimer’s disease-related amyloid deposition27. Further, the brains of MCAT mice indicate the rescue of simulated space radiation-induced decrements in neurogenesis28and neuronal spine morphology29. The overexpression of catalase also quenches mitochondrial oxidative stress in macrophages30, suggesting that catalase can impact oxidative signaling in inflammatory cells. MCAT mice also exhibit enhanced hippocampal spatial learning, memory, and reduced contextual fear conditioning15,20. Altered cognitive function is thought to be one of the risks associated with long-duration spaceflight31. The production of ROS, pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and neurotrophic factors are involved in hippocampal neuropathy. Prolonged exposure to simulated microgravity by HU is associated with increased hippocampal oxidative stress biomarkers, which may increase injury32. Proteomic analysis of the hippocampus in HU mice reveals changes in structural proteins coupled with the loss of proteins involved in cell metabolism33. In addition, microgravity leads to hippocampal-dependent learning and memory impairment in animals34. Cytokines are important mediators of both innate and adaptive immunity. They are produced by resident immune cells in the CNS, peripheral tissues, and in circulation35,36. There is emerging evidence that cytokines contribute to the detrimental effects of isolation triggered by disease or injury37,38. For example, hippocampal expression of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) is significantly increased 24 h after ischemia in isolated mice compared to untreated controls, but not in pair-housed mice37,38. In humans as well as animals, both spaceflight and simulated microgravity (bedrest) can lead to changes in cytokine expression10,12,39–42. Therefore, in this study, we tested the hypothesis that isolation and simulated microgravity lead to altered hippocampal cytokine expression via mitochondrial ROS-related mechanisms. Hippocampal alterations, e.g., oxidative damage, spatial changes, and genetic alterations have been reported in both actual and modeled microgravity32,43–46and linked to behavioral deficits47. These higher CNS functions are critical for astronaut performance during extended periods of spaceflight. Therefore, the hippocampus was selected as the focus of the current study. We found that quenching mitochondrial ROS mitigated the effects of both simulated microgravity and isolation in the hippocampus. Thus, these findings highlight the importance of mitochondrial ROS mechanisms in CNS responses to these stressors, thereby providing a rationale for testing possible use of antioxidants to mitigate CNS risks associated with long-term space exploration as well as bedrest and isolation on Earth. Effects of isolation, microgravity and their combination on hippocampal cytokine levels We performed unbiased hierarchical clustering of cytokine protein expression to gain insight into the impacts of our main experimental variables, loading state (NL: normally loaded or HU), housing environment (single or social housing), and genotype (WT: wild type or MCAT) on the overall cytokine milieu in the hippocampus (Fig.1). At the highest hierarchical level, samples generally clustered by housing conditions (single or social). Samples within the single housed cluster, formed sub-clusters mostly based on genotype (WT or MCAT), which was not observed in the social housed cluster. Loading state (NL or HU) did not appear to contribute to observed clustering of cytokine expression. Fig. 1. Heatmap showing expression of a panel of 44 cytokines in hippocampus and hierarchical clustering analysis of eight experimental groups. Except for a few samples, clustering generally occurred by housing environment (single or social). Deeper shades of red: higher cytokine levels, deeper shades of blue: lower cytokine levels, off-white: no change in expression. Fig. 2.

Assessment of corticosterone levels in plasma Measurements of oxidative damage in hippocampus Changes in cytokine signaling in the CNS have been linked to neuroinflammation, neurocognitive decline, reduced ability to recover from brain injuries as well as neuroprotective effects. For example, genetic deletion of IL-6 leads to reduced exploratory behavior and decreased anxiety59. Deletion of IL-2 in mice leads to cognitive deficits that resemble aspects of Alzheimer’s disease60while disruption of Toll-like receptor signaling by knockout of TLR4 protects against age-related cognitive decline due to neuroinflammation and apoptosis61. Taken together, findings from our study and others suggest that isolation poses a risk to CNS health. Isolation and HU led to discrete sets of differentially expressed cytokines in hippocampus, suggesting different immunoregulatory mechanisms invoked by each of these stressors. Collectively, the cytokines differentially expressed in response to HU or isolation as single factors are known to play roles in immune regulation, inflammatory disease and also are impacted by spaceflight. (Refer to ref.62for a recent review on the functions of interleukins and other cytokines). For example, circulating IL-20 protein levels (elevated by HU in our current study) are also increased at the early stages of rheumatoid arthritis and decreased after 6 months of treatment63,64. Further, IL-3 protein levels are greater in splenocytes and thymocytes from space-flown rats than ground controls65. In peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from astronauts onboard the ISS, IL-10 is reduced following lipopolysaccharide stimulation compared to controls7. Thus, our observations that simulated weightlessness and isolation provoke expression of discrete cytokine repertoires is consistent with our previous findings on immune cell responses using these models13. At the timepoint examined in this study, isolation had a more pronounced impact than HU on the expression of cytokines in the hippocampus, as indicated by differential expression of 11 cytokines as a result of isolation (single housed compared to social housed NL groups) versus 5 cytokines due to HU (social housed HU compared to NL groups). In addition, HU under single and social housed conditions resulted in distinct sets of differentially expressed cytokines in the hippocampus. Taken together, our findings support the hypothesis that simulated weightlessness and isolation activate discrete molecular and physiological mechanisms to regulate cytokine production. We found that cytokine responses to spaceflight stressors in the hippocampus versus circulation were also discrete under the experimental conditions used in this study. Further, isolation-induced cytokine responses were more extensive in the hippocampus compared to the plasma, based on the higher number of cytokines affected (11 and 3, respectively). Although only a single timepoint (30 days) was assessed in this study, our findings raise the possibility that changes in cytokine levels in the circulation may not mirror those in the brain during spaceflight. The 30 day HU period is considered a chronic exposure paradigm given that it accounts for 4% of an animal’s lifespan (assuming a 2 year lifespan). For perspective, a trip to Mars can take about two years, corresponding to 2.5% of a human lifespan (assuming 80 years as the average human lifespan). Our study is the first to implicate mitochondrial ROS in the CNS and in circulating cytokine levels brought about by combined isolation and simulated microgravity. MCAT mice exhibited protection from the hippocampal cytokine changes caused by isolation, simulated microgravity, and in combination. In plasma, HU-induced changes in cytokine expression were mitigated in MCAT mice. In the hippocampus of single housed MCAT mice, both IL-6 and TNFα show reduced expression relative to housing matched wild-type controls. Both of these cytokines are known to play a role in inflammation (chronic and acute) and in autoimmunity. In the same mice cohort we also found that HU elevated circulating neutrophils and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), suggesting increased inflammation while this effect was mitigated in MCAT mice66. Taken together, our findings are consistent with our hypothesis, highlighting the important role of ROS in modulating systemic and neuroimmune responses to simulated spaceflight. Our study contributes new information on the regulation of cytokine expression in the hippocampus in MCAT mice, a widely used genetic model for quenching mitochondrial ROS and studying diseases related to aging. MCAT mice have increased mean and maximum lifespan15, enhanced hippocampal spatial learning and memory, reduced contextual fear conditioning, delayed lung cancer onset67, and delayed age-related cardiac and ocular pathologies15. Some of the downregulated cytokines we observed in MCAT mice contribute to the cancer microenvironment (e.g., IL-6, INFγ, M-CSF, TNFα)67and other metabolic diseases. For example, MCP-1 and IL-6 contribute to the development of abnormal glucose and lipid metabolism68–70. Future studies could be conducted to test ROS-mediated modulation of the cytokine milieu as a potential mechanism for the resistance of MCAT mice to the abovementioned aging-related pathologies. In addition, our findings and those of others provide a rationale for future investigations on ROS quenching as a potential approach to mitigate inflammaging, the chronic low-grade inflammation associated with aging21. As we have reported previously, HU increased circulating corticosterone levels of WT mice after 30 days regardless of housing environment13. This effect was mitigated in MCAT single housed mice. In social housed NL animals, corticosterone levels were generally higher compared to the corresponding single housed group. The underlying basis for the higher corticosterone levels in these social housed mice versus single housed mice is unclear. Social hierarchy may exist between pair-housed female mice71, which may elevate the average corticosterone levels in paired housing versus single housing conditions. The social MCAT NL and HU groups had comparable corticosterone levels. HU in social housed MCAT mice did not lead to further increases in corticosterone levels possibly due to maximum upregulation of the HPA axis and/or a protective effect by the MCAT genotype. Interestingly, increased plasma corticosterone levels were observed in social housed mice even as plasma levels of an oxidative damage marker (4-HNE) and a subset of inflammatory cytokine protein levels in the hippocampus generally decreased. This suggests that elevated stress-associated hormones need not always coincide with pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidative states. This also raises the possibility that the increase in corticosterone levels in social housed groups is not a pathological response. The underlying mechanisms for the inverse relationship of corticosterone with both oxidative damage and inflammatory cytokines require further study. Female mice were selected for this study. Sex-specific differences in rodent responses to isolation can occur72,73. In humans, males and females show some differences in their responses to confinement74and bedrest, another microgravity analog75,76. Therefore, future investigations are needed to assess the sex-dependent effects of isolation and microgravity as well as any possible differences in oxidative stress responses. In summary, isolation and long-term simulated microgravity via HU altered cytokine expression levels in both the hippocampus and plasma. These effects in the brain were mitigated in MCAT mice, implicating an important role for mitochondrial ROS in aspects of the neuroimmune response to microgravity and isolation. Taken together, our findings and those of others provide a rationale for the use of antioxidant-based approaches to address anticipated CNS changes during spaceflight and in situations of isolation and reduced mobility on Earth. Female wild-type C57BL/6NJ and MCAT transgenic mice were included in this study. MCAT mice overexpress human catalase localized to the mitochondria15. Wild type (WT) and MCAT mice for use in the experiments were generated at NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) by crossing male MCAT mice, B6.Cg-Tg (CAG-OTC/CAT) 4033Prab/J with female C57BL/6NJ mice (from Jackson Laboratory; stocks 016197 and 005304, respectively). Genotyping was performed using the Red’N Amp PCR kit following the manufacturer’s protocol (Millipore-Sigma). All animal procedures were performed in compliance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at ARC. The approved animal protocols associated with this study are NAS-16-006 and NAS-16-007. Sample collection and analysis HU was initiated across three consecutive days with equal numbers of wild-type and MCAT mice (similar ages) on any given day to accommodate the large number of animals in this study. All experimental groups experienced the same length of treatments (e.g., HU). Consequently, dissections were performed across 3 consecutive days. The left brain hemisphere was flash frozen and a tissue biopsy (1.20 mm Harris micro punch) from the hippocampus was performed inside a cryotome chamber set at −20 °C to avoid thawing. Hippocampal tissue was then homogenized in mild lysis buffer (Tris 50 mM, NaCl 150 mM, Igepal 1%), Protease Inhibitors (Millipore-Sigma)78. Samples were then centrifuged at 4 °C at 1000 ×gfor 10 min and supernatants aliquoted and frozen at −80 °C until analysis. Cytokine protein abundance in hippocampal homogenates were analyzed using a Mouse Cytokine/Chemokine Array 44-Plex-MD44 (EVE Technologies), and concentration standards run for each cytokine. IL-3 cytokine expression was validated by ELISA (Abcam, Cat# ab113345-IL-3). Hippocampal cytokine levels were normalized to total protein content as determined by BCA assay. Blood was collected from the vena cava immediately after euthanasia. Undiluted plasma was analyzed for cytokine protein abundance as employed for hippocampal homogenates. Hippocampal homogenates were analyzed for ROS and related products. 4-Hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) adduct was measured by OxiSelect HNE Adduct Competitive ELISA (Cell Biolabs, Cat# STA-838). Assay for plasma corticosterone Plasma corticosterone was analyzed in 1:100 diluted plasma by ELISA (Abcam, Cat# ab108821).
