While new countermeasures have been implemented in a mission-specific manner, mitigating the metabolic changes of the skeleton in microgravity remains a challenge to the success of long-duration exploration class missions2,3. An increase in bone marrow adipose tissue (MAT) is commonly observed with a decline in bone mass. This association has been observed in humans in iliac crest biopsies and with non-invasive use of magnetic resonance imaging, and in animal models for aging, postmenopausal osteoporosis4and disuse5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16. Increased MAT was reported in humans following long-duration bedrest and in rodents during spaceflight13,17,18,19. Both osteoblasts and adipocytes differentiate from mesenchymal stem cells in the presence of specific transcription factors20,21,22,23. Since osteoblasts and adipocytes originate from the same progenitor pool within the bone marrow, it is possible that one cell type could be produced at the expense of the other20,24,25,26,27,28,29. However, a causal relationship has yet to be demonstrated. Thus, while conditions of disuse create a change in balance of cellular function within the bone marrow, it is not clear whether the concurrently observed infiltration of bone marrow fat actively contributes to bone loss. We have previously identifiedKitW/W−vmice as deficient in bone marrow adipose tissue (MAT-) in weight-bearing bones30,31. These mice have a loss of function mutation inc-kit,a receptor tyrosine kinase, located on selective hematopoietic lineage cells32,33. Since an inverse relationship between MAT accumulation and bone mass has been observed, we hypothesized that if MAT plays a causative role, MAT- mice would be resistant to disuse-induced bone loss. To test this hypothesis, we utilized hindlimb unloading (HU) as a ground-based model for spaceflight34. The HU model produces skeletal changes in hindlimbs of rodents similar to those observed in astronauts following spaceflight35. We therefore compared the skeletal response of adult male WT mice and MAT- mice to HU. Experiment 1 evaluated the impact of MAT deficiency on the skeletal response to HU. The effects of genotype (WT and MAT-), treatment (control and HU), and their interaction on body weight, abdominal white adipose tissue (WAT) weight, seminal vesicle weight and blood glucose at necropsy are shown inFig. 1. MAT- mice had a lower body weight than WT mice (Fig. 1a). No significant difference in body weight was observed in response to HU. MAT- mice had less abdominal WAT than WT mice (Fig. 1b). No significant difference in WAT weight was observed in response to HU. Seminal vesicle weight reflects testosterone levels in mice36. MAT- mice had lower seminal vesicle weight than WT mice (Fig. 1c) and HU resulted in greater seminal vesicle weight. Blood glucose was not different between genotypes (Fig. 1d). HU resulted in higher blood glucose concentrations, but MAT- HU mice experienced a greater increase in blood glucose. Effects of genotype, hindlimb unloading (HU) and their interaction on (a) body weight, (b) white adipose tissue weight, (c) seminal vesicle weight and (d) blood glucose. Two-way ANOVA: a, different from control mice within genotype. P-values significant at P ≤ 0.05. Mean ± SEM. The effects of genotype, HU and their interaction on cancellous bone microarchitecture in the distal femur metaphysis are shown inFig. 2. MAT- mice had a greater bone volume fraction than WT mice (Fig. 2a). HU resulted in a lower bone volume fraction in both genotypes, but the MAT- mice experienced a greater reduction in bone volume fraction. MAT- mice had a greater connectivity density (Fig. 2b) than WT mice. HU reduced the connectivity density of both genotypes, but MAT- mice experienced a greater reduction. MAT- mice had greater trabecular number than WT mice (Fig. 2c). HU resulted in lower trabecular number. MAT- mice had greater trabecular thickness than WT mice (Fig. 2d). HU resulted in lower trabecular thickness. MAT- mice had lower trabecular spacing than WT mice (Fig. 2e). HU resulted in greater trabecular spacing. Representative images of microarchitecture in the femur metaphysis are shown inFig. 2f–i. Shown are (a) cancellous bone volume fraction, (b) connectivity density, (c) trabecular number, (d) trabecular thickness, (e) trabecular spacing. Two-way ANOVA: a, different from control mice within genotype; b, different from WT mice within treatment. P-values significant at P ≤ 0.05. Mean ± SEM. Representative uCT images are show from (f) WT control, (g) WT HU, (h) MAT- control, and (i) MAT- HU mice. Images compiled by JAK. The effects of genotype, HU and their interaction on histomorphometry in the distal femur metaphysis are shown inFig. 3. As expected, adipocytes in bone marrow were not detected in MAT- mice (Fig. 3a–c). The absence of adipocytes can be visibly appreciated inFig. 3e. No significant differences were observed in bone marrow adiposity (Fig. 3a), adipocyte density (Fig. 3b) or adipocyte size (Fig. 3c) in response to HU in WT mice. Shown are (a) bone marrow adiposity, (b) adipocyte density, (c) adipocyte size, (d) image showing presence of adipocytes in WT mouse, (e) image showing absence of adipocytes in MAT- mouse, (f) osteoblast perimeter, (g) osteoclast perimeter, (h) mineralizing perimeter, (i) mineral apposition rate, and (j) bone formation rate. Two-way ANOVA: a, different from control mice within genotype; b, different from WT mice within treatment. P-values significant at P ≤ 0.05. Mean ± SEM. Image scale is 500 μm at 4x. Images taken by JAK. MAT- HU mice had greater osteoblast perimeter than WT HU mice (Fig. 3f). HU had no effect on osteoblast perimeter in WT mice, but resulted in greater osteoblast perimeter in the MAT- mice. MAT- mice had a greater osteoclast perimeter than WT mice (Fig. 3g). HU resulted in greater osteoclast perimeter. MAT- mice had greater mineralizing perimeter than WT mice (Fig. 3h). No significant difference in mineralizing perimeter was observed in response to HU. MAT- HU mice had greater mineral apposition rate than WT HU mice (Fig. 3i). HU had no effect on mineral apposition rate in WT mice, but resulted in greater mineral apposition rate in the MAT- mice. MAT- HU mice had greater bone formation rate than WT HU mice (Fig. 3j). HU had no effect on bone formation rate in the WT mice, but resulted in greater bone formation rate in MAT- mice. WT CTL mice were used to compare the effects of HU (red circle; 10 genes differentially expressed), MAT deficiency (green circle; 5 genes differentially expressed), and MAT deficiency after HU (blue circle; 21 genes differentially expressed). A pilot study showed that transplanting WT hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) intoKitW/W−vmice (WT→KitW/W−v) reconstituted the hematopoietic compartment without restoring MAT. Therefore, Experiment 2 was performed to determine if HU-induced bone loss occurs with MAT deficiency in WT→KitW/W−vmice. The absence of MAT following adoptive transfer of WT HSC was confirmed in the present study (Fig. 5). To determine the extent of hematopoietic cell compartment reconstitution with donor cells in irradiated recipients, adoptive transfer of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP)-positive HSC into irradiated recipients (GFP→KitW/W−v) was concurrently performed. The percentage of donor-derived GFP positive B cells and T cells, two immune cell populations derived from HSC, were determined in the peripheral blood lymphocytes of recipient mice 8 weeks post adoptive transfer (Fig. 6). As expected, the control mice had no GFP-positive cells. In the GFP→KitW/W−vmice, 95% of B cells and 79% of T cells were GFP positive.

The effect of HU on cancellous bone in the femur metaphysis of MAT- mice after adoptive transfer of WT HSC (WT→KitW/W−v) is shown inFig. 7. HU resulted in lower cancellous bone volume fraction (Fig. 7a), lower connectivity density (Fig. 7b), and lower trabecular thickness (Fig. 7d). No effect of HU was observed in trabecular number (Fig. 7c) or trabecular spacing (Fig. 7e). Shown are (a) cancellous bone volume fraction, (b) connectivity density, (c) trabecular number, (d) trabecular thickness and (e) trabecular spacing. T-test: P-values significant at P ≤ 0.05. Mean ± SEM. The MAT- mice exhibited compartment-specific alterations in skeletal microarchitecture. In the distal femur metaphysis, MAT- mice had higher cancellous bone volume fraction and better bone quality (higher connectivity density, higher trabecular thickness, higher trabecular number and lower trabecular spacing) compared to WT mice. A different pattern was observed in the femur epiphysis where no difference between genotypes was detected in cancellous bone volume fraction, but the MAT- mice had lower trabecular number and higher trabecular thickness. Compared to cancellous bone in the metaphysis, which is highly sensitive to systemic factors that regulate mineral homeostasis (e.g., gonadal hormones), cancellous bone in the epiphysis experiences higher strain energy levels during weight bearing, suggesting a more important mechanical role, and exhibits lower bone loss in response to gonadectomy or aging37,38,39. The potential for site-specific differences in regulation illustrate the importance of evaluating multiple skeletal sites. Two weeks of HU resulted in reduced cancellous bone volume fraction in the metaphysis in both WT and MAT- mice, but the reduction was greater in MAT- mice. HU also resulted in changes in bone microarchitecture consistent with deterioration in bone quality (decreased connectivity density, trabecular number, trabecular thickness, and increased trabecular spacing). HU resulted in higher osteoclast perimeter in WT mice without altering osteoblast perimeter, a result consistent with the effect of spaceflight on biochemical markers of bone turnover is astronauts44,45,46,47. HU resulted in higher bone formation in the metaphysis of MAT-mice, as well as higher osteoclast perimeter. Thus, while HU resulted in higher osteoblast perimeter, it was insufficient to balance the higher rate of bone resorption, resulting in less cancellous bone due to unbalanced bone turnover. Spaceflight is associated with the development of subclinical diabetogenic changes in astronauts52. Whole body insulin resistance was observed within one day in growing HU rats53. In the present study, HU resulted in higher blood glucose levels, a response that was accentuated in MAT- mice. This suggests that MAT- mice have an impaired ability to regulate blood glucose levels which may be relevant to their excessive bone loss compared to WT mice as the skeletal response to mechanical loading is impaired in mice with hyperglycemia54. Gene profiling adds further support to the conclusion that the underlying mechanisms mediating cancellous bone loss in the femur of HU MAT- and WT mice are not identical. There was little overlap in differentially expressed genes between HU WT and HU MAT- mice and where there was overlap (Comt, Esr1) the genes were differentially expressed in opposite directions. Particularly notable was the opposing differential response of estrogen receptor α (Esr1) in WT and MAT- mice to HU because estrogen receptor signaling plays an important role in the skeletal response to mechanical loading37. Also notable following HU was the genotype-specific (MAT- only) differential expression of genes related to fatty acid metabolism (Alox5, Alox10 and Alox12) and cytokine, neurotransmitter and hormone signaling (Comt, Hsd11b, Esr1, Igfbp2, Il6, Il6ra, Lta, Nos3, NPY, Nr3c1, Shbg, and Tshr). Further investigation is required to establish the significance of these differentially expressed genes in HU-induced bone loss. The animals were maintained in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the experimental protocol was approved by the Oregon State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The purpose of this experiment was to evaluate the skeletal response to HU in WT and MAT-deficientKitW/W−vmice. Four-week-old male WBB6F1/J-KitW/KitW−v/J (KitW/W−vor MAT-) mice and their WT WBB6F1/J littermates were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and single housed in a 32 °C room for the duration of the experiment. Housing mice at 32 °C (thermoneutral temperature) has been shown to minimize resting energy expenditure58,59, which should compensate for the inability of mice to huddle (regulating body temperature) during HU. Furthermore, adaptation to room temperature housing was recently shown to result in cancellous bone loss in mice38. At 16 weeks of age, the mice were randomized by body weight into one of six treatments (n= 10/group): WT baseline, WT control, WT HU, MAT- baseline, MAT- control, MAT- HU. Animals from the baseline groups were sacrificed. The next day, animals from the control and HU groups were transferred to unloading cages. The mice were unloaded for 2 weeks as described34. In brief, HU mice were placed in a restraint device, where the tail was cleaned with ethanol-soaked gauze and sprayed with a tincture of benzoin. A thin piece of traction tape was looped through a large paper clip, and then pressed along the sides of the mouse’s tail. Filament tape was wrapped around the tail in two locations to secure the traction tape: the base of the tail and 2.5 cm caudal. The paperclip end was looped through the clasp secured on the unloading apparatus. Mice were positioned in a 30° head-down tilt. All HU animals were provided with food and waterad libitum. The control groups were pair-fed to unloaded groups within genotype, and were given waterad libitum. Calcein injections (15 mg/kg; sc) were given 4 days and 1 day prior to termination to label mineralizing bone matrix. Mice were anesthetized then terminated using decapitation. The right femur from each mouse was placed in formalin for 24-hour fixation, then stored at 4 °C in 70% ethanol prior to sequential analysis by μCT and histomorphometry. The left femur was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, then stored at −80 °C for RNA analysis. Body weight (g), abdominal WAT weight (g), seminal vesicle weight (g; an index of androgen levels) and blood glucose (mg/dL) were recorded at necropsy. Mice were purchased and housed as in Experiment 1. WT littermates were used as donors of bone marrow. At 8 weeks of age, bone marrow transplant recipient mice were lethally irradiated (two split doses of 5 Gy each, 10 Gy total; Gammacell 22060Co gamma irradiator) then, the following day, injected with purified HSC from donor WT mice. The purified HSC were prepared as follows: whole bone marrow cells were harvested from the femora and tibia of 12 donor mice. Lineage negative (lin−) cells were enriched from bone marrow cells using magnetic cell separation with MACS lineage cell depletion kit (Miltenyi Biotec Inc., Auburn, CA, USA). Enriched lin-bone marrow cells were incubated with anti-CD117 (c-kit) and anti-Sca-1 antibodies (eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA). HSC (Lin−Sca-1+c-Kit+) were purified from enriched lin-by flow cytometry and single cell sorting60,61using MoFlo XDP (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Purified HSC were resuspended in saline, and 200 μl containing 1,000 donor HSC were injected into the tail vein of each irradiated recipient mouse. Tracking of cellular repopulation was performed with the use of HSC from GFP-expressing mice (GFP→KitW/W−v;n= 3) using the same protocol. The percentages of GFP-positive B and T cells in peripheral blood lymphocytes were measured by flow cytometry using B cell-specific (CD19) and T cell-specific (CD3) antibodies 8 weeks post adoptive transfer. Mice that did not undergo adoptive transfer were used as controls (n= 2). At 16-weeks of age the mice were randomized by body weight into one of two treatments (n= 10/group): 1) WT→KitW/W−vcontrol, 2) WT→KitW/W−vHU. Control and HU animals were then transferred to the unloading cages. Unloading and tissue collection were performed as described in Experiment 1. μCT was used for nondestructive three-dimensional evaluation of cancellous bone volume and architecture. Femora were scanned using a Scanco μCT40 scanner (Scanco Medical AG, Basserdorf, Switzerland) at a voxel size of 12 μm × 12 μm × 12 μm (55 kVpx-ray voltage, 145 μA intensity, and 200 ms integration time). Filtering parameters sigma and support were set to 0.8 and 1, respectively. The threshold value for evaluation was determined empirically and set at 245 (gray scale, 0–1000). Cancellous bone was evaluated in the distal femur metaphysis and epiphysis. Assessment of cancellous bone in the distal femur metaphysis began 45 slices (540 μm in length) proximal to the growth plate, and included forty slices (480 μm in length) of cancellous bone. The entire cancellous bone compartment was evaluated in the distal femur epiphysis. Direct cancellous bone measurements included bone volume fraction (bone volume/tissue volume; volume of total tissue occupied by cancellous bone, %), connectivity density (number of redundant connections per unit volume, mm−3), trabecular thickness (mean thickness of individual trabeculae, μm), trabecular number (number of trabecular intercepts per unit length, mm−1) and trabecular spacing (distance between trabeculae, μm). Static (cell-based) histological measurements include bone marrow adiposity (adipocyte area/tissue area; %), adipocyte density (#/mm2), adipocyte size (μm2), osteoblast perimeter (osteoblast perimeter/bone perimeter; %) and osteoclast perimeter (osteoclast perimeter/bone perimeter; %). Adipocytes were identified as large circular or oval-shaped cells bordered by a prominent cell membrane lacking cytoplasmic staining due to alcohol extraction of intracellular lipids during processing63. Osteoblast perimeter was determined as a percentage of total bone perimeter lined by plump cuboidal cells located immediately adjacent to the thin layer of osteoid in direct physical contact with bone. Osteoclast perimeter was determined as a percentage of cancellous bone perimeter covered by multinucleated cells with an acid phosphatase-positive cytoplasm (stained red). Dynamic (fluorochrome) histological measurements include mineralizing perimeter (mineralizing perimeter/bone perimeter; %), mineral apposition rate (distance between two fluorochrome markers that comprise a double label divided by the 3 day label interval; μm/day), and bone formation rate (mineralizing perimeter multiplied by mineral apposition rate normalized to bone perimeter; μm2/μm/year). Femora (n = 5/group) were pulverized with a mortar and pestle in liquid nitrogen, then further homogenized in TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Total RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer’s protocol, and mRNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix for qRT-PCR (Invitrogen). The expression of 84 genes related to osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation and function was determined using the Mouse “Osteoporosis” RT2Profiler PCR Array (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Gene expression was normalized toGapdhand relative quantification was determined by the ΔΔCt method using RT2Profiler PCR Array Data Analysis software version 3.5 (Qiagen). Two of the twenty samples did not meet quality control standards for interpretation of array data and were excluded. Means in Experiment 1 were compared between genotype and treatment groups using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). When significant interactions were present, t-tests were used to make two-group comparisons with “a” used to signify a difference from control mice within genotype and “b” used to signify a difference from WT mice within treatment. When non-significant interactions were present, group comparisons were made from two-way ANOVA with main effects for genotype and treatment. Means for bone marrow adiposity, adipocyte density and adipocyte size were compared using t-tests, since the absence of marrow adiposity inKitW/W−vmice made the use of two-way ANOVA invalid. Means among baseline, control and HU groups within genotype were compared using one-way ANOVA. When the ANOVA was significant, Dunnett’s test was used to make comparisons to the baseline group. Means in Experiment 2 were compared using t-tests Publisher's note:Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.
