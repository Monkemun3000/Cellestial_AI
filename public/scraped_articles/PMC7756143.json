Subject Areas:Transcriptomics, Space Sciences Experimentation is necessary to understand how organisms respond to space Specialized protocols are used for preserving biological samples on the ISS RNAseq datasets are impacted by preservation protocols used on the ISS Impacts can be alleviated with improved carcass preservation protocols Transcriptomics; Space Sciences Spaceflight places multiple stresses upon the human body including altered gravity fields and exposure to cosmic radiation, which lead to health risks for spacefaring humans (Institute of Medicine, 2008). Decades of research on astronauts has begun to reveal how humans respond to the spaceflight environment (Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019) but physiological monitoring of astronauts is still limited. Thus, rodent models have been essential for advancing our understanding of how mammals—including humans—respond to spaceflight. This includes the impact of spaceflight on muscle structure (Shen et al., 2017;Spatz et al., 2017;Tascher et al., 2017), liver (Beheshti et al., 2019;Jonscher et al., 2016), and immune functions (Pecaut et al., 2017;Rettig et al., 2017;Ward et al., 2018). Despite success of the rodent model, sample collection under such difficult conditions introduces confounding factors that need to be identified and addressed. These are related to hardware limitations, small sample size, and severe restraints on astronaut crew availability. Successful experiments must work within these constraints to produce meaningful insights. In response, the first Rodent Research (RR) mission established new capabilities for conducting reliable long-duration experiments using rodents with on-orbit sample collection. Animals can either be euthanized onboard the ISS or returned to Earth alive. Both approaches introduce confounding factors. The former is experimentally challenging but preserves the sample during exposure to microgravity, whereas the latter exposes the animal to re-entry stresses, and sampling occurs only after a variable lag between landing and euthanasia—essentially sampling re-adaptation to Earth conditions in addition to the response to spaceflight. Inconsistent handling of samples necessitates a clear understanding of how dissection and preservation protocols affect downstream data generation. We previously showed, using transcriptomic, proteomic, and immunohistochemical data from the Rodent Research-1 (RR-1), Rodent Research-3 (RR-3), and Space Transportation System (STS)-135 missions, that lipotoxic pathways are activated in rodent liver in two different strains of mice that were flown for as long as 42 days in space (Beheshti et al., 2019). Because animals in the RR-1 and RR-3 experiments were euthanized in space, this work suggested that space alone was the most likely cause for similar changes previously observed in liver samples from mice flown during the STS-135 experiments where animals returned alive to Earth (Jonscher et al., 2016). The lipotoxic effect is stronger with duration and may have ramifications for astronauts' health during long missions. This analysis did not include two flight and two ground animals from RR-1, as these animals were dissected immediately after euthanasia on-orbit as opposed to the rest, which were first returned to Earth as intact frozen carcasses for later dissection. GLDS (GeneLab Data Systems) Datasets Used in This Study Immediate = tissues that were dissected immediately after euthanasia and Carcass = tissues that were dissected from frozen carcasses after partial thawing. Preservation Method Is the Primary Driver of Gene Expression Variance in RR-1 Liver Samples Gene Expression Differences in RR-1 NASA Spaceflight and Ground Control Liver Samples Prepared via polyA Selection (A) Principal component analysis of global gene expression in RR-1 NASA spaceflight (FLT) and respective ground control (GC) liver samples dissected immediately after euthanasia (I) or from frozen carcasses (C). Percent variance for each principal component (PC) is shown.

(B) Enriched GO terms between the spaceflight (FLT) and ground control (GC) carcass samples identified by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (gene set permutation). In both A and B, the more positive or negative the enrichment scores, the higher the expression in spaceflight or ground control samples, respectively. Dot size indicates number of genes within each GO term. Dot color indicates false discovery rate (FDR). GO terms displayed met the thresholds of FDR <0.05, NOM p < 0.01, gene set size >40. (C) Venn diagram of the number of enriched GO terms identified in Carcass (blue) and Immediate (red) samples when comparing spaceflight (FLT) and ground control (GC) samples. GO terms in Venn diagram met the threshold of FDR <0.05, NOM p < 0.01. Data are from GLDS-48. Since livers from only 2 FLT and 2 GC animals in the RR-1 NASA Validation mission were preserved via the immediate method, RNA from livers prepared via the immediate method from two additional studies, the RR-1 CASIS mission (Figure S1) (Cadena et al., 2019;Globus et al., 2015;Ronca et al., 2019) and a ground-based preservation and storage study (Figure S2) (Choi et al., 2016;GeneLab, 2016), were also sequenced following polyA selection. Despite multiple different experimental factors in RR-1 NASA, RR-1 CASIS, and the ground-based preservation studies, PCA continued to show preservation method as the primary driver of variance among samples in these datasets (Figure S3). Carcass-Preserved Samples Exhibit Less Uniform Transcript Coverage than Immediate-Preserved Samples To further investigate the observed differences in preservation method, RR-1 NASA FLT and GC liver samples derived from the carcass preservation method were grouped together (C) and FLT and GC liver samples derived from the immediate preservation method were grouped together (I). DGE was evaluated in carcass versus immediate samples. Many more genes were differentially expressed in carcass versus immediate samples (2,934 DEGs) than in either FLT-C versus GC-C (619 DEGs) or in FLT-I versus GC-I (67 DEGs) samples, further supporting preservation method as the primary driver of variance in RR-1 NASA liver samples (Figure 3A). Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that several of the gene ontologies enriched in carcass samples (when compared with immediate samples) involved RNA regulation and processing (Figure 3B). Despite similarly high RNA Integrity Number (RIN) values (Figure S4), carcass samples exhibited significantly less 5′ to 3′ gene body coverage than immediate samples as indicated by their 5′ to 3′ transcript integrity ratios. The 5′ to 3′ transcript integrity ratios were determined by dividing the percent coverage indicated in the 5′-shaded region by that in the 3′-shaded region for each sample (Figures 3C and D).

All Carcass (blue) and Immediate (red) samples are grouped together (∗∗ = p < 0.01, Mann–Whitney U test). (E) Average expression of polyA removal genes in Carcass (blue) and Immediate (red) groups from RNAseq data. Cnot1, Cnot2, Cnot3, Cnot4, Cnot9, Cnot10, Cnot6, Cnot6l, Cnot7, and Cnot8 are part of the CCR4-NOT complex. Pan2 and Pan3 are part of the PAN2-PAN3 complex. Error bars indicate standard deviation (∗ = adj. p < 0.05, ∗∗ = adj. p < 0.01, ∗∗∗ = adj. p < 0.001, ns = not significant, Wald test). Data are from GLDS-48. Expression of Genes Involved in 5′-Methylguanosine Decapping and PolyA Removal Is Affected by Preservation Condition Given the differences in gene body coverage between carcass and immediate samples, we evaluated the expression of 5′-methylguanosine decapping and polyA removal genes in these groups from the RNAseq data. In mammals, eight genes have decapping activityin vitroand/or in cells: Dcp2 (Nudt20), Nudt3, Nudt16, Nudt2, Nudt12, Nudt15, Nudt17, Nudt19. In addition, Dxo acts on partially capped mRNAs (Grudzien-Nogalska and Kiledjian, 2017). Two of these genes—Dxo and Nudt2—were significantly more expressed in the carcass samples, whereas another two—Nudt15 and Dcp2 (Nudt20)—were significantly more expressed in immediate samples (Figure S5). Removal of polyA tails from mRNA is catalyzed by two complexes. The first, CCR4-NOT, consists of CNOT1, CNOT2, CNOT3, CNOT4, CNOT9, CNOT10, CNOT6, CNOT6L, CNOT7, and CNOT8. The second, PAN2-PAN3, consists of PAN2 and PAN3 (Siwaszek et al., 2014). In the case of the 10 subunit CCR4-NOT complex, we observed 5 genes that were more highly expressed in the immediate group (Cnot1, Cnot2, Cnot9, Cnot6, Cnot6L) and 3 that were more highly expressed in the carcass group (Cnot3, Cnot10, Cnot7) (Figure 3E). In the case of the PAN2-PAN3 complex, both Pan2 and Pan3 were more highly expressed in the carcass group (Figure 3E). Samples Sequenced Following Ribodepletion Exhibit More Uniform Transcript Coverage than Samples Prepared with PolyA Selection The polyA selection library preparation method, which was initially used to evaluate gene expression differences in RR-1 NASA Validation mission liver samples, requires intact RNA to minimize bias (Kumar et al., 2017;Petrova et al., 2017). Because our data suggest that the carcass samples were more degraded than the immediate samples (Figures 3C and 3D), the total RNA isolated from the RR-1 NASA Validation mission carcass liver samples was used to prepare libraries with the ribodepletion method to minimize transcript integrity bias, then re-sequenced. PCA showed a more distinct separation of FLT and GC carcass samples when the samples were prepared via the ribodepletion method (Figure 4A) than by polyA selection (FLT-C and GC-C samples inFigure 1A). DEGs were identified in FLT versus GC carcass samples prepared with the ribodepletion method and compared with those from polyA-prepared carcass samples. Although hundreds of DEGs in FLT versus GC carcass samples overlap between ribodepleted and polyA-prepared samples, more DEGs were identified in FLT versus GC samples prepared with the ribodepletion method (Figure 4B), suggesting this method may be more sensitive. There was no overlap of enriched gene ontology terms in FLT versus GC samples processed by ribodepletion and polyA enrichment (Figures 4C and 4D). (A) Principal component analysis of global gene expression in RR-1 NASA spaceflight (FLT) and ground control (GC) liver samples dissected from frozen carcasses (C) and prepared via ribodepletion (Ribo(−)). Percent variance for each principal component (PC) are shown. (C) Venn diagram of the number of similar and unique enriched gene ontology (GO) terms (spaceflight (FLT) versus ground control (GC)) identified in ribodepleted (black) and polyA selected (red) prepared samples (NOM p < 0.01, FDR <0.5, phenotype permutation). (D) Enriched GO terms between the spaceflight (FLT) and ground control (GC) carcass samples prepared with ribodepletion identified by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (phenotype permutation). The more positive or negative the enrichment scores, the higher the expression in spaceflight or ground control samples, respectively. Dot size indicates number of genes within GO term. Dot color indicates false discovery rate (FDR). GO terms displayed met the thresholds of FDR <0.5, NOM p < 0.01, 1.6 < NES < −1.6. (E) Gene body coverage of ribodepleted (Ribo(−)) and polyA selected (polyA) spaceflight and ground control carcass (C) samples. (F) The percent coverage of the 5′- and 3′-shaded regions in panel E were used to calculate the transcript integrity ratio for each sample (∗∗∗ = p < 0.001, Mann–Whitney U test). Data are from GLDS-48 and -168. Next, transcript integrity was evaluated in the ribodepletion-prepared FLT and GC carcass samples and compared with polyA-selection-prepared carcass samples. Samples prepared with the polyA selection method exhibited less coverage of the 5′ portion of transcripts compared with ribodepletion-prepared samples (Figures 4E and 4F). Thus, ribodepletion was used to further investigate the effects of preservation method (Carcass versus Immediate) on gene-expression in a ground-based tissue preservation study. Total RNA Sequencing Mitigates the Impact of Preservation Method on Gene Expression Changes in the Liver Mice of the same age, sex, strain, and source as those used in the RR-1 NASA Validation mission were used in the ground-based tissue preservation study. Mice were evenly divided into one of six groups as shown inFigure S6. The mice in groups 1–4 were euthanized with pentobarbital/phenytoin (Euthasol) as in RR-1 (Choi et al., 2020), then subjected to various preservation protocols to evaluate the phenomena observed in RR-1 NASA carcass and immediate liver samples. Livers and quadriceps were dissected immediately after euthanasia from mice in group 1. These tissues were divided into thirds and preserved in one of three ways: (1) freezing in dry ice to mimic the cold stowage container that was used to freeze the immediate liver samples in the RR-1 mission, (2) submersion in LN2, or (3) with RNAlater. After preservation, all tissues were stored at −80°C until further processing. Carcasses from mice in groups 2–4 were partially thawed, and quadriceps and livers were dissected, then snap frozen, and stored at −80°C until RNA extraction to mimic the protocol most commonly implemented when carcasses return from spaceflight missions, including RR-1. A summary of all liver and quadriceps tissues evaluated in the present ground-based tissue preservation study are summarized inTables S1andS2, respectively. Total RNA was extracted from all liver and quadriceps tissue samples and prepared for sequencing using the ribodepletion method and sequenced. Liver and quadriceps samples were dissected from mice immediately after euthanasia with pentobarbital/phenytoin (Euthasol) then preserved in dry ice (I_DI), liquid nitrogen (I_LN2), or RNAlater(I_RNAlat) before RNAseq analysis. Alternatively, liver and quadriceps samples were dissected from partially thawed frozen carcasses of mice that were euthanized with pentobarbital/phenytoin (Euthasol) and then preserved in dry ice (C_DI), liquid nitrogen (C_LN2), or segmented into thirds and preserved in RNAlater(C_RNAlat) before RNAseq analysis.

(C) Principal component analysis of quadriceps samples. Percent variance for each principal component (PC) is shown. (D) Uniformity of gene body coverage in quadriceps samples. (∗∗∗ = p < 0.001, ∗∗ = p < 0.01, ∗ = p < 0.05, ns = no significance, Mann–Whitney U test). Data are from GLDS-235 (liver) and -236 (quadriceps). Carcass Preservation by LN2 or RNAlater Immersion Most Closely Mimic Standard Tissue Preservation Protocols Livers dissected from carcasses preserved in either RNAlateror LN2 exhibit more overlap with immediate preserved liver samples than those from carcasses preserved in dry ice (Figure 5A). Unlike livers dissected from slow (dry ice) or snap (LN2) frozen carcasses, livers dissected from carcasses preserved in RNAlatershowed no difference in 5′ to 3′ transcript coverage when compared with livers dissected immediately after euthanasia (Figure 5B). These data suggest that carcass segmentation and preservation in RNAlatermay protect the liver from transcript degradation when preservedin situ. The Impact of Preservation Method on Gene Expression Is Tissue Dependent Gene Expression in Select Tissues Was Not Affected by the Method of Euthanasia Herein, we show that protocols used to preserve mouse carcasses on-orbit have large effects on gene expression patterns as measured by RNAseq. Indeed, changes in gene expression due to preservation condition overwhelmed those due to spaceflight. Gene set enrichment analysis showed that many GO terms enriched due to carcass preservation were involved in RNA processing. This correlated with reduced transcript integrity (relatively poor coverage of the 5′ end of transcripts) in samples from carcasses preserved on-orbit when these were sequenced with a polyA enrichment RNAseq protocol. mRNA degradation starts with the removal of the polyA tail, at which point degradation continues either from the 3′ endviathe exosome complex or the 5′ end following removal of the 5′-methylguanosine cap. Deadenylation of cytoplasmic mRNA is the rate-limiting step in mRNA degradation and is catalyzed by one of two complexes: the CCR4-NOT complex, which consists of 10 subunits (CNOT1, CNOT2, CNOT3, CNOT4, CNOT6, CNOT6l, CNOT7, CNOT8, CNOT9, CNOT10), and the PAN2-PAN3 deadenylation complex consisting of two subunits (PAN2, PAN3) (Siwaszek et al., 2014). We observed transcriptional changes to multiple subunits in each of these complexes when comparing carcass and immediate samples. Most striking was the coordinated upregulation of both Pan2 and Pan3 in the carcass samples from the RR-1 NASA Validation mission, which suggests an increase in PAN2-PAN3 deadenylation activity, which could result in loss of polyA tails in some transcripts. This could lead to poor mRNA capture by our polyA enrichment protocol and result in some of the differences seen between the polyA enrichment and ribodepletion protocols. Three proteins—Dcp2 (Nudt20), Nudt3, Nudt16—have decapping activity bothin vitroand in cells, whereas an additional five—Nudt2, Nudt12, Nudt15, Nudt17, Nudt19—have decapping activityin vitro. In addition, the Dxo family of proteins acts on partially capped mRNAs (Grudzien-Nogalska and Kiledjian, 2017). Although regulation of these proteins is complex and involves subcellular localization and post-translation modification, we observed evidence for altered expression of these decapping enzymes: Dxo and Nudt2 were more abundant in carcass samples, whereas Nudt15 and Dcp2 (Nudt20) were more abundant in immediate samples. Although these changes are not coordinated, they do point to altered decapping activity within the carcass samples. As decapping precedes mRNA degradation via the 5′ exonuclease, XRN1, this could alternatively explain the relatively poor 5′ transcript coverage seen in both polyA enriched and ribodepleted carcass liver samples. Additional experimentation will be necessary to confirm the changes to decapping and deadenylation enzymes seen here and to understand their role in the 5′ to 3′ coverage bias observed. Sample Preservation and Preparation Recommendations This study directly assessed the effects of preservation protocols on mouse liver and quadriceps, thus extrapolation to other tissues should be done with caution. Moreover, this study is not capable of identifying the molecular mechanisms responsible for the observed effects, and additional experimentation is required to confirm that the changes to decapping enzyme expression are responsible for changes in transcript integrity and apparent gene expression.
