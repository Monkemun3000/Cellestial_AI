Immune-suppressive virus-like particles (VLPs) (e.g., VcVLPs in the ichneumonidVenturia canescensand FaENVs in the braconidFopius arisanus) lack proviral DNA segments, but are of viral origin and transfer virulence proteins into host cells (Pichonet al.2015;Burkeet al.2018). Viral genes encoding VLP proteins are either dispersed in the wasp genome (as in VcVLP) or present in discrete genomic areas (as in FaENV). Thus, various independent viral endogenization events have been important for successful parasitism by these wasps (Strand and Burke 2015;Gauthieret al.2018). Here, we focus on immune-suppressive particles of figitid wasps in the genusLeptopilina, that infectDrosophilaspp. and are gaining importance as models for natural host-parasite interactions (Keebaugh and Schlenke 2014).Leptopilina heterotoma(Lh),L. victoriae(Lv), andL. boulardi(Lb) produce VLPs in their venom glands. The VLPs ofLeptopilinaspp. and their proteins have been linked to parasite success (Rizkiet al.1990;Dupaset al.1996;Moraleset al.2005;Labrosseet al.2005;Chiuet al.2006;Heavneret al.2014). Evidence for DNA inLeptopilinaVLPs is lacking, and because of the absence of a published wasp genome, the chromosomalvs.extrachromosomal location of MSEV protein genes is not known. Our goals here are (a) to describe additional proteins in the MSEV proteome and examine their relationship with PDV and other viral proteins, and (b) determine whether MSEV genes are encoded in the wasp genome. IsogenizedLhstrains New York (NY; (Chiu and Govind 2002;Chiuet al.2006)) andLh14 (Schlenkeet al.2007), were raised on they wstrain ofD. melanogasterthat were reared on standard cornmeal, yeast, and agar fly food at 25° as described bySmallet al. (2012). Adult wasps were collected from parasitized hosts, 25 days after infection at 25°. Male and female wasps were stored on fly food with 70% honey on “buzz” plugs. Analysis of MSEV super-set ORFs The GhostKOALA algorithm (Kanehisaet al.2016) was used to assign KEGG ortholog (KO) numbers for the MSEV superset protein sequences. If a primary KO number failed to be assigned by GhostKOALA, a secondary number assignment with a score >= 50 was used. Redundant KO numbers were excluded. MSEV proteins were included in the enrichment analyses only if a human ortholog exists; the gene identifiers for human orthologs were obtained from the MSEV KO and the UniProt mapping utility (Liet al.2015;Uniport Consortium 2015). (Human orthologs were chosen because a robust proportion of Vesiclepedia’s data are derived from human vesicle proteomes.) The orthologs of human genes were analyzed for enrichment with the FunRich algorithm (Pathanet al.2015;Pathanet al.2017) against the Vesiclepedia database (Kalraet al.2012;Pathanet al.2019). Finally, the MSEV proteome was used as a query using BLASTp for the following databases: “non-redundant” (nr), nr restricted to Taxid: Viridae (10239), nr restricted to Taxid: Polydnaviridae (10482), and nr restricted to Taxid: Unclassified Polydnaviridae (40273) (E-value threshold: 1.0x10−3, %ID minimum: 20%, performed 04/16/2019). tBLASTn ofL. boulardiandG. hookeri(previously calledGanaspis spp. 1) (Goeckset al.2013) transcriptomes was performed on 03/10/2019; the threshold for homologs inLbandG. hookeriwere 25% ID and an E-value of 1.0x10−10. Genomes sequencing and assembly Library preparations, sequencing reactions, and associated validations were conducted by GENEWIZ, Inc. (South Plainfield, NJ, USA). Genomic DNA was extracted from ∼50 mg of tissue (∼100 wasps) ofLhmales and females separately using mixed bead beating and PureLink Genomic DNA extraction kits following manufacturer’s protocol. Quantification of extracted DNA was performed using Nanodrop and Qubit2.0 Fluorometer (Live Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Integrity of genomic DNA was verified by gel electrophoresis (0.6% agarose). DNA libraries were prepared for each wasp gender by acoustic shearing fragmentation using a Covaris S220. Fragments were end repaired and adenylated prior to adapter ligation on 3′ ends (NEB NextUltra DNA Library Preparation kit, Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Enrichment and indexing of adapter-ligated DNA was done through limited cycle PCR. DNA library validation was performed using TapeStation (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA). Libraries were quantified using Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer. Real time PCR (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used to quantify DNA molar mass for each library before multiplexing in equal molar mass. DNA libraries were sequenced using a 2x150 paired-end (PE) configuration on one lane on an Illumina HiSeq 4000. Image analysis and base calling were performed using the HiSeq Control Software (HCS) on the HiSeq instrument. The average size of inserts (without adaptors) in the Illumina library was ∼300-350 bp.De novoassembly of reads and scaffolding of contigs was performed using ABySS 2.2 (Jackmanet al.2017) by the New York Genome Center.De novoassembly of combined male/female genome was performed using Platanus-allee (Kajitaniet al.2019) and scaffolding was improved using AGOUTI (Zhanget al.2016) on the University of Delaware’s BIOMIX cluster. Sequences fromDrosophila-associated bacteria such asWolbachiaspp.,Acetobacter pasteurianus, andLactobacillus plantarumwere identified in both assemblies.Wolbachiaare endosymbionts of many insects includingLeptopilinaspp. (Pannebakkeret al.2004;Werrenet al.2008;Gueguenet al.2012).LactobacilliandAcetobacterare symbionts and commensals of sugar-consuming insects (Crottiet al.2010;Engel and Moran 2013). Among the three bacterial species,Wolbachiasequences were the most abundant. BLASTx analysis showed that predicted genes fromWolbachiascaffolds were associated withWolbachiaproteins in GenBank. These bacterial and mitochondrial sequence-containing scaffolds were identified during the NCBI submission process and were manually removed from the submission. Evaluation of genome assemblies Assemblies made with ABySS and Platanus-allee with AGOUTI were run through QUAST v4.0 (Mikheenkoet al.2016) to determine scaffold number, N50, and GC%. All assemblies were examined for conserved genes and orthologs with BUSCO v9 (Simãoet al.2015;Waterhouseet al.2017) using the Insecta set and training parameters set to “Nasonia”. NCBI BLAST+ (v 2.7.1) was used to compare selected scaffolds produced from male and female genome assemblies (Johnsonet al.2008;Camachoet al.2009). E-value threshold was set at 1x10−7. E-values of alignments were considered acceptable if within the range of 0 to 1x10−10. K-mer analysis was performed using the K-mer Analysis Toolkit (KAT) (Maplesonet al.2016) and heat maps were used to compare multiplicity (coverage plus repeats) of K-mers to GC content of the reads, coloring bins according to the number of distinct K-mers in each. This analysis was used to determine whether there were separate clusters of multiplicity/GC content that might arise from different sources, such as contamination. BLAST (Altschulet al.1990;Camachoet al.2009;Johnsonet al.2008) was used to search for homologs of a random sample of genomic scaffolds to which reads from each cluster mapped. The joint assembly of theLh 14genome was compared to the publishedL. clavipesgenome (Bioproject: PRJNA84205 (Kraaijeveldet al.2016)) through maps of 27-mer multiplicityvs.GC content. Finally, 27-mer multiplicity/GC content of the scaffolds (9.6 Mb) containing MSEV genes was compared to a random subset of scaffolds (9.6 Mb) without MSEV genes. Statistical differences betweenLh 14andL. clavipesgenomes and between MSEV-gene containing scaffolds and non-MSEV-gene containing scaffolds were calculated using a multivariate Cramér test (Ihaka and Gentleman 1996;Baringhaus and Franz 2004;Franz 2019). Gene predictions, gene annotation, and viral gene searches Gene predictions were performed on parallel and anti-parallel strands using AUGUSTUS (v3.3.1; August 2018) (Stankeet al.2004;Stanke and Morgenstern 2005;Kelleret al.2011) with theNasoniatraining set. The AUGUSTUS readout was separated into mRNA, coding DNA sequence (CDS), and translations by gffread (Trapnellet al.2012). NCBI BLAST+ (v 2.7.1) was used on a local machine to search predictions and scaffolds, cutoff was %ID >70%, E-value < 1E-50, and query coverage > 70%. MSEV genes and 1x10−2for Polydnavirus and Nudivirus proteins. FamilyPolydnaviridaeandNudiviridaeprotein sequences for the 11 species available on OrthoDB v9 were downloaded on February 2019 (Johnsonet al.2008;Camachoet al.2009). Whole-body transcriptome sequencing and assembly Total RNA extraction, library preparations, sequencing reactions, and bioinformatics analysis were conducted at GENEWIZ, INC (South Plainfield, NJ, USA). RNA was extracted from frozen tissue with the Qiagen RNeasy Plus Universal mini kit using manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The extracted RNA was quantified using a Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer and its integrity was checked with the 4200 TapeStation (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA). RNA samples were enriched for mRNA using Oligo d(T) beads. RNA sequencing libraries were prepared using the NEBNext Ultra RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina following manufacturer’s instructions (NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA). The sequencing libraries were validated by using the Agilent TapeStation. Quantification was performed using the Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer and quantitative PCR (KAPA Biosystems, Wilimington, MA, USA). Sequencing libraries were clustered on a single lane of a flow cell and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 instrument using a 2x150 PE configuration. Image analysis and base calling were conducted by the HCS. Raw sequence data (.bcl files) was converted into fastq files and de-multiplexed using Illumina’s bcl2fastq 2.17 software. One mismatch was allowed for index sequence identification. The Trinity v2.5 (Grabherret al.2011),de novoassembler was used to assemble theLh 14transcripts. Thede novoassembled transcriptome was created with a minimum contig length of 200 bp per sample. Transrate v1.0.3 (Smith-Unnaet al.2016) was used to generate statistics for thede novoassembled transcriptome. EMBOSS tools getorf were then used to find the ORFs within thede novoassembled transcriptome. Thede novotranscriptome assembly was then annotated using Diamond BLASTx (Buchfinket al.2015). The transcriptome reads were mapped to the genomic scaffolds for downstream analyses using HISAT2 or BWA (Li and Durbin 2009;Kimet al.2015). Preparation of template DNA and PCR Male and female wasps (n = 12, for each sex), were separated and washed in 70% ethanol, and then rinsed twice in deionized water. Genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted using a Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit following provided protocols. gDNA was eluted in Tris-EDTA buffer, pH 8.0, and stored at 4°. The concentration of gDNA was determined by NanoDrop (Thermo Fisher). For cDNA preparation, male and female wasps (n = 12 for each sex), were separated and washed in 70% ethanol and rinsed twice in deionized water. Total body RNA was extracted using 100 µL of Trizol (Invitrogen) following manufacturer’s protocols. RNA was resuspended in 0.1% DEPC treated water and treated with DNase I to remove contaminating DNA (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The RNA concentration was determined by NanoDrop (Thermo Fisher). cDNA was synthesized using Proto-Script First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (New England Biolabs). Primers forp40 and SmGTPase01are as follows: p40forward: GAATCATTGTTCGTTTGCTTGAAGAAAGAATTGG p40reverse: CATTATTAATGGGCCTTTACAATAATTTTAGCC SmGTPase01forward: CGTTGCACTACCTTGTTTGTCA SmGTPase01reverse: TTGTCTTTGCCCTGAGCGTT PCRs were performed with Taq polymerase (gift of C. Li lab, CCNY), PCR buffer (300 mM Tris HCl pH 9.5, 75 mM (NH4)2SO4, 10 mM MgCl2) and deoxyribonucleotides (0.2 mM; Thermo Fisher Scientific). The PCR products were resolved on a 1% agarose gel in Tris acetic acid EDTA buffer (40 mM Tris HCl pH 7.6, 20 mM acetic acid, 1mM EDTA pH 8.0). Ethidium bromide (Sigma Aldrich)-stained gels were visualized on an ultra violet Trans-Illuminator (UVP) and gel images were taken using the DigiDocIt Imaging System (UVP). Gel images were processed in Adobe Photoshop for clarity only. gDNA or cDNA-containing PCR products were cloned into pCR TOPO II plasmids (Invitrogen) and transformed into DH10β competent cells (New England Biolabs). For plasmid preparation, colonies were screened via PCR and positive colonies were cultured in Luria Broth with ampicillin (100 µg/mL) at 37° overnight. Plasmids were extracted using Plasmid Miniprep kit (Qiagen) and sequenced (GENEWIZ, INC. South Plainfield, NJ, USA). Sequences were aligned using NCBI BLAST+ (Johnsonet al.2008;Camachoet al.2009) and Clustal Omega (Liet al.2015). Expected PCR band sizes were determined using SerialCloner (v2.6.1). The superset of MSEV proteins: (A)Lh14 MSEV proteins were annotated using BLAST2GO prior to class sorting via annotation and GO Terms. Wedges denoted as “Common,” were previously published in (Heavneret al.2017) and represent proteins found in bothLh14 andLhNY MSEV proteomes. New proteins analyzed in this work are in wedges labeled “Lh14 Only.” A majority of proteins belong to Class 1. Table S1 lists 246 proteins added to the supersetLh14 proteome. (B) and (C) Enrichment analysis of MSEV superset shows high association with exosomes and mitochondria compared to other cellular organelles according to Vesiclepedia. –log10(p-value) trend shown in orange for both graphs. The p-values were calculated with the Bonferroni method. (B) Percentage of MSEV genes associated with specific cellular compartments found in Vesiclepedia, relative to all MSEV genes. Of the superset proteins, 41 and 49% are associated with mitochondria and exosomes, respectively (P= 3 × 10−57; 1 × 10−53). (C) Fold-enrichment of the MSEV dataset in specific cellular compartments. Although many protein classes are present in the proteome, exosomal and mitochondrial proteins show more significant enrichments. The presence/absence of signal peptide (SP) alone, or SP with/without the transmembrane (TM) domain(s) in MSEV proteins reveals their possible location (i.e., potentially secreted into the venom gland lumen or associated with MSEV membrane). We therefore searched the 246Lh14 proteins for SP and TM domains. Of the 246 proteins, 55 (22.35%) have a predicted SP domain, 37 (15.04%) have a predicted TM domain, while 6 (2.44%) have both a predicted SP and TM domain. While most of the Class 1 proteins were annotated as ribosomal or mitochondrial-related, a few were described as integral membrane proteins, vesicle trafficking protein SEC22b (E-value: 6.22E-145), and the ion channels sideroflexin 1 and 2 (E-value: 0). We also identified an apolipophorin (E-value: 1.02E-7) (Table S1). The presence of these membrane-associated proteins reinforces the vesicular nature of MSEVs. Examples of Class 2 proteins include the neural/ectodermal development factor IMP-L2 (E-value: 5.29x10−50) and a protein involved in pain reception, CG9231 (E-value: 4.39x10−15). A viral-like Diedel protein (E-value: 1.77x10−7), viral Enhancin (E-value: 6.02x10−5), l(2)37Cc (E-value: 3.39x10−165), odorant binding protein 56d-like (E-value: 5.64x10−50), major royal jelly protein (E-value: 8.59x10−135), and two venom acid-phosphatases Acph-1 (E-value: 4.12x10−5) were also found in the Class 2 category; their cDNA sequences were published previously (Heavneret al.2013) (Table S1). It is possible that these MSEV proteins modulate the hosts’ immune responses and/or influence host development to facilitate successful parasitism. A BLASTp DELTA-BLAST of the potential gp350 domain against the nr database specifying “Vira” (taxid: 10239) under organism resulted in Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever orthonairovirus envelope glycoprotein (%ID: 30%, E-value: 2.5x10−1), Lymphocryptovirus Macaca gp350 (%ID: 29%, E-value: 7.2x10−1), and Gallid Alphaherpesvirus 1 envelope glycoprotein J (%ID: 26%, E-value: 1.2) as top hits. BLASTp DELTA-BLAST of the potential gp350 domain against the nr database for Hymenoptera yielded an uncharacterized protein as the best hit (%ID: 24%, E-value: 8x10−6) in the antVollenhovia emeryi. This ant protein is predicted to contain calcium-binding EGF domains. The second hit in this search is fromN. vitripennisfor a predicted mucin-3A like glycoprotein (Gendler and Spicer 1995) (%ID: 24%, E-value: 2x10−4). Interestingly, transcripts related to the potentialLhgp350-like protein are not found in theLborG. hookeritranscriptomes (Table S1) (Goeckset al.2013). Presence of this gp350-like protein inLhMSEVs, but its absence inLbMSEVs, suggests that it somehow contributes to differences inLh/Lbhost-parasite interactions and is therefore worthy of future studies. Complement receptor type 2 (CR2) in human B lymphocytes interacts with gp350 during Epstein-Barr infection (Younget al.2008) and finding a verified homolog of CR2 inDrosophilahosts would be interesting in future research. Do Lh MSEVs contain homologs of PDV or viral proteins? Even though figitidLeptopilinawasps are distantly related to PDV-containing Ichneumonid and Braconid wasps (Misofet al.2014;Strand and Burke 2015), an association of PDV-like viruses in figitid wasps cannot be discounted because of shared evolutionary history. Recent publications have identified capsid-less VLPs in Ichneumonidae wasps (Volkoffet al.2010;Pichonet al.2015;Burkeet al.2018) and it is possible thatLhMSEVs have a similar viral origin. We therefore analyzed theLhMSEV proteome superset against the GenBank PDV database, and then against its entire Viridae database. To identify false positives, MSEV proteins with positive PDV hits (E-values were less than 1.0x10−3, %ID was 20% or greater, and query coverage was 30% or higher) were also searched against the unrestricted nr database to compare relatedness. If an MSEV protein is similar to a viral or virus-related PDV protein, we expected that, in the unrestricted nr database search, the MSEV query sequence would align again with the same viral subject sequences, but with a lower E-value (Table S2). We also searched theLhMSEV superset for presence ofL. boulardiFilamentous Virus (LbFV) homologs (LbFV is a behavior manipulating virus ofLb(Varaldiet al.2006;Patotet al.2012)). Of LbFV’s 108 genes, 13 are present in genomes ofLb,Lhand related species, and the 13 transcripts are expressed in theLbvenom gland (Di Giovanniet al.2019). Within our thresholds, we obtained only three (of 13) sequences with similarity to LbFV ORFs. However, these threeLhMSEV proteins, with hits for LbFV sequences obtained better scoring hits in the unrestricted nr database, suggesting that theLhMSEV proteins are not highly related to the LbFV proteins (Table S2). The whole-body transcriptome contains expressed MSEV transcripts We performed a mixed-gender whole-body transcriptome sequencing andde novoassembly ofLhtranscripts. This assembly generated 104,066 transcripts. This dataset is more than three times larger than the published data derived from abdomens of female wasps that has 31,400 transcripts (Goeckset al.2013). A BLAST analysis of the female abdominal transcripts against the male/female whole-body transcripts showed that a majority (21,493/31,400, 68.4%) were present in the latter data set. Analysis of K-mer coveragevs.GC count. (A) Analysis of genomic reads. 27-mers generated from the cleaned Illumina reads used to assemble theL. heterotomagenome binned by their GC countvs.multiplicity (total counts among the reads). Bins are colored by the number of distinct K-mers. Different clusters are identified as shown and described in the text. (B and C): A map of 27-mer multiplicityvs.GC content of the joint assembly of theLh 14genome (B) to a map from the publishedL. clavipesgenome (Bioproject: PRJNA84205) (C). MSEV genes are encoded in the wasp genome The scaffolds containing MSEV genes (Fig. S1A) were also compared to a random subset of scaffolds without MSEV genes (Fig S1B) for their 27-mer/GC profiles. These appeared to not differ statistically (multivariate Cramér test statistic = 3755,P= 0.80, number bootstrap-replicates = 1000), indicating that the MSEV genes lie on scaffolds that resemble the rest of the genome. Characterization of select MSEV genes We spot checked small portions of the genome for gene structure predictions of MSEV virulence protein genesSmGTPse01(Class 2) andp40(Class 3). For this, we sequenced PCR products of gDNA corresponding to these genes. The cellular nature ofLhvesicles is likely to be shared by closely relatedLvandLbwasps. Our previous work has shown that the overall morphologies ofLhandLvMSEVs are similar (Moraleset al.2005;Chiuet al.2006). However, this is not the case forLbMSEVs; differentLbstrains have varying MSEV morphologies (Dupaset al.1996;Gueguenet al.2011;Wanet al.2019). Interpretation of their identity also varies. For example,Di Giovanniet al.(2019) contend that MSEVs/VLPs are derived from a virus ancestral to the LbFV. Our analysis of the expanded proteomic superset does not lend strong support to this line of thinking. We did not find convincing evidence of PDV or other viral structural proteins in theLhMSEV proteome. However, we cannot discount that MSEVs have a viral origin as our analysis is limited by the fragmentation of the genome. It is also possible that a virus related to MSEVs may not have been identified to date. Mechanistically, eukaryotic viruses and vesicles share cellular pathways involving the endomembrane systems of their cells of origin or their target cells (Nolte-‘t Hoenet al.2016), leading to overlap in protein functionality, but not necessarily origin. Thus, at least some of the Class 1 proteins in the MSEV proteome may be central to MSEV biogenesis in the wasp or for their interactions with the host hemocytes’ endomembrane machinery despite potentially being related to viruses. It is noteworthy that energy metabolism genes appear to be involved in rapid speciation and adaptation to new environments (Gershoniet al.2009;Lane 2009), raising the possibility that MSEV mitochondrial proteins might contribute to this process. HowLhMSEVs are functionally similar to other insect or mammalian EVs remains to be explored experimentally. Functional characterization of predicted infection and immunity Class 2 proteins should explain the immune-suppressive strategies of these wasps. RNA interference, infection assays, and other experimental strategies should make this line of inquiry feasible. Functional assignments are difficult for the unannotated Class 3 proteins. These are likely to be quite interesting, due to their different expression profiles inLhvs.LbandG. hookerispecies. This difference in expression may stem either fromcischanges in their regulatory sequences, or from absence of these genes in theLborG. hookerigenomes. Recent comparative genomics analysis has shown that over 40% of venom genes in the closely-related speciesN. vitripennisandN. giraultihave diverged significantly and up to 25% of venom genes are specific to a species (Martinsonet al.2017). A proteomic analysis of the venom genes ofLeptopilina spp. and a molecular understanding of their expression will provide insights into how key activities within MSEVs evolved to parasitize the range of fruit fly hosts. A key question regardingLhvirulence proteins critical to wasp success is whether their genes reside in a discrete region of the genome like a “virulence island” found in some microbial genomes (Dobrindtet al.2004;Gal-Mor and Finlay 2006), or whether some genes are dispersed within the genome, while others occur in one or more clusters as in wasps with PDVs (Volkoffet al.2010;Pichonet al.2015). More complete assemblies, scaffolded to the level of chromosomes, will describe the genome-wide distribution of these genes inLhand related wasps. Key MSEV genes could serve as genetic markers in future studies. Comparative genomics will uncover additional gene family members of MSEV proteins in otherLeptopilinawasps and enable the development of new functional genomics tools such as CRISPR-disrupted mutant alleles made inN. vitripennis(Werrenet al.2009;Siebertet al.2015;Liet al.2017b;Liet al.2017a). These approaches will open new avenues for understanding the biology of this host-parasite model. We thank Drs. W. Qiu and S. Singh, and J.
