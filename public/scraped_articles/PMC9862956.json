The model organismCaenorhabditis elegansis used in a variety of applications ranging from fundamental biological studies, to drug screening, to disease modeling, and to space-biology investigations. These applications rely on conducting whole-organism phenotypic assays involving animal behavior and locomotion. In this study, we report a 3D printed compact imaging platform (CIP) that is integrated with a smart-device camera for the whole-organism phenotyping ofC. elegans. The CIP has no external optical elements and does not require mechanical focusing, simplifying the optical configuration. The small footprint of the system powered with a standard USB provides capabilities ranging from plug-and-play, to parallel operation, and to housing it in incubators for temperature control. We demonstrate on Earth the compatibility of the CIP with differentC. eleganssubstrates, including agar plates, liquid droplets on glass slides and microfluidic chips. We validate the system with behavioral and thrashing assays and show that the phenotypic readouts are in good agreement with the literature data. We conduct a pilot study with mutants and show that the phenotypic data collected from the CIP distinguishes these mutants. Finally, we discuss how the simplicity and versatility offered by CIP makes it amenable to futureC. elegansinvestigations on the International Space Station, where science experiments are constrained by system size, payload weight and crew time. Overall, the compactness, portability and ease-of-use makes the CIP desirable for research and educational outreach applications on Earth and in space. Whole-organism phenotypic assays are a foundational tool for basic biology investigations, drug screening and disease-focused studies [1,2,3,4]. The nematodeCaenorhabditis elegansis particularly relevant for phenotypic screening due to its small size (≈1 mm), fast reproductive cycle (≈3 days), short lifespan (≈3 weeks), amenability to genetic manipulation and significant translational relevance [5,6,7]. Its small size and ease of culture offer the ability to phenotype large populations offering statistical power, which can be a challenge with vertebrate models. Whole-organism phenotypic readouts inC. eleganstypically involve examining animal behavior, locomotory prowess and survival in response to changes in environment [8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15]. The numerous advantages that underscore the use ofC. elegansas a genetic model on Earth also translate to its use in spaceflight as a cost-effective organism to understand the mechanisms underlying the effects of microgravity and radiation exposure on astronaut health. Indeed,C. eleganshave been flown several times to the International Space Station (ISS) [16,17,18,19,20]. The conducting of animal experiments on the ISS is associated with stringent operational requirements on payload size, weight, crew time and safety [21,22].C. elegansoffers a facile means to address these requirements, making it an efficient model for space-biology investigations. Standard microscopes have been the workhorse for image-based whole-organism phenotyping inC. elegans. The need to increase assay throughout and reduce costs has led to the development of a variety of bespoke imaging solutions. Approaches range from the use of scanners for parallel imaging of nematodes on agar plates [23,24] to compact do-it-yourself (DIY) systems based on Raspberry Pi cameras [25,26,27] and smartphones [10,28,29]. Scanners offer a convenient means to increaseC. elegansassay throughout, but are bulky and generate heat that requires significant customization to maintain temperature during the assay [23]. The Raspberry Pi camera approach offers on-board computation, making it attractive; however, it requires an external display for viewing and keyboard, which can be cumbersome, especially for ISS experiments. In this study, we report a small foot-print smart-device imaging system called Compact Imaging Platform (CIP) that can acquire videos ofC. elegansin agar plates, liquid droplets on a glass slide and microfluidic devices. The system has no external optical or mechanical elements, thereby reducing the complexity for imaging. The CIP is powered by USB and can be housed in standard incubators offering a plug-and-play approach for science investigations on Earth and in space. We conducted validation and mutant studies on Earth to show the promise of CIP forC. elegansphenotypic assays. 2.1. Description of the Compact Imaging Platform and Its Components Design of the Compact Imaging Platform and its functional capabilities. (a) The CIP consists of an imaging station to hold iPod Touch for imaging, aC. eleganssubstrate and a cooling fan for temperature control. It is powered by a 5 V USB cable. (b) The bottom section of the CIP showing the LED array and the USB component housing. (c) Multiple CIP units powered with a USB hub with the illumination turned on/off using a programmable timer. (d) Five CIP units stacked, operated in parallel and placed in an incubator with the timer. The imaging configuration of the CIP involves dark-field imaging ofC. eleganssamples by using a fixed-height illumination source and the iPod Touch camera. The white LED lights in the bottom section are secured along the four walls, providing sidewise illumination to the specimen. No external optical elements or mechanical focusing is needed, making the design simple and user friendly. Autofocusing is achieved using a 3rd-party app (FiLMiC Pro, Seattle, WA, USA) on the iPod Touch. This app also allows for adjustment of the magnification, field of view and frame rate of video acquisition. The fixed focal distance configuration gives a field of view of 15 mm × 23 mm to 38 mm × 68 mm depending on the optical 3x zoom available on the app. Videos can be acquired at 1080p resolution with a frame rate of 3–30 fps, or time-lapse imaging can be performed with a delay ranging from 1–60 s. A smart-device camera such as the iPod Touch was chosen not only because of its ease of use on Earth, but also because of the specific advantages it provides forC. elegansexperiments on the ISS. Unlike bulky conventional microscopy systems, it is a compact integrated imaging system that not only has optical elements for visualization, but also has a display (rather than a computer monitor) that allows the crew to inspect the animals and image quality. Additionally, the iPod Touch has the capacity to store up to ≈250 GB worth of data, allowing for recording of up to ≈810,000 images which enables short-term (e.g., about 1800 movies of 1.5 min duration at 5 fps) and long-term behavioral assays (e.g., about 45 h at 5 fps). Image acquisition aspects such as autofocusing and video capture rate can be easily controlled using the installed app. Finally, conducting science experiments with specialized hardware on the ISS requires significant astronaut training; however, the crew is familiar with using smartphone devices and associated apps, making our smart-device approach crew-friendly for spaceflight experiments. The CIP, integrated with the smart-device camera, is a 3 W (5 V, 0.6 A) low-powered system that can be battery operated if needed. The electrical requirement involves powering the LED lights and the cooling fan. Both elements are powered by a 5 V USB wall charger and a USB Type-A to Type-A cable. We chose this method because battery packs are available that can directly power our CIP using USB cables. This makes the CIP unit portable for field, educational and outer space applications. Thus, the operational simplicity of the CIP makes it attractive, compared to standard microscopes, to pursue phenotypic studies inC. eleganson Earth and for spaceflight studies. 2.2.

The images were processed using Image J V 1.53 (NIH, Maryland, USA), wrMTrck plugin. 2.3. Controlling CIP Temperature during C. elegans Assays C. elegans’behavior and survival is sensitive to temperature [34,35,36]. In addition, assays purposefully expose animals to different temperatures to investigate genes or compounds that impact thermotolerance [37,38]. Thus,C. elegansassays necessitate control over the environmental temperature. Often, the agar plates or microfluidic devices are kept in a temperature-controlled incubator and taken out for imaging on standard microscopes at room temperature. Alternatively, the temperature of theseC. eleganssubstrates are controlled by passive or active thermal management strategies. Scanners use fans to control temperature [23], while some studies have used Peltier elements integrated with microfluidic devices assays [39]. Controlling temperature of CIP. (a) Temperature was measured at the top of the microfluidic chip and in the LED chamber. (b) Temperature profile collected over 24 h at set incubator temperatures of 15 °C, 20 °C, and 25 °C. The temperature data of LED chamber and the microfluidic chip are nearly identical. (c) Table showing mean temperature and standard deviation from all the three collection points. 2.4.

Phenotypic Studies with Mutants C. eleganshas been an invaluable model organism for identifying the genetic basis of behavior and locomotion. There are many mutants that have been identified and classified based on automated image analysis, creating a behavioral database [44,45]. Since the CIP can accommodate a variety ofC. eleganssubstrates, it could be a useful tool to perform phenotypic studies with mutants. Here, we conduct a pilot study with a wild type and two mutants—unc-32(e189)andunc-79(e1068). Hierarchical clustering showed that these two mutants exist in a different phenotypic space in the behavioral database [45], thus forming a testbed to evaluate the capabilities of the CIP. Thrashing assay performed on day 5 animals using CIP. Wild-type animals showed significant difference compared to bothunc-79(p-value < 0.0001) andunc-32(p-value < 0.0001) mutants.n= 10 animals.; one-way ANOVA. Phenotypic studies with mutants using CIP.

Relevance of CIP for C. elegans Spaceflight Studies Significant physiological changes occur during long-duration space travel, necessitating a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms that induce these alterations [53,54]. Thus, model organisms such asC. eleganshave been flown to the International Space Station (ISS) several times for space-biology investigations [16,17,18,19,55,56,57,58,59,60]. For spaceflight missions where payload size and weight are critical considerations,C. elegansexperimental payloads offer a small-form factor and a significant reduction in weight compared with vertebrates. Moreover, the fast reproductive cycle enables multi-generational studies to be conducted, providing an opportunity to explore physiological adaptations due to long-term habitation in space. These advantages and mutant resources makeC. elegansa leading invertebrate animal model for spaceflight studies. Despite severalC. elegansstudies on ISS, most of the spaceflight data is limited to changes in gene expression and fluorescent markers, and there is a dearth of whole-organism phenotypic data. The major challenges for ISS investigations are the availability of microscopy hardware, access to crew time to conduct the studies, and payload weight/size requirements for imaging instrumentation. Standard microscopes available on ISS are bulky, require significant crew training, have a limited field of view to do large-population imaging, rely on bulky monitors for crews to visualize samples, and data store/transfer needs are demanding. These limitations necessitate the need for custom-designed imaging hardware for gathering whole-animal phenotypic data to understand the effects of microgravity and radiation onC. elegansphysiology. The compact imaging system developed in this study addresses the current limitations for phenotypingC. eleganson the ISS. The CIP has <1 kg payload requirement and occupies < 1 ft3. It is simple to use for crews and is a USB-powered plug-and-play device. The large field of view enables the interrogation of animal populations and provides a robust statistical evaluation of phenotypic data. Sample visualization and data storage needs are integrated into a small form-factor smart-device. Video data could be returned to Earth, and data analysis could be performed post-facto, thereby allowing the crew time to focus more on worm sample loading and basic payload handling. DifferentC. eleganssubstrates can be integrated into the CIP based on science requirements, and the microfluidic chips are particularly appealing due to their enclosed configuration that allows the maintaining of a sterile environment and efficient fluid handling. Nematode sample preparation usually occurs on Earth, with worm culture bags being flown to the ISS, where the crew extracts samples and injects into the microfluidic chips. The authors have recently flown to the ISS micropillar-based microfluidic devices for muscle strength measurements inC. elegans[20], and the CIP is a valuable addition to the imaging needs on the ISS. In this study, we report a compact imaging platform and successfully demonstrated that it can be used to acquire whole-organism phenotypic data using a variety ofC. eleganssubstrates. We show that good temperature control can be achieved for assays, and that multiple CIP units can be used if needed to conduct parallel experiments. The videos acquired are compatible for analysis with established software tools. TheC. eleganscommunity continues to develop a variety of open-source image analysis tools [61] that could be potentially used to analyze images acquired from the CIP to increase the depth of phenotyping. The hardware of CIP as demonstrated here could be further improved. In addition to the smart-device camera, additional high-magnification optics could be integrated to provide higher-resolution images to pursue deep phenotyping, including access to organ-level information. Although we used the iPod Touch in this study, the 3D-printed imaging station concept can be extended to other low-cost cameras (e.g., Arducam series), along with Raspberry Pi integration. Opportunities exist to integrate additional hardware elements to study animal response to stimuli such as light, temperature and electric fields, which will broaden the types of assays that can be conducted. With advances in computation and artificial intelligence, apps could be custom-designed to integrate with a smart-device that allows real-time image analysis, storage of assay metadata and data visualization. In summary, the CIP is a simple, versatile, low-cost and small-footprint phenotyping tool forC. elegansassays, that could be deployed in research and educational settings on Earth in its current form. The CIP also presents a proof of concept for future setups for space biology research and could be adapted for ISS-compatible hardware. In the future, the system needs to undergo thorough ISS certification in terms of flammability, materials, off-gassing, electromagnetic interface, etc., as the assessment of multiple factors like safety, system reliability and long-term storage for equipment performance is necessary. Worm culture.Animals were cultured in 60 mm nematode growth medium (NGM) petri plates with 150–200 µL E.ColiOP50 at 20 °C. Synchronized animals at day 5 from hatching were used in all the assays performed. For this paper, the strains used werewild-typeBristol (N2), CB189unc-32(e189) III., and CB1068unc-79(e1086) III. Microfluidic chip assay. Microfluidic devices were fabricated using standard SU-8 soft lithography techniques [62] in polydimethyl(siloxane). The design of the micropillar array is similar to that of Rahman et al., with a pillar diameter of 70 μm, gap of 90 μm and a chamber height of 110 μm. Animals were loaded inside the chip using a 1 mL syringe connected with a 0.032″ ID Tygon tubing (Cole-Parmer, Vernon Hills, IL, USA) with a stainless-steel coupler tube (Instech Labs, FL). Synchronized animals in an NGM plate were flooded with liquid NGM and then transferred to an empty plate. Using a syringe, approximately 65 animals were aspirated from the plate and loaded inside the chip using the loading port. The chip was then flushed with liquid NGM, followed by an addition of 20 mg/mLE. coli OP50. Thrashing assay. Synchronized animals in an NGM plate were flooded with liquid NGM and then transferred to an empty plate.
