The ability of terrestrial microorganisms to grow in the near-surface environment of Mars is of importance to the search for life and protection of that planet from forward contamination by human and robotic exploration. Because most water on present-day Mars is frozen in the regolith, permafrosts are considered to be terrestrial analogs of the martian subsurface environment. Six bacterial isolates were obtained from a permafrost borehole in northeastern Siberia capable of growth under conditions of low temperature (0 °C), low pressure (7 mbar), and a CO2-enriched anoxic atmosphere. By 16S ribosomal DNA analysis, all six permafrost isolates were identified as species of the genusCarnobacterium, most closely related toC. inhibens(five isolates) andC. viridans(one isolate). Quantitative growth assays demonstrated that the six permafrost isolates, as well as nine type species ofCarnobacterium(C. alterfunditum,C. divergens,C. funditum,C. gallinarum,C. inhibens,C. maltaromaticum,C. mobile,C. pleistocenium, andC. viridans) were all capable of growth under cold, low-pressure, anoxic conditions, thus extending the low-pressure extreme at which life can function. Because much of the water on present-day Mars exists in a permanently frozen state mixed with mineral matrix, permafrosts on Earth are considered to be terrestrial analogs of the martian environment (9). On the basis of similarities between martian regolith and terrestrial permafrost, we reasoned that permafrost might contain microbes capable of growth under low-PTA conditions. In this communication we report that screening ofca. 10,000 microbes obtained from four Siberian permafrost samples resulted in the isolation of six bacterial strains capable of growth under low-PTA conditions, and that all of these isolates belonged to the Gram-positive genusCarnobacterium.

Isolation from Siberian permafrost of bacterial strains capable of growing under simulated Mars conditions Growth of Permafrost Isolates Under Low-PTA Conditions. To further understand the effects of temperature, atmospheric composition, and pressure on permafrost isolates, the following experiment was performed, depicted inFig. 2. One hundred isolates from permafrost samples 4, 5, 8, and 9 were picked onto triplicate TSBYS plates. All plates were incubated at 0 °C for 30 d under different combinations of atmosphere and pressure. The TSBYS plate incubated at Earth atmospheric composition and pressure (i.e., low-T conditions) showed luxuriant colony development with a variety of different colony morphotypes, including distinctive orange colonies (Fig. 2A). On the replicate TSBYS plate incubated under anoxic atmosphere but Earth-normal pressure of 1,013 mbar (i.e., low-TA conditions) only one colony, number 43, was able to grow (Fig. 2B). This same colony was also able to grow at 7 mbar pressure under full low-PTA conditions (Fig. 2C); in fact, it seemed that colony 43 actually grew best under low-PTA conditions (compare inFig. 2 panelsA,B, andC). Isolate 43 was streak-purified and designated strain WN1359. Despite the fact that growth of the other 99 colonies was severely inhibited by 30 d of exposure to low-PTA conditions, all colonies recovered and grew rapidly (within 24 h) upon return to laboratory benchtop conditions (Fig. 2D). This result is in good agreement with previous observations that growth inhibition of microbes caused by exposure to low pressure is apparently nonlethal and rapidly reversible (7,10). Growth of 100 isolates from Siberian permafrost samples on TSBYS plates. Isolates are from permafrost sample 5 (colonies 1–25), 4 (colonies 26–50), 8 (colonies 51–75), and 9 (colonies 76–100). (A–C) All isolates were cultivated for 30 d at 0 °C under the following conditions: (A) Earth atmosphere and pressure. (B) Simulated Mars atmosphere, Earth pressure. (C) Simulated Mars atmosphere and pressure. Colony 43 from permafrost sample 4 was designated strain WN1359. (D) Same plate as inC, but after 1 additional day of incubation on the laboratory bench (i.e., at room temperature, Earth atmospheric composition and pressure). Identification of Permafrost Isolates asCarnobacteriumspp. Phylogenetic tree depicting the relatedness of permafrost isolates (gray boxes) toCarnobacteriumtype strains. The tree was constructed using the Tree Builder program on the Ribosomal Database Project server, usingDesemzia incertaas the outgroup. Numbers to the right of strain names are the GenBank accession numbers of the corresponding 16S rDNA sequences. Several of the distinctive orange colonies (Fig. 2) were also characterized by 16S rDNA sequence analysis as most closely related to the Gram-positive psychrophileExiguobacterium sibiricumstrain 7-3, which was previously reported to have been isolated from permafrost samples obtained from the Kolyma region by one of the authors (D.G.) (16). Although these isolates were unable to grow under low-PTA conditions (Fig. 2), this observation lent greater confidence that theCarnobacteriumspp. isolates described here indeed originated from permafrost and were not contaminants. Growth Kinetics of Permafrost Isolates andCarnobacteriumType Species Under Low-PTA Conditions. Bacterial strains used in this study ATCC, American Type Culture Collection; n/a, not applicable. Growth kinetics of permafrost isolate WN1359 on TSBYS at 0 °C and Earth atmosphere and pressure (circles); simulated Mars atmosphere and Earth pressure (triangles); and simulated Mars atmosphere and pressure (squares). Data are averages and SDs of triplicate determinations. From this work it can be seen that microbial communities from Siberian permafrost contain organisms capable of growing under conditions of low temperature, low pressure, and anoxic CO2-dominated atmosphere. It should be stressed, however, that low-PTA conditions are only a subset of the total potentially biotoxic physical factors constraining the survival or growth of terrestrial microbes on Mars, such as solar UV, extreme desiccation, solar particle events, and galactic cosmic rays. In addition, the martian regolith itself contains numerous potentially biotoxic factors, such as salinity, pH, and Eh of available liquid water; oxidizing soils created by UV-induced processes and soil chemical reactions; or the presence of heavy metals (discussed extensively in refs.7and17). Terrestrial life has evolved mechanisms to tolerate and indeed flourish in extreme high-pressure habitats such as the deep ocean (19), but very little is understood regarding microbial responses to low pressure, a physical constraint not found in nature on the Earth’s surface. The discovery of terrestrial bacteria that can inhabit cold, low-pressure, anoxic environments has implications for the fields of extremophile biology, astrobiology, the search for extraterrestrial life, and planetary protection. Permafrosts seem to be promising locations for the isolation of microbes capable of growth under cold, anoxic, and hypobaric conditions such as are encountered on Mars. It is anticipated that further sampling of permafrost from other locations or depths will yield additional microbes exhibiting this unique set of properties. Permafrost samples with a mean annual temperature of −7 °C were taken in the forest-tundra zone of northeastern Siberia (68.633°N, 159.079°E, the right bank of the Kolyma River) (Fig. 1) using a dry drilling rig that operates without fluids and prevents down-hole contamination (20). Four frozen soil samples, 4, 5, 8, and 9, were collected from the depths of 12.7, 16.5, 20.1, and 21.8 m below the surface, respectively. The strict protocols for drilling and the subsequent handling of cores were designed to ensure that uncontaminated material was retrieved (20). After removal from the corer, the surfaces of the cores (68- to 107-mm diameter) were cleaned by shaving off the outer layers with an alcohol-sterilized knife. For microbiological studies the cores were split into 5-cm-long segments, placed into sterile plastic bags, stored frozen in the field within a hole excavated in the permafrost, transported frozen to the Soil Cryology Laboratory in Pushchino, Russia, and then transported frozen by air to Kennedy Space Center, FL. The samples represent epigenetically frozen layers of Holocene age (6–8 kyBP) formed by refreezing of sediments that had melted and drained. They are hydrocarbonate-calcium fine-grained peaty sandy-loams, firmly bound by ice (ice content 25–37%), with pH close to neutral (6.8–7.2) and containing organic carbon (0.5–2.0%). The hypobaric system used for attaining low-PTA conditions has been described in detail (7). In brief, a 4-L polystyrene desiccator was placed in a low-temperature incubator set at 0 °C and connected to a low-pressure controller and vacuum pump (model PU-842; KNF Neuberger). Inoculated TSBYS plates were inserted into the desiccator, agar surface upward (i.e., not inverted). Six anaerobic pouches (model R681001 AnaeroPacks, Remel, Thermo Fisher Scientific) were placed inside with the vertically stacked plates. The system was then flushed with ultra-high-purity CO2and the desiccator sealed; this constituted anoxic atmosphere. The pressure inside the desiccator was either left at Earth-normal level (1,013 mbar) or pumped down to 7 mbar, the global average Mars surface pressure (5). At 7-d intervals the hypobaric chamber was vented to laboratory atmosphere, samples removed for assay, the anaerobic pouches replaced, and the system returned to test conditions. The anaerobic pouches have been shown to reduce the O2concentration to <0.1% within 1 h (21). All plates were maintained for up to 30 d at 0 °C. Two microliters of a fresh overnight culture made in liquid TSBYS (containing from 5 × 104to 5 × 106cells) were spotted in triplicate onto TSBYS plates and incubated under low-PTA conditions. At weekly intervals, agar blocks containing the cell spots were cut out of the plates with a sterile scalpel and placed individually into 1 mL of sterile PBS (10 mM potassium phosphate and 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5). Cells were suspended by vortexing, diluted serially 10-fold, and plated for viable cells on TSBYS plates incubated at room temperature. Numbers of generations (n) were calculated using the equation where N1and N2are the number of cells per spot at 0 and 4 wk, respectively (22). Molecular Taxonomy of Strains by 16S rDNA Analysis. Chromosomal DNA was purified and 16S rDNAs were amplified and sequenced as described previously (23). 16S rDNA sequences were used to query the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) database (24) (http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/). The phylogenetic tree was built with the RDP Tree Builder using the Weighbor weighted neighbor-joining tree-building algorithm. All 16S rDNA sequences have been deposited in GenBank under the accession numbers denoted inFig. 3.
