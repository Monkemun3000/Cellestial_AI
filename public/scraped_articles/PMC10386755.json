This article is an open access article distributed under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). The first genome sequenced of a eukaryotic organism was forSaccharomyces cerevisiae, as reported in 1996, but it was more than 10 years before any of the zygomycete fungi, which are the early-diverging terrestrial fungi currently placed in the phylaMucoromycotaandZoopagomycota, were sequenced. The genome forRhizopus delemarwas completed in 2008; currently, more than 1000 zygomycete genomes have been sequenced. Genomic data from these early-diverging terrestrial fungi revealed deep phylogenetic separation of the two major clades—primarily plant—associated saprotrophic and mycorrhizalMucoromycotaversus the primarily mycoparasitic or animal-associated parasites and commensals in theZoopagomycota. Genomic studies provide many valuable insights into how these fungi evolved in response to the challenges of living on land, including adaptations to sensing light and gravity, development of hyphal growth, and co-existence with the first terrestrial plants. Genome sequence data have facilitated studies of genome architecture, including a history of genome duplications and horizontal gene transfer events, distribution and organization of mating type loci, rDNA genes and transposable elements, methylation processes, and genes useful for various industrial applications. Pathogenicity genes and specialized secondary metabolites have also been detected in soil saprobes and pathogenic fungi. Novel endosymbiotic bacteria and viruses have been discovered during several zygomycete genome projects. Overall, genomic information has helped to resolve a plethora of research questions, from the placement of zygomycetes on the evolutionary tree of life and in natural ecosystems, to the applied biotechnological and medical questions. The first “land” fungi retained their flagella for motility and remained adapted to life in water, and several diverging lineages switched to multicellularity while exploiting new environments [1]. A hallmark of the process of adapting to terrestrial life was the loss of the flagellum, which occurred independently several times during fungal evolution, giving rise to fungi with a hyphal growth form [2]. Prominent among early-divergent fungi is a group of lineages historically known as the zygomycetes, which are unified by similarities in reproductive biology (e.g., the formation of sexual zygospores via undifferentiated gametangia) and mostly do not form macroscopic fruiting bodies, making them more difficult to study thanDikarya[3]. Zygomycetes have also been challenging to study because many species are involved in obligate symbiotic interactions and have not been successfully grown in pure culture [4]. However, subsequent molecular studies have shown that the zygomycete fungi are paraphyletic [5]. Today, zygomycetes are recognized as two independent monophyletic groups divided into six subphyla [6]. Terrestrial environments posed novel challenges to early fungi, and the adaptive solutions that these lineages evolved can today be gleaned from the vast library of genes contained within their genomes [7,8]. While these first land colonizers are now extinct, many of their features are preserved in the genomes of extant zygomycetes. One instance, in which whole-genome data have proven useful, is in understanding the origin and evolution of fungi. About 450 million years ago, combined activities of fungi and plants placed the terrestrial world on a trajectory toward its current state, setting the stage for subsequent evolutionary transitions. Primitive mycorrhiza-like relationships and other forms of fungal–plant associations helped facilitate the successful colonization of land by the first terrestrial plants, and the genes responsible for such interactions are still preserved in fungal genomes [9]. Hence, zygomycete genomes have and will continue to play an integral role in our current understanding of the initial transition of organisms to land [10]. Distribution of sequenced genomes among genera. Different shades of green and brown—Mucoromycota; purple and blue—Zoopagomycota. Axenic cultures remain the preferred and most straightforward method of obtaining high-molecular-weight genomic DNA for sequencing projects [19]. Typically, the easier a species is to grow in culture, the easier it is to obtain pure, unfragmented DNA of high quality. In some cases, however, DNA from a single cell or even nuclei can be extracted and sequenced. This technique has been especially successful for the mycoparasites or fungal parasites of animals (e.g.,Piptocephalis,Stylopage, andZoopage[11,20,21]) or for resolving questions on genetic diversity of the nuclei inGlomeromycotina, such asRhizophagus[22]. When neither culturing nor single-cell genomics is possible, fungal DNA can be extracted along with that of the host organism. The two genomes can be distinguished bioinformatically (e.g., in the case ofEntomopthoralespathogens of insects [23]). In rare cases, high-quality tissue from field-collected fruiting bodies can be used to generate genomes (e.g.,Endogone,Jimgerdemannia, andModicella[12,14,24]). Approaches used in the generation of zygomycete genomes: sequencing (upper panel) and assembly (lower panel) technologies. Different shades of green and brown—Mucoromycota; purple and blue—Zoopagomycota. Genome statistics for zygomycete sequences. Sizes of the genomes and number of the genomes sequenced since 2005 (upper left), number of contigs in assemblies (upper right), estimated sequencing depth coverage relative to the single genome (lower left), and the number of the predicted genes (lower right). Different shades of green and brown—Mucoromycota; purple and blue—Zoopagomycota. Genome quality is also improved by increasing the sequence coverage. Some zygomycete genomes have been sequenced at a depth of 500–700× and many genome projects aim for a mean depth of ca. 100× coverage (Supplement Table S1). High-quality genome assemblies rely on increased sequencing depth, particularly in cases of high intraspecific polymorphism or variable genome architecture, e.g., species ofGlomeromycotinaand many noncoding regions and transposons, as in the genomes ofEntomophthoromycotinaspecies. However, some researchers have used low-coverage genome sequencing (ca. 10× coverage) as a cheap and efficient method to obtain a smaller number of orthologous gene regions for phylogenomic analyses [12,15,24]. 3. Genomes and the Evolution of the Zygomycetes One of the greatest debates in early-diverging fungal evolution was the ploidy of the dominant life form given the predominantly haploid nature seen in theDikarya. One outcome of the analysis of genome sequences of zygomycetes species is that diploids are more common than expected [9,55,56,57]. Mucoromycotacomprises many critically important plant symbionts, including the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (Glomeromycotina) [58],Endogonales(Mucoromycotina) [24], “fine root endophytes” (Mucoromycotina) [59], and putative root endophytic species includingMortierella(Mortierellomycotina) [60],Pygmaeomycetaceae(Mucoromycotina) [61], andUmbelopsis(Mucoromycotina) [62]. On the other hand, many fungi within this group are also noted plant pathogens (e.g.,Rhizopus microsporus, which causes rice seedling blight, and variousChoanephora,Gilbertella, andMucorspecies that cause post-harvest rots) as well as numerous species (Actinomucor,Apophysomyces,Cokeromyces,Cunninghamella,Lichtheimia,Mucor,Rhizomucor,Rhizopus,Saksenea,Syncephalastrum) that can cause the disease mucormycosis in humans and other animals [63]. Distributions of the number of genomes sequenced imposed onto phylogenetic tree. Different shades of green and brown—Mucoromycota, purple and blue—Zoopagomycota. This subphylum contains an estimated 170 species [96] and was recently circumscribed into 13 monophyletic genera using multi-locus and low-coverage genome sequencing [12]. Reference genome sequences of both low quality and high quality are now available for representatives for most genera, includingActinomortierella,Benniella,Dissophora,Entomortierella,Gamsiella,Gryganskiella,Linnemannia,Lobosporangium,Lunasporangiospora,Mortierella,Necromortierella,Podila, and the sporocarpic genusModicella[12,97]. A high diversity ofMortierellomycotinaspecies can be isolated from soil, but it appears that genera may differ in their ecological roles. For example,Necromortierellaspecies appear to be necrotrophic, whereasActinomortierellaspp. are often associated with millipedes, andEntomortierellaspp. are often associated with arthropods [98]. Many genera, such asLinnemanniaandPodila, have been recovered as rhizosphere associates and endophytes of plant roots [99,100], and they appear to improve plant growth and impact flower and seed production [101]. Several species such asMortierella alpinahave been sequenced due to their use in industry and biotechnology for lipid production [102]. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMFs) are arguably the most common and oldest symbionts of terrestrial plants [58], credited with the role in the facilitation of plant transition to the terrestrial habitat [103]. AMFs supply their plant hosts with mineral nutrients translocated from the soil in return for plant-assimilated carbon [104]. Yet, there are not many genomic sequences of these organisms available due to historical impediments hampering sequencing projects, including multinucleate spores with different genotypes, obligate biotrophy of AMFs, and the initial uncertainty concerning their genome sizes, with conflicting size estimates inRhizophagus irregularisranging from 14.1 [105] to 154.8 Mb [106]. Once these obstacles were surmounted, genomic data confirmed that AMFs have unusually large genomes, ranging from 153 Mb inR. irregularis[26] to 773.1 Mb inGigaspora margarita[107]. This size enhancement relative to otherMucoromycotais driven by lineage-specific expansions of gene families and massive proliferation of transposable elements [26,86,107]. Genomic data also revealed that AMFs display several other features that differentiate them not only fromMucoromycotabut also from other fungi. For example, despite the lack of morphological evidence of sexual reproduction, theR. irregularisgenome harbors a candidate mating-type locus with two genes encoding homeodomain-like transcription factors [108]. If these homeodomain-like genes indeed control sex, then regulation of the reproductive processes in AMFs would resemble mating inDikaryarather than inMucoromycota, which rely on HMG domain proteins for sex determination [109].Rhizophagus irregularisdiffers also from other fungi in the organization of its rRNA operons. Instead of being tandemly arrayed as they are in other fungi, the rRNA operons inGlomeromycotinaare dispersed individually across the genome [26]. This important discovery put an end to a long-lasting debate on whether intraindividual rRNA gene variation typical for AMFs is distributed among dissimilar nuclei [110] or contained in each nucleus [111], supporting the latter scenario. Lastly, genome-based inferences of metabolic capacity revealed that AMFs lack the gene encoding fatty acid synthase [112,113,114], which makes them obligately dependent on plant hosts for lipids [115,116,117,118]. As in other fastidious organisms, this information is important for devising cultivation strategies that complement fatty acid auxotrophy of AMF [119,120]. Even though accumulation of genomic data for AMF has lagged behind otherMucoromycota, the insights gathered so far have been critical for resolving several puzzles in the biology of these unique organisms. PacBio HiFi and Hi-C sequencing of all available AMF heterokaryons helped to discover the two sets of coexisting homologous chromosomes in one heterokaryon. Genes required for plant colonization were found in gene-sparse, repeat-reach compartments [121]. Another important question that remains to be addressed is which genomic features of AMFs contribute to superior yield outcomes in agronomic crop species, as AMFs do not universally benefit all plant hosts. This subphylum contains an interesting mix of mycoparasites (Dimargaritales), putative saprotrophs (Kickxellales), and obligate insect endobionts (Asselariales,Barbatosporales,Harpellales, andOrphellales). TheDimargaritalesare similar to mycoparasites in theZoopagalesin that they form penetration hyphae (haustoria) and mostly attack similar host species in theMucoromycota. In contrast to theZoopagalesmycoparasites, species ofDimargaritalesappear to be rare in the environment and have mostly been isolated from dung rather than soil. Recent genomic analyses have also highlighted that members of theDimargaritalesthat have larger genomes and more predicted secondary metabolite genes compared to their close relatives [15,129]. Furthermore, single-cell genome data have suggested thatDimargaris cristalligenamay be nonhaploid and missing certain enzymes from metabolic pathways (e.g., thiamine biosynthesis and biotin metabolism) [11]. Identifying such genomic features of symbiotic species can provide targets for further experimental tests to understand the molecular interactions between hosts and parasites. On the other hand, theKickxellalesis the only group ofZoopagomycotacontaining mostly saprotrophic species, and many appear to be rare in the environment, having only been reported in the literature one or a few times. An exception is the genusCoemansia, the species of which are commonly isolated from soil and dung samples [4,130]. Genome sequencing efforts have demonstrated thatKickxellalesspecies have small genomes (less than 40 MB) and variability in their predicted secondary metabolite genes, withCoemansiaandLinderina, along with more polyketide synthases than otherKickxellalesandD. cristalligenahaving more nonribosomal peptide synthetases than otherKickxellales[129]. A preliminary rDNA phylogeny showed polyphyly amongKickxellales[130], and a large-scale sequencing project that utilized low-coverage genome data from >100 isolates to test these hypotheses, as well as explore the diversity ofCoemansiaspecies, resolved many of these relationships [15]. The gut fungi (Trichomycetes) include arthropod symbionts for which several draft genomes have been available since 2016 [131]. These fungi are distinct from the saprotrophic and coprophilic relatives (i.e.,Kickxellales) and belong to four distinct phylogenetic lineages—Asellariales, Barbatosporales,Harpellales, andOrphellales[132].Asellarialesare associated with isopods and spring tails (Collembola) [133]. Species within the three genera (Asellaria,Baltomyces, andOrchesellaria) have been recovered from the both terrestrial and aquatic hosts [133], but their phylogenetic relationships remain unclear, as sequence data have only been obtained fromAsellaria[132], and no cultures are available for this group. Harpellalesspecies are usually found in lowerDipterainsect larvae and have coevolved with their hosts for over 200 million years [134]. Species ofOrphellalesare stonefly nymph symbionts with unusual morphological characters (i.e., asexual and sexual spore shapes, and thalli protruding beyond the anus of insect hosts) [135], which cluster together with otherTrichomycetesand theSpiromycetalesfor a sister clade toKickxellales[15].Smittiumis a well-studied genus withinHarpellaleswith approximately 100 described species [136]. However, there are only nine whole-genome sequences available for these insect gut-dwelling fungi, and all were made from culturableHarpellalesspecies, with the best assembly—Capniomyces stellatus—having 72 scaffolds [131].Barbatosporalesare monotypic, and the single species (Barbatospora ambicaudata) has only been recorded from black fly larvae collected in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee, obtained in axenic culture [137]. Although we only have a handful ofHarpellalesgenomes, they have already expanded our knowledge and understanding of these enigmatic microbial fungi in multiple ways. For example, a mosquito-like polyubiquitin gene has been identified inZancudomyces culisetae(Harpellales), which was presumably acquired via a horizontal gene transfer event [127]. Comparative genomics revealed a fungus–insect symbiotic core gene toolbox (FISCoG) that is shared among the insect-associated fungi (e.g.,Harpellales,Basidiobolus, andConidiobolus) and higher-rankedHypocreales(Ascomycota). However, the insect pathogens (HypocrealesandEntomophthoromycotinamembers) tend to have genomes enriched in genes that are useful for pathogenic processes such as the platelet-activating factor acetyl-hydrolase coding genes, whereas the gut commensals have genomes enriched in cell adhesion genes for a successful gut-dwelling lifestyle [128]. In addition,Harpellalesgenomes also facilitated a kingdom-wide study to confirm the production of selenoproteins in early-diverging fungal lineages [138]. As a major group of early-diverging fungi, representing seven of the nine fungal species that utilize selenoproteins,Harpellalesmay take the advantages of selenocysteine over cysteine for specific oxidoreductase functions. Unfortunately, no efforts have been successful in obtaining genome information of theAsellariales,Barbatosporales, andOrphellales, which colonize different host types. However, multigene analyses incorporating low-coverage genome data (along with data fromAsellarialesandOrphellales) suggested an alternate hypothesis for the evolution of fungal–insect associations. Contrary to previous topologies that suggested multiple events [132], the larger dataset showed a possible single origin of gut fungi [15]. Further evolutionary evidence may be identified with the help of their genome sequences to understand how these gut-dwelling microbial fungi interact with various aquatic insect hosts and evaluate the origins of the symbiosis. Zoopagomycotinaspecies are fascinating, partially due to their cryptic ecological niches and ability to parasitize various hosts such as amoebae, nematodes, rotifers, and other fungi. It is still challenging to culture most of theZoopagomycotinaisolates. Thus, it is not surprising to see that theZoopagomycotinahas the lowest number of available genomes, the qualities of which are not comparable to other lineages, especially the well-sequencedMucoromycotina. Recently developed single-cell genomic techniques have provided an alternative, culture-independent method to obtain their genomic information [11]. On the basis of single-cell or multiple-cell libraries, the completeness of genome assemblies can be as high as 89.6% (Piptocephalis tieghemianaRSA 1565) [20]. The assembledZoopagomycotinagenomes indicate that this clade of fungi is characterized by small genome size, but the numbers of protein-coding genes are not necessarily low. Some of the genomes can encode close to 10,000 genes (e.g.,Zoophagus insidians, a predator of rotifers and nematodes (Supplement Table S1). It seems likely that these completely microscopic fungi are capable of more complicated and yet-to-be identified interactions with their animal and/or fungal hosts, but more work will be needed to explore these interactions. Two additionalZoopagaleshave remarkably small genomes: a species ofAcaulopage(11 Mbp) and a species ofZoopage(14 Mbp). No genomes have yet been published for the following genera:Amoebophilus,Aplectosoma,Bdellospora,Brachymyces,Cystopage,Endocochlus,Euryancale,Helicocephalum,Reticulocephalis, andSigmoideomyces. 4.1. Adaptation to Terrestrial Life Inferred from Genomes The transition to a terrestrial environment placed novel constraints on species of early-diverging fungi, especially in terms of their resistance to desiccation and solar radiation. Genomes have been essential to studying which zygomycete genes made this transition possible. Sensing of and response to light have been explored in the modelMucoralesspeciesPhycomyces blakesleeanus. Mutants impaired in photoresponses, especially phototropism, were isolated as reported in the 1970s [142]. However, the first genes related to photoresponses were not reported until 2006 [143]. These were identified using a candidate gene approach in whichP. blakesleeanuswas assumed to have similar blue light sensors as theDikaryaspecies [143,144], wherein a two-protein complex was first identified inNeurospora crassa, defining a sensing and signaling system that uses a light-sensing domain coupled to transcription factor roles for signal transmission. With the release of theP. blakesleeanusgenome sequence in 2010, identifying a candidate gene formadBas encoding the interacting protein was achieved using BLAST against the genome sequence [145]. The genome sequence was performed along with that ofM. circinelloidiesand revealed an expansion of this pair of genes required for light responses (3–4 copies of each). Being able to make targeted gene mutations inM. circinelloidesof these homologs, as based of genome sequence information, provided a clear example of subfunctionalization after gene duplication [146]. The identification of the mutations inmadIandmadCmutants inP. blakesleeanusused traditional genetic mapping with molecular markers derived from the comparison of the genomes between two strains. With the regions narrowed, candidate genes could be identified and confirmed by sequencing [64,147]. These genes play conserved roles in photobiology in theDikaryaspecies, suggesting that this innovation for terrestrial life had already evolved in early-diverging fungal lineages. For instance, phenotypic analysis of theP. blakesleeanus madAandmadBmutants indicated that this pair of genes has a conserved function in protecting fungi from harmful ultraviolet light [148]. In addition to responding to light, manyMucoralesspecies can sense gravity. This has been correlated with the formation of vacuolar crystals inP. blakesleeanus[149]. Through purification of such crystals, followed by mass spectrometry of the associated proteins using the mass database derived from the genome sequence, the OCTIN protein was identified. A gravity-insensitive mutant had a mutation within the corresponding gene. Remarkably, phylogenetic comparison revealed that the origin of the gravity-sensing gene OCTIN in theMucoraleswas most likely via a horizontal gene transfer from a bacterial species [150]. Other challenges associated with terrestrial life, such as fluctuations in temperature and desiccation, have yet to explored from a genomic standpoint among zygomycetes. Some of the early diverging lineages such asGlomeromycotinaandMortierellomycotinalack ergosterol, what can increase their membrane stiffness [77,112]. Ergosterol has long been considered as one of the regulators of dry–wet cycles [151]. Symbiotic associations with highly coevolved endocellular bacteria stand out among the most prominent features differentiatingMucoromycotafrom other fungi, including theDikarya[152,153,154]. Thus far, most of these endosymbionts have been identified as representatives of two bacterial families,BurkholderiaceaeandMycoplasmataceae. While some of theMucoromycotaassociations with bacteria are mutually beneficial for both partners, in others, the fungi appear to be negatively impacted by their endosymbionts. The application of “omics” tools has been essential in elucidating the molecular underpinnings of the mutualism betweenGlomeromycotinaand their ancient and uncultivable endosymbiont “CandidatusGlomeribacter gigasporarum” (CaGg,Burkholderiaceae) [155]. In this symbiosis, CaGg improves hyphal proliferation in the presymbiotic growth stage of the host fungus [156], which can be attributed to endobacteria-mediated reprograming of the fungal metabolism [157,158]. “Omics” approaches were also critical in understanding the biology and devising a cultivation strategy forMycoavidus cysteinexigens(Burkholderiaceae) [159], a cysteine auxotroph and ancient antagonistic endosymbiont ofMortierellomycotina[69,160,161]. Comparative genomics also revealed that “CandidatusMycoavidus necroximicus” produces several nematocidal metabolites that protect the fungal hostMortierella verticillatafrom feeding by nematodes [162]. Endobacteria have also been shown to regulate and control mating and asexual reproduction inRhizopus microsporus[163], produce toxins (rhizoxin) that enable pathogenicity on plants, and provide protection from predators [164], as well as potentially protect fungal spores from the human immune system via anti-phagocyte activity [165]. The ease of partner manipulation in the mutualism betweenR. microsporusandMortierellaceae(Mucoromycotina) andMycetohabitansspp. (formerlyBurkholderia) [166,167] elevated this association to a model system for studying fungal-bacterial symbioses [163,168]. While the symbioses ofMucoromycotawithBurkholderiaceaeendobacteria are well characterized for some species,Mucoromycotaassociations withMycoplasmataceae, referred to asMollicutes- or mycoplasma-related endobacteria (MREs) [169,170], are only beginning to be unraveled. MREs have been detected in all three subphyla ofMucoromycota:Glomeromycotina[169],Mortierellomycotina[171], andMucoromycotina[24,172]. MREs ofGlomeromycotinaare classified as “CandidatusMoeniiplasma glomeromycotorum” (CaMg) [173]. Genomic features of CaMg have been examined in depth [66,174], including evidence of gene acquisition from fungal hosts. However, the role of CaMg in the biology ofGlomeromycotinaremains uncertain. Naito et al. [174] speculated that CaMg is an antagonist ofGlomeromycotina. If this is confirmed, then CaMg would resemble the lifestyle of the MREs associated withMortierellomycotina[171]. Moreover, bacterial–fungal interactions seem to be much more common and diverse than previously thought [175], andMucoromycotarepresentatives are no exception. Telagathoti et al. [176] showed recently that 30% ofMortierellalesisolates were associated with different groups of bacteria. Another survey ofMucoromycotacultures from soil indicated diverseParaburkholderia-related sequences detected with 20% frequency fromMortierellaandUmbelopsisstrains [154]. The ecological meaning of these interactions remains to be described. Outside of theMucoromycota, however, the importance or prevalence of endosymbiotic bacteria remains less clear. Despite bacterial sequences always present in the environmental samples of entomophthoralean fungi (A.P. Gryganskyi, personal observation), nothing is known about their connection to the entomopathogens and their role in pathogenic processes that impact insects. However, six recently constructed metagenome assemblies of four various bacterial species in connection withMassospora cicadinamight indicate their symbiotic relationship to this entomopathogenic species [177]. AmongZoopagomycotina, Davis et al. [20] detected 16S sequences with close matches toMycoavidus cysteinexexigensin the genome ofStylopage hadra(nematode parasitic fungus). A recent genomic assessment ofKickxellomycotinafungi did not reveal any obvious colonization by endosymbiotic bacteria [15], suggesting that these bacterial associations might be less important or prevalent inZoopagomycotathan inMucoromycota. 4.3. Secretomes, Gene Clusters, and Secondary Metabolites All fungi explore and exploit their environment by secreting various substances. The secretome composition of basal fungal lineages was shaped by diversification early in their evolution. Characterization of secretome compositions of 132 zygomycete genomes revealed that current trophic mode plays a less significant role as compared to the phylogenetic relationships of the fungi [178]. This is in part becauseMucoromycotaandZoopagomycotaeach had their own unique lineage-specific expansion of secreted digestive enzymes, according to their historical substrate differences and their different evolutionary trajectories [178]. Genomic screenings of available genomes for novel natural compounds also show promising potential [179,180,181]. These screenings discovered the presence of gene clusters harboring polyketide synthases (PKS), non-ribosomal peptides, terpenoids, and L-tryptophan dimethylallyl transferases with transcription factor coding genes in proximity to some of the gene clusters. Since then, NRPS clusters have been detected in someMortierellomycotinaandMucoromycotina. For example, the mycelium ofMortierella alpinaproduces diverse novel compounds [182]. Similarly, the transcripts corresponding to PKS and NRPS were recently described in transcriptomes of fiveMucorspecies [183].Mucor circinelloideswas shown to produce carotenoids and terpenoids [180], and the genes associated with terpene biosynthesis were identified recently inMucorandRhizopusgenomes [74]. Siderophore production has been reported fromGlomus[184],Apophysomyces[185],Rhizopus[186], andBasidiobolus[129]. Rhizoferrin fromRhizopus delemarhas been further characterized and showed a glycosylation pattern [187] that was classified as a member of the sodium (Na)–iodide symporter gene family [186]. The best-studied compound isolated from early diverging fungi is an antimitotic agent called rhizoxin produced by an endosymbiotic bacterium (Mycetohabitans rhizoxinica) and encoded by a huge NRPS–PKS cluster [166]. The genome of amphibian gut symbiontBasidiobolusis enriched with the genes and gene clusters involved in the production of secondary metabolites through horizontal gene transfer from bacteria [129]. Genomes of mycoparasiticDimargaritales(Kickxellomycotina) are also enriched for secondary metabolites [15], especially when compared to mycoparasiticZoopagomycotina(PiptocephalisandSyncephalis) whose genomes appear depauperate in these genes [129]. These groups of mycoparasites are very similar in their morphology and ecology; thus, the reasons underpinning the observed difference in metabolite genes remain unclear. Transposable elements (TEs) are abundant in zygomycete genomes [79]. Genomes ofEntomophtorales,Basidiobolales[129], andEndogonales[24] are particularly rich in TEs, while species ofUmbelopsidales[188] andZoopagomycotina[11] have very few. Genomes ofRhizopusspecies comprised approximately 40% repetitive sequences with only ~10% potentially active elements [84]. In taxa with more compact genomes such asUmbelopsis isabellina, transposons account for as little as 5% of their genome size. In contrast,Jimgerdemannia flammicoronacan have more than 77% of its genome occupied by repetitive elements and transposons [24]. In most of the analyzed genomes, long terminal repeat retrotransposons from the Ty3/Gypsy family dominate the TE landscape [84].Mucoromycotina,Kickxellomycotina, andBlastocladiomycotapossess transposons with a tyrosine recombinase from a gene family which seem to be lost inDikarya[78]. While the function of mobile elements in zygomycete genomes is not well understood, in Ascomycota, large mobile elements (termed “starships”) may carry a variety of genes (e.g., secondary metabolites, virulence factors, and heavy-metal tolerance) and contribute to the overall variation in genome structure [189,190]. There has been renewed research interest in the zygomycete fungi during the last decade, and this is reflected in the rapidly increasing number of genome sequences from this group of fungi. While the quality of the genomes varies according to the sequencing platform and starting materials available, the genomes are sufficient for phylogenomic reconstructions, as well as for the discovery of functional genes and gene clusters of interest. Much of the work has focused on several key topics, including the evolution and phylogeny of the group, adaptation, and transition to a terrestrial habitat (e.g., light and gravity sensors, and reinforcement of cell-wall structure to tolerate a nonaquatic environment), genome duplication, endosymbionts and horizontal gene transfer, genome architecture, pathogenicity, and coevolution with host species. The number of genomes has grown rapidly over the past decade, and we expect that the next decade will bring increased taxon sampling (e.g., new genomes for taxa that have not yet been sampled) and improvements in genome quality due to advances in long-read sequencing technologies and bioinformatics approaches. In the future, we expect that genomic analyses of these fungi will take new directions, including a detailed comparison of the genomes of aquatic vs. terrestrial lineages, structural studies, a comparison of the zygomycete vs.Dikaryagenomes, experimental manipulations of host/parasite interactions to understand the molecular mechanisms underpinning pathogenesis, and building links among genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data. The authors declare no conflict of interest.",
