N6-threonylcarbamoyl-adenosine (t6A) is one of the few RNA modifications that is universally present in life. This modification occurs at high frequency at position 37 of most tRNAs that decode ANN codons, and stabilizes cognate anticodon–codon interactions. Nearly all genetic studies of the t6A pathway have focused on single-celled organisms. In this study, we report the isolation of an extensive allelic series in theDrosophilaortholog of the core t6A biosynthesis factor Kae1.kae1hemizygous larvae exhibit decreases in t6A that correlate with allele strength; however, we still detect substantial t6A-modified tRNAs even during the extended larval phase of null alleles. Nevertheless, complementation ofDrosophilaKae1 and other t6A factors in corresponding yeast null mutants demonstrates that these metazoan genes execute t6A synthesis. Turning to the biological consequences of t6A loss, we characterize prominentkae1melanotic masses and show that they are associated with lymph gland overgrowth and ectopic generation of lamellocytes. On the other hand,kae1mutants exhibit other phenotypes that reflect insufficient tissue growth. Interestingly, whole-tissue and clonal analyses show that strongly mitotic tissues such as imaginal discs are exquisitely sensitive to loss ofkae1, whereas nonproliferating tissues are less affected. Indeed, despite overt requirements of t6A for growth of many tissues, certain strongkae1alleles achieve and sustain enlarged body size during their extended larval phase. Our studies highlight tissue-specific requirements of the t6A pathway in a metazoan context and provide insights into the diverse biological roles of this fundamental RNA modification during animal development and disease. Beyond the four canonical ribonucleosides present in RNA, nearly all life forms bear an array of modified bases in various transcript populations. Over 100 chemical modifications have been documented, with dozens often present in individual species; the majority of distinct modified ribonucleosides occur on tRNA (Machnicka et al. 2013). Altogether, RNA modifications collectively play diverse roles in RNA quality control, secondary structure, transcript stability, translational efficiency, translational fidelity, and regulation of RNA–protein interactions (Gu et al. 2014;Hopper and Huang 2015) and can influence disease and cancer progression (Grewal 2015;Kirchner and Ignatova 2015). While many post-transcriptional modifications of RNA are broadly conserved, only a few are universal across known life forms. One prominent example isN6-threonylcarbamoyladenosine (t6A), which is found at high frequency at position 37 of tRNAs that decode ANN codons (Grosjean et al. 1995). This modification was recognized decades ago, and it stabilizes cognate codon–anticodon interactions through a stacking interaction that stabilizes the weak interaction with the first codon base, which comprises a weak A–U pair (Weissenbach and Grosjean 1981;Yarian et al. 2002;Agris 2008). However, the enzymes that generate this modification remained elusive until relatively recently. Based on the inference that all organisms harbor t6A-modified tRNAs (Sprinzl and Vassilenko 2005), bioinformatic isolation of universally conserved genes of unknown function (Galperin and Koonin 2004) yielded a short list of candidate genes that first led to the identification of YrdC/Sua5 as a t6A pathway component (El Yacoubi et al. 2009). Subsequently, members of the universal gene family Kae1/Qri7/YgjD were recognized to be essential for t6A biosynthesis, along with its partner proteins (in yeast) Pcc1 and Bud32 (El Yacoubi et al. 2011;Srinivasan et al. 2011). Of note, mutations in components of the Kae1, Pcc1, Bud32, and Cgi121 complex (collectively termed KEOPS) had been isolated some years earlier, via divergent approaches intended at identifying factors in telomere maintenance (Downey et al. 2006) and splicing/transcription (Kisseleva-Romanova et al. 2006). At the time, the molecular role of the KEOPS complex was obscure, but its deep conservation justified solving the atomic structures of the archaeal Kae1/Bud32 natural fusion protein (Hecker et al. 2008) and the entire eukaryotic KEOPS complex (Mao et al. 2008). These studies assigned Kae1 as an ASKHA-type ATPase, Bud32 as a kinase, and Pcc1 as a dimerization subunit, with Kae1 physically interacting with both Bud32 and Pcc1. Only later, with the recognition that these genes are involved in t6A accumulation, did efforts become possible to reconstitute the biosynthesis of t6A-modified tRNA in vitro, using purified bacterial YrdC (Sua5) and YgjD (Kae1) and two bacterial-specific genes that cluster with YgjD, namely YjeE and YeaZ (Deutsch et al. 2012). Similarly, yeast Sua5 and KEOPS complex sufficed to generate t6A-modified tRNA in vitro (Perrochia et al. 2013). The proposed mechanism is that Sua5 converts bicarbonate and threonine via a series of intermediates into threonylcarbamoyladenylate, which is transferred to the active site of Kae1 within the KEOPS complex to modify tRNA position A37. Notably, Kae1 is the only truly universally conserved component of KEOPS (Galperin and Koonin 2004), and eukaryotes contain a paralog of Kae1 termed Qri7 that is mitochondrially localized (Huh et al. 2003). The fact that no other KEOPS components localize to mitochondria led to a suspicion that Qri7 represents a primal core factor that does not require additional presumably accessory KEOPS components. Indeed, subcellular redirection of Qri7 to the cytoplasm rescued the slow growth phenotypes of all KEOPS members that are defective for t6A accumulation (Wan et al. 2013). Moreover, in vitro synthesis of t6A-modified tRNA was reconstituted solely with purified Sua5, Qri7, and substrate tRNA, in the presence of threonine, bicarbonate, and ATP (Wan et al. 2013). Thus, Kae1/Qri7 is the central downstream enzyme in the generation of t6A-modified tRNA. The assignment of core genes in the t6A pathway permits organismal phenotypes to be correlated with the absence of these modified tRNAs. Budding yeast t6A pathway mutants (El Yacoubi et al. 2009,2011;Srinivasan et al. 2011) are very slow-growing, while the bacterial pathway (e.g., inBacillus subtilisandEscherichia coli) is essential for viability and cell morphology (Arigoni et al. 1998;Handford et al. 2009). These seemingly general defects befit loss of a fundamental RNA modification pathway, but do not lend insight into particular processes. Otherwise, mutants of KEOPS complex members in single-celled organisms have impact on telomere maintenance (Downey et al. 2006), transcription (Kisseleva-Romanova et al. 2006), and genome stability (Oberto et al. 2009), although it remains unclear how directly the loss of t6A relates to these phenotypes. However, certain phenotypes now seem to be directly related to the biochemical function of t6A in improving translational fidelity. Of note, yeastsua5was originally isolated as a suppressor ofcyc1alleles harboring an aberrant upstream start codon (uORF) (Hampsey et al. 1991;Na et al. 1992), implicating Sua5 in start site selection; AUG is indeed recognized by a t6A-modified tRNA. Correspondingly, Sua5 affects various aspects of normal translation, as mutants exhibit increased leaky scanning through AUG, frameshifting, and nonsense suppression (Lin et al. 2010). One prominent locus controlled via endogenous uORFs is the amino acid starvation-responsive transcription factor GCN4 (Hinnebusch 2005). Indeed, not only doessua5derepressGCN4, KEOPS mutants (kae1andpcc1) induce a gene expression signature that is substantially enriched for Gcn4 targets (Daugeron et al. 2011). These precedents suggest that it may be possible to make linkages between altered translation and organismal phenotypes, even for this “housekeeping” cellular activity. To date, genetic analysis of t6A pathway components has mostly been limited to single cell organisms, such as microbes and yeast. One study on theDrosophila melanogasterBud32/PRPK homolog utilized RNAi-mediated knockdowns to define growth related defects uponbud32depletion, although biochemical evidence was not presented for an impact on t6A biogenesis in this condition (Ibar et al. 2013). Interestingly, the growth defects were related to PI3K/TOR signaling, and could be partially restored by expression of activated S6-kinase (Ibar et al. 2013). In this study, we describe the isolation of a large allelic series ofD. melanogaster kae1mutants, ranging from weak hypomorphs, strong mutants, to null alleles. These present various growth-related defects, developmental delay, and melanotic tumors. We present extensive biochemical and genetic evidence thatDrosophila kae1and its partners are core factors in t6A biogenesis. Notably, our phenotypic analysis reveals substantial differences in the genetic requirements for t6A in proliferating versus nonproliferating tissues. In particular, analysis of mitotic tissues in full knockout and in clonal settings indicates an essential requirement forkae1, whereas various nonproliferating tissues can be maintained in the null state for weeks. Moreover,kae1appears to act as a tumor suppressor in the larval hematopoietic tissue. These data highlight biological complexity in the requirements of a general regulatory factor, and the utility of theDrosophilamodel to further understand the roles of t6A modification during animal development and disease. Isolation of the “Black Spot” complementation group Black Spotmutants affect theDrosophilaortholog of Kae1 To identify the gene mutated inBlack Spotmutants, we usedP-element mapping (Zhai et al. 2003) to narrow the region of interest within the deficiency (Supplemental Fig. 2). Coding exons from genes in the region were amplified by PCR from DNA extracted from hemizygous mutant larvae and sequenced. We identified one locus (CG4933), the fly ortholog ofKae1, that harbored nonconservative changes in all eight alleles (Fig. 2A). Subsequently, we identified two uncharacterized mutants in 72F-73A (l(3)72Fb[209]andl(3)72Fb[331], V Bedian, pers. comm. to FlyBase) that failed to complementBlack Spotmutants. Sequencing showed that thel(3)72Fballeles exhibit missense and nonsense mutations inCG4933, respectively. Notably, whilel(3)72Fb[209]mutates a residue in the ATP-binding pocket, none of the other point mutations directly affect any functionally characterized regions (e.g., other residues that bind ATP or metal ion, or Kae1 faces that bind its partner KEOPS proteins Pcc1 or Bud32,Fig. 2A). Finally, we found thatPBac{WH}CG4933[f01978], which carries a piggyBac insertion into theCG49335′ UTR (dos Santos et al. 2015), also failed to complementBlack Spotmutants. These observations strongly support thatCG4933corresponds toBlack Spot. Consistent with this, qRT-PCR analysis of several independent point mutants showed moderate decreases inCG4933transcripts, and these were undetectable inf01978hemizygotes (Fig. 2B,C). Summary ofDrosophila kae1 (CG4933)mutant alleles. (A) An alignment of fruit fly, human, yeast, and archaeal orthologs of Kae1. Functionally/structurally defined regions are highlighted, including the binding regions for Pcc1 and Bud32, and the ATP- and ion-binding regions. AllBlack Spotalleles recovered from our screen revealed that point mutations affected well-conserved residues. Notably, none of the mutations directly affects a known functional site, although a few mutations are in the vicinity of such regions. The noncomplementing allelel(3)72Fb[331], identified from a public stock collection, bears a nonsense mutation inkae1. Note that 1A2 and 1A19 induce the same coding change, even though these were isolated from different chromosomes in the screen. (B) qRT-PCR analysis ofkae1from various homozygous or hemizygous mutants. All of our point alleles maintain substantial levels of kae1 transcripts, although several of them are reduced by 20%–30%. The pBac insertion into the 5′ UTR ofkae1,f[10978], appears to be a null allele as no transcript was detected. (C) Agarose gel analysis of qRT-PCR amplicons confirms the absence ofkae1transcripts inf[10978]/Dflarvae. To confirm thatBlack Spotphenotypes were functionally due to loss ofCG4933, we generated untagged and GFP-tagged genomic transgenes using theP[acman]backbone. Both CG4933 constructs rescued independent lethal hemizygotes (1A13andf01978) to adult viability, and no melanotic masses were observed in rescued animals (e.g.,Figs. 1E,3and other data not shown). In summary, we have isolated metazoan mutants ofkae1, encoding a universal tRNA modification factor, representing the first extensive allelic series of a t6A pathway factor in any organism. Analysis of t6A-modified tRNAs in yeast KEOPS andDrosophila kae1mutants. (A) Analysis of yeast t6A pathway mutants is shown as a control. Primer extension assays yield a ladder of bands indicating the presence of stalled products. These include a band at position A37 of tRNA-Ile[AAU] of wild-type yeast that is strongly depleted in yeast t6A pathway mutants, thus indicating a t6A-modified nucleoside. tRNA-Val[UAC] is shown as a control for a non-t6A-bearing substrate. The ladder positions are inaccurate due to incomplete digestion; therefore, sizes are labeled according to the input primer. (B) Analysis ofDrosophila kae1mutants. Modifications of the A37 positions of tRNA-Met[CAU] and tRNA-Ile[AAU] are decreased although not eliminated in two strong hemizygous conditions ofkae1. The reduction observed inkae1[1A13]/Dfwas rescued by aP[acman]-kae1genomic transgene (“kae1+”). Note that mutant larvae were collected at an advanced age in their extended larval period to separate them from potential maternal contributions; the normal larval period ends at ∼5 d. (C) LC-MS/MS analysis of total tRNAs fromDrosophila kae1hemizygous mutant larvae. We observe a minor decrease in total t6A-modified tRNAs in the hypomorphic allele[7A9]and stronger decreases in the strong/null alleles[f01978]and[1A13]. The levels of t6A-modified tRNAs did not decrease further in exceptionally long-livedkae1mutant larvae, and the loss of t6A was rescued by akae1genomic transgene. Decrease, but not elimination, of t6A-modified tRNAs inkae1mutants Genetic and molecular complementation of yeast t6A mutants withDrosophilaorthologs. (A–C) Single complementation tests. The schematic depicts the transformations of cognate yeast genes and their fly orthologs, assayed for complementation ofsua5(A),kae1(B), andbud32(C) null mutants. Comparison of single colony sizes indicates substantial growth rescue by fly proteins, although not as robust as the yeast counterparts. (D,E) Double complementation tests. The schematics depict combinations of fly orthologs assayed for complementation ofkae1(D) andbud32(E) null mutants. Improved growth rescue by supplying combinations of fly factors was noticeable, particularly forDrosophila kae1 + bud32. (F) Primer extension analysis demonstrating molecular rescue of t6A-modified tRNA-Ile by yeast and fly factors. (G) Mass spectrometry analysis of total yeast tRNAs.kae1mutant yeast has borderline detectable levels of t6A-modified tRNAs, which are restored by complementation with yeastKAE1and byDrosophilaKEOPS genes. Consistent with the behavior in yeast growth (D) and in primer extension assays (F), the combination ofDrosophila kae1 + bud32conferred the best rescue of t6A-modified tRNAs. Inspection of modENCODE data (Brown et al. 2014) shows thatDrosophila kae1is ubiquitously expressed but present at highest levels in ovaries and the early blastoderm embryo, indicating its strong maternal deposition. Some maternal gene products can support organismal processes for days (Lecourtois and Schweisguth 1995;Lu et al. 2000), and tRNAs themselves are typically expected to be relatively stable (Hanoune and Agarwal 1970), although loss of some tRNA modifications is documented to render tRNAs unstable (Alexandrov et al. 2006). Because of these considerations, we sought to extend the analysis ofkae1zygotic mutants as late as possible. Bearing in mind that normalDrosophilacomplete their larval stages by ∼5 d, we collected RNA from 12-d and 18-dkae1mutant larvae. However, we did not observe further decreases in the level of t6A-modified tRNAs even at these extended timepoints (Fig. 3). To provide a global assessment on the amount of t6A-modified tRNAs inkae1mutants, we purified total tRNA, enzymatically hydrolyzed the tRNA to ribonucleosides, and analyzed these using liquid chromatography-coupled triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using a dynamic MRM method (Su et al. 2014). This analysis showed a mild (∼10%) decrease of t6A-modified tRNAs in hemizygotes of the weak allelekae1[7A9], and more substantial decreases (∼40%) in hemizygotes of the strong/null alleleskae1[1A13]andkae1[f01978](Fig. 3C). We also observed full restoration of t6A-modified tRNAs in LC-MS/MS analysis ofP[acman]-CG4933/+; kae1[1A13]/Dflarvae, consistent with the viability rescue conferred by the genomic transgene. Together, these observations provide evidence thatkae1is required for normal accumulation t6A-modified tRNAs in a metazoan setting. We cannot rule out that the remaining modified tRNAs are exceptionally stable. However, quantitative analysis did not reveal further decrease of t6A-modified tRNAs inkae1[f01978]/Dfbetween 6- and 12-d larvae, suggesting that perdurance is not the major underlying cause of the remaining t6A. An alternate scenario is that they are contributed by the mitochondrial pool, which is presumably generated by the mitochondrial Kae1 paralog Qri7 (annotated asDrosophilaCG14231). We note that Qri7 generates only a minute fraction of total t6A-modified tRNAs in yeast (Srinivasan et al. 2011), suggesting a potential difference between these eukaryotic species. DrosophilaSua5/KEOPS genes complement corresponding yeast null mutants Because the fly null mutants did not fully eliminate t6A, we sought supporting evidence on the role ofDrosophilaKae1 in this pathway. Therefore, we conducted genetic replacement assays in a simpler heterologous host system, namely, inS. cerevisiaemutants in t6A pathway genes. As described, these are slow-growing but can be maintained in the null condition and are nearly completely deficient for t6A (El Yacoubi et al. 2011;Srinivasan et al. 2011). To judge the overall relationship of the fly orthologs to their yeast counterparts, we tested for direct complementation of several yeast t6A mutants (Fig. 3A) by theirDrosophilaorthologs. We cloned the open reading frames forDrosophila kae1,bud32, andsua5into the yeast expression plasmid, pADH416. Because yeast mutants in these three genes grow very poorly (Srinivasan et al. 2011), we transformed theDrosophilaexpression constructs into the corresponding yeast heterozygous diploid mutants. As controls, the same diploids were transformed with plasmids expressing the yeast protein, and with an empty vector. The transformed diploids were sporulated and then dissected to yield haploid segregants. Haploids containing plasmids expressing theDrosophilaor yeast protein, or the empty vector, were identified and then streaked to individual colonies on selective medium. Rescue of t6A-modified tRNAs in yeastkae1mutants byDrosophilaKEOPS factors We performed biochemical analysis of tRNA modification in mutant and rescued yeast. Primer extensions using a probe against tRNA-Ile[AAU] recapitulated strong loss in the A37 band inkae1mutant yeast transformed with an empty vector, which was fully restored by theS. cerevisiae KAE1expression construct (Fig. 4F). Comparison with yeast transformed with various combinations ofDrosophilaKEOPS factors showed strong agreement between growth properties and accumulation of t6A. That is, we observed moderate rescue by flykae1alone, but much stronger improvement by including other members of theDrosophilaKEOPS complex (Fig. 4F). kae1mutants exhibit aberrant hematopoietic development and activity Having established the role ofDrosophilaKae1 and its partners in t6A biosynthesis, we sought to examine the nature of developmental defects caused by absence of this tRNA modification pathway. We began with the analysis of the namesake “Black Spots,” which resemble phenotypes associated with derangement in the development and/or deployment of the hematopoietic system (Minakhina and Steward 2006). Therefore, we investigated the status of the lymph gland as well as circulating blood cells in the hemolymph. We first examinedkae1[1A13]/Df(3L)ED220larvae, which exhibit a strong molecular defect in t6A biogenesis (Fig. 3C) and generate “black spots” with nearly complete penetrance (Fig. 1A). The hemolymph of control TM6B sibling third instar larvae exhibit normal distributions of blood cells (Fig. 5A), primarily plasmatocytes (identifiable as ∼10 µM diameter cells) and more rare lamellocytes (40–50 µM diameter cells). In contrast, hemolymph smears of ∼10-d-oldkae1[1A13]hemizygous larvae showed increased density of blood cells, and in particular, massive overrepresentation of lamellocytes (Fig. 5B). We also identified large circulating aggregates that resembled lymph gland fragments (Fig. 5C), as well as apparent phalloidin-rich tumors that were packed with lamellocytes (Fig. 5D). The latter could be melanized and were identifiable as “black spots,” but they were not necessarily pigmented, suggesting they had not yet initiated the melanogenesis cascade. Hematopoietic overgrowth and blood cell defects inkae1mutants. All samples were stained with Hoechst (blue) to label DNA and rhodamine phalloidin (red) to label F-actin; all scale bars, 50 µm. Control animals were TM6B siblings of crosses used to generatekae1/Df(3L)ED220larvae and are thus heterozygous forkae1. (A) Control hemolymph shows the typical profile in which most circulating hemocytes are plasmatocytes ([P] asterisks). (B)kae1[1A13]hemizygous hemolymph shows increased density of blood cells, as well as numerous lamellocytes, often present in clusters ([L] arrowheads). Lamellocytes (∼40–50 µm in diameter) are larger than plasmatocytes (10 µm in diameter). (C) Large aggregates bearing organized structure were observed in circulation as were overt tumors that are packed with plasmatocytes and lamellocytes (D). The latter correspond to the melanotic masses observed in live “black spot” larvae. (E–H) Anterior lobe of lymph gland from third instar in control (E) and from agedkae1/Df(3L)ED220larvae (F–H); the dorsal vessel (DV) is labeled. Thekae1mutants exhibit strong overcommitment to lamellocyte fate in the lymph gland (F) and typically have overgrown lobes (G). Frequently, the anterior lobe was observed in the process of dispersal or was detached entirely from the dorsal vessel (H). (I–L) Analysis of anterior lymph gland lobes in second instar larvae. Compared with control (I), allkae1mutants exhibit ectopic lamellocytes (J–L). The hypomorphs[1A2](J) and[1A13](K) are relatively normally sized, but the null[f01978](L) is strongly overgrown. (M,N) Analysis of mitotic cells (labeled with anti-phospho-Histone H3, green) in posterior lobes of lymph glands from control (M) and[1A13]/Df(N). Thekae1mutant has overgrown posterior lobes that harbor more actively dividing cells. As mentioned, mostkae1mutants exhibit a vastly extended larval stage. Thus, we considered it plausible that the enlarged lymph tissues developed progressively over this aberrant larval period. To ask whetherkae1mutants exhibit defects during the normal course of larval development, we examined[1A2](weak),[1A13](strong), and[f10978](null)kae1hemizygotes at the second instar. We observed overrepresentation of lamellocytes in anterior lymph gland lobes in all genotypes, although[1A2]was not overgrown and[1A13]was only slightly enlarged relative to control (Fig. 5I–K). However,[f10978]exhibited both considerable overgrowth and ectopic commitment to lamellocyte fates (Fig. 5L). This is despite the fact that[f10978]develops modest frequencies of black spot compared with[1A13](Fig. 1), indicating that hematopoietic tumors can exist without melanization of nodules. We also note that[f10978]exhibit lymph gland overgrowth despite the comparably small size of these larvae (Fig. 1), indicating partial uncoupling of organism size and individual organ size. Essential requirement forkae1in imaginal discs but not throughout the larval CNS A conspicuous aspect of the strongkae1alleles were their nearly complete absence of imaginal discs. These begin as small cell populations that are set aside in the embryo, and proliferate during larval stages to increase their numbers ∼1000-fold (Milán et al. 1996), generating the tissues that will form the adult structures during metamorphosis. We mounted larval brain-imaginal disc complexes from wild-type and two strongkae1mutants for comparison (Fig. 6A–C). Discs were completely absent in most larvae, or at best yielded tiny tissue rudiments that might potentially be discs, but cannot confidently be assigned to any particular disc identity. In contrast, the CNS was slightly smaller but remained present. Closer inspection revealed that the optic lobes were strongly reduced in size inkae1mutants, whereas the ventral nerve cord (VNC) was less affected (Fig. 6A–C). Notably, the optic lobes are the main proliferating centers in the larval CNS, whereas the VNC is primarily composed of post-mitotic neurons. Differential requirements ofkae1in mitotic and nonproliferating larval tissues The clonal analyses caused us to evaluate more carefully the extent to which different tissues were affected inkae1mutants. It is clear thatkae1-deficient cells exhibit growth defects in some contexts. Nevertheless, our original isolation ofkae1mutants as extremely long-lived larvae exhibiting hematopoietic expansion (Fig. 1) indicates that many cells and tissues can not only survive, but seemingly thrive in thekae1null state for weeks. For example, differentiated post-mitotic blood cells such as lamellocytes (Krzemien et al. 2010) are both overrepresented and actively functional in encapsulation during the extended larval phase ofkae1mutants (Fig. 5D; Supplemental Fig. 4). We surveyed other tissues that were maintained inkae1mutant larvae, including the gut (Supplemental Fig. 5), salivary glands (Fig. 7A–F), fat body, and somatic musculature (Fig. 7G–I). For the most part, all of these tissues are dominantly or solely composed of nonproliferating cells during the larval stages. Therefore, these observations solidify the notion that mitotic cells are preferentially affected by loss ofkae1. However, this does not mean that defects were lacking in these other larval tissues. Interestingly, quantitative analysis showed tissue-specific and allele-specific differences between their behavior. For example, even thoughkae1[1A13]/Dfmutants maintain only marginally more t6A thankae1[f10978]/Dfmutants (Fig. 3C), we observed progressively smaller salivary glands inkae1mutants with less t6A (Fig. 7J). More strikingly, the size of salivary gland cells was mostly unaffected in[1A13]hemizygotes, whereas they were tiny by comparison in[f10978]hemizygotes (Fig. 7K). Thus, the slight amount of t6A in a strongly hypomorphickae1condition can maintain salivary gland cell size, even though these glands evidently have fewer cells than normal, whereas the null condition compromises both cell and organ size in the salivary gland. In contrast, the absolute size of the body wall musculature is largely unaffected inkae1[1A13]/Df, and only slightly reduced in thekae1[f10978]/Dfmutants (Fig. 7L,M). Indeed, the small size ofkae1null larvae (Fig. 1E) may be sufficient to explain the small size of its muscles, which are expected to scale to body size. Differential requirements ofkae1in mitotic vs. nonproliferating tissues. Larval tissues were analyzed fromkae1[1A13]andkae1[f01978]hemizygotes, which fully lack imaginal discs (Fig. 6). (A–I) Immunostaining of dissected tissues, using DAPI (blue) and phalloidin (red). (A–F) Salivary glands (and some attached fat bodies) imaged at 10× to visualize entire glands (A–C) and at 20× to emphasize individual cell sizes (D–F). (G–I) Body wall musculature. Selected muscles VL1-4 and LO1 are labeled. The length of a body segment is denoted with the double arrow lines. (J) Quantifications of salivary gland sizes (n= 10 all genotypes) and (K) salivary gland cell sizes (n= 15 cells from the distal tip measured in each of eight glands, all genotypes). Althoughkae1[1A13]/Dflarvae exhibit severe defects in mitotic tissues, the overall salivary gland size and cell size are more modestly affected. The null allelekae1[f01978]is severely compromised in both aspects of the salivary gland. (L) Quantifications of VL1 muscle length and (M) VL2 muscle length.kae1[1A13]/Dflarvae exhibit normal muscle sizes, while the null allele is only ∼40% reduced. Error bar shows standard error; all statistical analyses were unpaired Student'st-tests. (N–P) Adult eyes bearing Gal4 driver alone (N) or expressingkae1-RNAiunder control ofey-Gal4(O) orGMR-Gal4(P). The former is active in the proliferating eye primordium, whereas the latter is active in post-mitotic photoreceptor neurons. (Q,R) Third instar eye-antennal imaginal discs stained for DAPI, Cut (green, to label cone cells) and Elav (red, to label photoreceptors). Compared to the control disc (Q), depletion ofkae1usingey-Gal4induces severely defective eye development. All scale bars, 200 μm. Distinct effects of depletingkae1in mitotic and post-mitotic contexts of an individual tissue Cellular analysis demonstrated that depletion ofkae1usingey-Gal4caused developmental defects. Compared to the normal size and differentiation status of normal third instar eye discs, stained for the photoreceptor marker Elav and cone cell marker Cut,ey-Gal4 > UAS-kae1-RNAidiscs exhibit rudimentary eye discs with disturbed patterning (Fig. 7Q,R). On the other hand, knockdown withGMR-Gal4did not affect larval eye development (data not shown). Therefore,kae1is critically required in mitotic, but not in post-mitotic, eye cells. Confirmation of the t6A modification pathway in a metazoan To date, nearly all studies of the t6A biogenesis pathway have been conducted in unicellular organisms such as bacteria or yeast. The first functional study of a metazoan t6A component involved knockdown of the mitochondrial Kae1 paralog Qri7 (OSGEP-L) inCaenorhabditis elegans, which induced defective mitochondrial morphology and function (Oberto et al. 2009). Subsequently, a knockdown study of theD. melanogasterBud32/PRPK reported growth defects relating to defective TOR signaling (Ibar et al. 2013). However, neither study assessed biochemical defects in t6A accumulation per se. Furthermore, knockdown approaches do not generally achieve genetic null states. Previous characterization of yeastkae1mutants (El Yacoubi et al. 2011;Srinivasan et al. 2011), which we confirm here, showed nearly complete absence of t6A-modified tRNAs. This raises two general possibilities. First, it may be that t6A-modified tRNAs are exceptionally stable inDrosophila. In this scenario, even though we assayed timepoints going well past the established range of maternal effects (e.g., up to 18 d, or the equivalent of a week-old adult fly), those modified tRNAs that were maternally deposited or generated from maternalkae1mRNA and/or protein persisted all that time. Alternatively, many species, including yeast andDrosophila, express a mitochondrial Kae1 paralog named Qri7. Although mitochondrially derived t6A appears to comprise a minute portion of the total pool in single-celled organisms, the situation might be different in a metazoan. For example, the substantial populations of nonproliferating tissues that tolerate deletion ofkae1include the larval musculature, which sustain larval locomotion in mutants for weeks. Therefore, the remaining t6A-modified tRNAs inkae1null mutant larvae may potentially be contributed by the abundant mitochondria in muscles. In the future, characterization of aDrosophila Qri7(CG14231) knockout would provide a useful comparison, especially to see if Qri7 loss preferentially affects tissues with exceptional needs for oxidative phosphorylation. An extensive allelic series ofkae1mutants reveal diverse biology of t6A The first allele in a t6A biogenesis component, yeastsua5-1, was isolated in a forward genetic screen as an extragenic suppressor of a mutantcyc1allele bearing an aberrant uORF (Hampsey et al. 1991). UV and X-rays were used as mutagens in these screens, and cloning ofsua5-1revealed a single-base substitution resulting in an S107F missense alteration (Na et al. 1992). Subsequently, other genetic efforts hit various KEOPS components of the t6A pathway, but these studies utilized screening of a deletion collection (Downey et al. 2006) or a multicopy suppressor scheme (Kisseleva-Romanova et al. 2006). All of these studies pre-dated the connection of Sua5/KEOPS factors to t6A biogenesis, and for the most part, studies have focused on generation of straight or conditional knockout alleles (Arigoni et al. 1998;El Yacoubi et al. 2009,2011;Handford et al. 2009;Srinivasan et al. 2011). We describe the first extensive set of point mutations in a t6A pathway component. These mutations sort along a comprehensive allelic series that includes null alleles, strong mutants, and weak hypomorphs. We document allele-specific phenotypic severities in different tissues, and also note that biochemically strong hypomorphs exhibit modest phenotypes in some settings (e.g., exhibit normal somatic musculature) but phenocopy null alleles in other settings (e.g., completely lack imaginal discs). These discrepancies highlight the utility of the allelic series in dissecting multiple requirements of essential housekeeping genes in regulating fundamental cellular processes in vivo. Future studies can continue to exploit these alleles to elucidate the biology of t6A modification. For example, it remains unclear what underlying causes provoke the dramatic hematopoietic responses inkae1mutants, and our alleles provide unique means for querying this. Of note, substantial hematopoietic overgrowth is observed in both strong hypomorphs and the null condition, but only the former proceeds reliably toward generation of melanotic nodules. Thekae1alleles we report should also be valuable for understanding the mechanism of t6A modification. Extensive structural studies delineate the Kae1 active site and binding surfaces with its partners Pcc1 and Bud32 (Hecker et al. 2008;Mao et al. 2008;Wan et al. 2013;Zhang et al. 2015). Interestingly, only one of our many point mutations directly affects any of these functionally characterized regions (Fig. 2A). This highlights the usage of a forward genetic screen to identify relevant mutations. This mutant collection can be utilized as a basis of structure-function studies to assess how these uncharacterized residues might affect formation of the KEOPS complex, productive t6A transfer, or potentially the specificity of substrate tRNA recognition. Differential requirements of t6A in proliferating and nonproliferating cells Studies of the biology of t6A modification pathway in metazoan systems are only in their infancy. The Glavic group reported foundational studies using transgenic RNAi againstDrosophila Prpk/Bud32(Ibar et al. 2013), and their recent work (Rojas-Benitez et al. 2015) and our current study extend this to genuinekae1mutants. There are general similarities between the phenotypes of fruit fly and unicellular organism mutants, in that these genes are lethal (as in bacteria) and exhibit substantially defective growth (as in yeast). Of course, one of the major opportunities specifically available in higher eukaryotes is to examine potential cell- and tissue-specific requirements. Here, we find evidence for differential requirements forkae1in distinct cell types. Quite noticeably, strongkae1mutants completely lack imaginal discs. The progenitor populations of discs are set aside during embryonic development, and they proliferate extensively during larval stages to generate the tissues that will form the adult body plan during metamorphosis. Although we cannot precisely assess the timing of effective depletion of maternal stores of t6A-modifed tRNAs (i.e., that are directly deposited into the oocyte, or that are generated via maternally depositedkae1mRNA and/or protein), our clonal studies demonstrate a timely impact on removal of thekae1genomic locus. That is, even though there exists substantial likelihood of Kae1 and t6A-modified tRNAs inherited from the mother cell prior to mitotic recombination,kae1mutant disc cells are quickly disadvantaged and rapidly removed during the course of normal development. Overall, we note thesekae1phenotypes are strikingly similar to certain otherDrosophilamutants. For example, we and others previously characterized mutants of the central E1 and E2 enzymes in the SUMO pathway (the heterodimeric pair Aos1/Uba2 and Ubc9, respectively), and these develop a range of defects that are strikingly similar to what we documented forkae1mutants. Phenotypes common to loss of Kae1 and SUMO include extended larval phases before lethality, presence of melanotic tumors, and preferential defects in mitotic versus nonproliferating cells, as evidenced by their lack of imaginal discs while retaining diverse other larval tissues (Kalamarz et al. 2012;Kanakousaki and Gibson 2012). Similarly, a number of zygotic cell cycle mutants specifically abrogate development of imaginal discs while generally sparing other endoreplicated and post-mitotic larval tissues (Gatti and Baker 1989). Altogether, these analyses highlight how mutations in seemingly “general” cellular regulators can reveal tissue-specific requirements. Moreover, they suggest that several fundamental regulatory pathways are preferentially required in highly mitotic tissues. Whether this simply indicates that diverse processes mutate to a common terminal zygotic phenotype, reflecting the distinct biology of mitotic and nonproliferating cells, or whether there are actually mechanistic links between t6A, SUMO, and the cell cycle, remains to be dissected in the future. The region uncovered byDf(3L)ED220was subjected to a lethal F2 screen after EMS mutagenesis. In total, we conducted nine rounds of mutagenesis using isogenizedw[1118]males (rounds 1 and 2) orw ; FRT80Bmales (subsequent rounds). The animals were desiccated and fed 25mM EMS in 20% sucrose, then mated withw; TM3 Sb/TM6Bfemales. Individual F1TM6Bmales were crossed tow; Df(3L)ED220 w+/TM6Bfemales (Bloomington #8077). Vials were scored for lethality by the absence of empty non-Tb pupal cases. Owing to thew+ marker integral toDf(3L)ED220, stocks of new lethal alleles were recovered by collecting white-eyed flies carrying TM6B, and re-balancing. In total, we conducted nine rounds of mutagenesis, and scored >7000 viable crosses to the deficiency, yielding 64 lethals. Construction ofCG4933rescue transgenes We amplified the genomic region encompassingCG4933and part of the upstream flanking gene using the primers below. The fragment was cloned into pGEM-T-easy and sequence verified. The fragment was then excised with NotI and cloned into NotI digested attB-P[acman] (Venken et al. 2006), which had been treated with calf intestinal phosphatase. 4925AR TAAGCAATTATTTGATAGTCAATCTTTCG CG4933R AAGGAACAGGCCCTTTAAGTGGG We generated GFP-taggedCG4933genomic transgene using recombineering, utilizing a two-step positive/negative selection (Warming et al. 2005). We performed positive/negative galK selection mediated by growth on MacConkey agar (positive selection for integration of the galK cassette) and growth on media containing 2-deoxygalactose (negative selection for replacement of galK cassette with GFP[S65T] CDS). Sequences (galK cassette and GFP[S65T] CDS) were amplified with primers described below from pgalK and pBD1010 (Barry Dickson), respectively. Purified PCR products were electroporated into SW102 bacteria (Warming et al. 2005) with the appropriate attB p[acman] CG4933 vector and selection was carried out as described previously (Venken et al. 2006).

Antibodies used were mouse anti-Cut (DSHB, 1:50), rat anti-Elav (DSHB, 1:500), Alexa Fluor-568 phalloidin (Life Technologies, 1:1000). Appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa 488, 568, and 647 were then used. Tissues were mounted in VECTASHIELD Antifade Mounting Medium with DAPI. We analyzedhsFlp; [w+, arm-lacZ] FRT80B/[w+, ubi-GFP] FRT80BandhsFlp; kae1[1A13] FRT80B/[w+, ubi-GFP] FRT80Banimals. Larvae were heat-shocked at 37°C for 40 min at 72 h after egg laying, and were dissected 3 d after heat shock. Total RNA from homozygous or hemizygous larvae were extracted with TRIzol (Invitrogen), followed by DNase treatment using TURBO DNA-free Kit (Ambion). cDNA were synthesized using SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System with random primers (Invitrogen). QPCR reaction was performed with CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad). Primers used were Kae1_RT_F, TTTGGGTATTGAAGGCAGTG, and Kae1_RT_R, CAGGAAACCTTCTCCTGGTG, and RPL32_RT_F, CCGCTTCAAGGGACAGTATC, and RPL32_RT_R, ACGTTGTGCACCAGGAACTT. Two micrograms of tRNA extracted with mirVana miRNA isolation kit (Ambion) was mixed with 1 pmol of [γ-32P]-labeled primer in 5 μL 1× First-strand buffer (Invitrogen), heated to 95°C and then slowly cooled down to 37°C. Annealed RNA/primer was collected by brief centrifugation, added with 5 μL retro-transcription reaction mix, including 0.5 mM dNTPs, 0.01 M DTT, 200 units SuperScript III (Invitrogen) in 1× First-strand buffer and incubated at 50°C for 50 min, followed by heat inactivation at 70°C for 15 min. Reaction samples were then electrophoresed with 15% polyacrylamide–urea sequencing gels (40 cm long).

The following derivatives of W303 were used: EJP51KAE1/kae1::kanMX6, RS2586BUD32/bud32::kanMX6, and YYF1 SUA5/sua5::kanMX6. PCR was used to amplify theDrosophilacDNAs forKAE1,BUD32,PCC1, andSUA5open reading frames.The cDNAs were cloned into a yeast expression plasmid vector, pADH416 or pADH415, with selectable markersURA3orLEU2, respectively. These plasmids express theDrosophilaproteins from theADHpromoter on a single copy plasmid. As controls, the corresponding yeast genes were expressed under their own promoters in the single copy vector pRS316. The plasmid expressing yeast Kae1 was described previously (Srinivasan et al. 2011) and yeast Pcc1, Bud32, and Sua5 expressing plasmids are pXZ1, pXZ2, and pXZ3, respectively. Mass spectrometric analysis of tRNA modifications All chemicals and reagents used were obtained at the highest purity available and were used without further purification unless stated. Benzonase, bacterial alkaline phosphatase, butylated hydroxytoluene, acetonitrile, and buffer salts were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Coformycin was obtained from the National Cancer Institute. Phosphodiesterase I was purchased from Worthington. Tetrahydrouridine was purchased from Calbiochem. Water purified through a Milli-Q system (Millipore) was used throughout our studies. Sartorius Vivaspin 500-brand centrifugal filter units were used for dialysis and sample concentration. Extraction and purification ofDrosophilaand yeast RNA Total RNAs were isolated using TRIzol and then subjected to a two-step purification to obtain tRNA. First, a PureLink RNA Mini extraction kit (Life Technologies) was used to precipitate the ribosomal RNA in the sample. In the second step, size-exclusion chromatography (SEC-HPLC) was performed using an Agilent Bio SEC-3 column with 10 mM ammonium acetate at pH 7 as the mobile phase. Neutral pH was selected to minimize hydrolysis of ct6A. tRNA and rRNA were collected as separate fractions, vacuum concentrated and reconstituted in water. tRNA concentrations were determined by UV spectroscopy at 260 nm. In the yeast samples, the proportion of tRNA to ribosomal RNA was much higher so only SEC-HPLC fractionation was required to obtain pure tRNA for analysis. Four micrograms of purified tRNA from each sample was digested using a mixture of Benzonase (21.5 U), bacterial alkaline phosphatase (0.5 U) and phosphodiesterase I (0.21 U) in a final reaction volume of 100 µL. Enzymes were dialyzed into 10 mM ammonium acetate at pH 7 immediately prior to use by washing twice with 10 kDa MWCO Vivaspin 500 spin filters. The reaction mixture was supplemented with MgCl2, CaCl2, and ZnCl2, each at a concentration of 0.1 mM. Nucleobase deaminase inhibitors coformycin and tetrahydrouridine were added at a concentration of 10 µg/mL and 50 µg/mL, respectively, and butylated hydroxytoluene (an antioxidant) was added at a concentration of 0.5 mM. The digestion was allowed to proceed for 2 h at 37°C and was stopped upon removal of the enzymes by microfiltration with 10 kDa spin filters. LC-MS/MS analysis of RNA nucleosides Ribonucleosides were separated using a Synergy Fusion RP, 2.5 µm particle size, 100 Å pore size, 100 mm length, 2 mm inner diameter from Phenomenex, on an Agilent 1290 series HPLC system equipped with a diode array detector. Mobile phase A was 5 mM ammonium acetate and mobile phase B was pure acetonitrile. Gradient elution started with 100% A for 1 min, increased to 10% B after 10 min, 40% after 14 min, 80% after 20 min and regeneration of starting conditions with 100% A for 5 additional minutes. The flow rate was 0.35 mL/min and the column temperature 35°C. The effluent from the column was directed through the DAD before entering the Agilent 6430 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer in dynamic multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. The MS was operated in positive ion mode with the following parameters: electro-spray ionization (ESI-MS), fragmentor voltage (average) 80 V, cell accelerator voltage 2 V, N2-gas temperature 350°C, N2-gas flow 10 L/min, nebulizer 40 psi, capillary 3500 V. Modified nucleosides were identified based on having both the correct retention time and mass transition. Under our chromatography conditions, t6A eluted at 8.6 min while ct6A eluted at 6.8 min. Mass transitions werem/z413 → 281 for t6A andm/z395 → 263 for ct6A, both corresponding to the neutral loss of ribose.15N-2-Deoxyadenosine was added to each sample as an internal standard. In each sample, the UV peak areas at 260 nm of the four canonical ribonucleosides—cytidine, uridine, guanosine, and adenosine—were integrated and summed together. Peaks corresponding to detection of MRM transitions for the modified nucleosides were first normalized to the peak area of the internal standard (15N-2-deoxyadenosine) to account for inter-sample detection fluctuations, followed by a second normalization to the summed peak areas of the canonical nucleosides to account for the amount of injected RNA. The adjusted peak areas of the five samples were calculated as a percentage of the corresponding wild-type control sample. Supplemental material is available for this article.
