Davies, Email:jmd32@cam.ac.uk Extracellular purine nucleotides appear capable of regulating plant development, defence and stress responses by acting in part as agonists of plasma membrane calcium channels. Factors stimulating ATP release include wounding, osmotic stress and elicitors. Here we show that exogenous abscisic acid and L-glutamate can also cause ATP accumulation aroundArabidopsis thalianaroots. Release of ADP from root epidermis would trigger ionotropic receptor-like activity in the plasma membrane, resulting in transient elevation of cytosolic free calcium. Root epidermal protoplasts (expressing aequorin as a cytosolic free calcium reporter) can support an extracellular ADP-induced cytosolic calcium elevation in the presence of an extracellular reductant. This confirms that ADP could elicit calcium-based responses distinct to those of ATP, which have been shown previously to involve production of extracellular reactive oxygen species. Extracellular purine nucleotides can regulate plant cell growth, stress responses, immunity and symbiotic events.1,2Their activity at the plasma membrane elicits increased production of nitric oxide (NO), activation of NADPH oxidases to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), and transient elevations of cytosolic free calcium ([Ca2+]cyt).3-9Although there are no equivalents to animal ionotropic or metabotropic purinoreceptor genes apparent in higher plant genomes, plant responses to extracellular purine nucleotides are sensitive to antagonists of animal purinoceptors.1,10-12Arabidopsis thalianaplasma membrane Ca2+channel activity was recently found to be activated rapidly by extracellular ADP, consistent with the presence of an ionotropic receptor.13Parallels with animal cells also extend to a conserved mechanism of ATP and ADP hydrolysis by extracellular apyrase,14plus release of ATP by exocytosis15and an ABC transporter.16 ATP is released at plant wound and growth points, in response to touch, elicitors and hyperosmotic stress imposed by salts.1,17,18Here, wounding, hyperosmotic or sodicity stress resulted in distinct levels and time courses of ATP accumulation around excised roots ofA. thaliana(Fig. 1). Recovery of ATP levels to control values was evident at the 30 min time point after wounding but remained significantly elevated in response to abiotic stresses (30 min time point; NaCl, p < 0.001; sorbitol, p < 0.036, Student’s t-test). The stress response hormone abscisic acid (ABA) at 1 and 10 μM also promoted ATP accumulation around excised roots (Fig. 2A), albeit to a lower level. Accumulation above the ethanol control was significant for both concentrations at 10 and 15 min. Application of 10 μM ABA inhibitsA. thalianaprimary root growth, a response involving a plasma membrane NADPH oxidase and plasma membrane proline-rich extensin-like receptor kinase (PERK4).19,20PERK4 directs the activation of plasma membrane Ca2+influx channels.20As extracellular ATP activates root epidermal plasma membrane Ca2+influx channels via activation of an NADPH oxidase, it becomes feasible that ABA inhibition involves ATP release and sensing upstream of NADPH oxidases and PERKs, resulting in an inhibitory Ca2+influx. High [Ca2+]cytcan act as a “brake” to root hair elongation and perhaps this may also hold for elongation of primary roots.21Production of ROS by NADPH oxidases also promotes root cell elongation by activating plasma membrane Ca2+channels.22Thus, the dose-dependent stimulation or inhibition of growth by extracellular ATP may be effected by the levels of ROS production and channel activation. Extracellular glutamate can also elevate root [Ca2+]cytby activating plasma membrane glutamate receptor-like (GLR) channels.23,24As shown inFigure 2B, 1 μM L-glutamate caused transient ATP accumulation but equimolar D-glutamate did not, indicating stereospecificity of the response. Exposure to 10 μM L-glutamate was less effective than 1 μM, suggesting a biphasic response. At these concentrations, glutamate is unlikely to be transported into roots by the low affinity amino acid permease AAP1 or by H+-coupled symport25,26and so should be acting extracellularly. L-glutamate at 10 μM and above inhibitsA. thalianaprimary root growth,27and it will be interesting to see how this relates, if at all, to ATP functions. Perception of extracellular glutamate at the epidermis upstream of ATP release could be mediated by GLR2.1, 3.3, 3.5 and 5 as the most highly expressed of the gene family in this cell file. Across the meristematic region GLR2.4, 3.3, 3.6,5 are the most highly expressed while across the elongation zone, GLR 1.4, 2.1, 3.3, 3.5 and 3.6 predominate.28 Once purine nucleotides are released from roots, they can activate plasma membrane Ca2+-permeable channels directly (ADP)13or via production of extracellular ROS (ATP).11Accordingly, ATP activation of root epidermal plasma membrane Ca2+-permeable channels can be prevented by applying dithiothreitol (DTT) as a reductant.11Here, ADP-induced [Ca2+]cytelevation ofA. thalianaroot epidermal protoplasts (measured as in ref.13) was unaffected by incubation in DTT (1 mM) (0.1 mM ADP; 0.45 ± 0.04 μM [Ca2+]cyt, n = 6: ADP + DTT; 0.52 ± 0.03 μM [Ca2+]cyt, n = 9), confirming that extracellular ROS are not involved in ADP activation of Ca2+influx.
