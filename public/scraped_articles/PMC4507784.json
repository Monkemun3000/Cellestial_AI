E-mail:soohwan@yonsei.ac.kr Brassinosteroids (BRs) lead to ectopic activation of quiescent centre division as well as modulation of the columella stem cells differentiation inArabidopsisroots in a BR concentration- and BZR1-/BES1-dependent manner. Key words:Auxin, brassinosteroid, BZR1, columella stem cell, PINs, quiescent centre (QC), root apical meristem, root development. Previous publications have shown that BRI1 EMS suppressor 1 (BES1), a positive regulator of the brassinosteroid (BR) signalling pathway, enhances cell divisions in the quiescent centre (QC) and stimulates columella stem cell differentiation. Here, it is demonstrated that BZR1, a BES1 homologue, also promotes cell divisions in the QC, but it suppresses columella stem cell differentiation, opposite to the action of BES1. In addition, BR and its BZR1-mediated signalling pathway are shown to alter the expression/subcellular distribution of pin-formed (PINs), which may result in changes in auxin movement. BR promotes intense nuclear accumulation of BZR1 in the root tip area, and the binding of BZR1 to the promoters of several root development-regulating genes, modulating their expression in the root stem cell niche area. These BZR1-mediated signalling cascades may account for both the ectopic activation of QC cell divisions as well as the suppression of the columella stem cell differentiation. They could also inhibit auxin-dependent distal stem cell differentiation by antagonizing the auxin/WOX5-dependent pathway. In conclusion, BZR1-/BES1-mediated BR signalling pathways show differential effects on the maintenance of root apical meristem activities: they stimulate ectopic QC division while they show opposite effects on the differentiation of distal columella stem cells in a BR concentration- and BZR1-/BES1-dependent manner. Many hormones and protein factors have been shown to be involved in the specification and maintenance of QC and stem cell identity, and the resulting determination of radial and longitudinal patterning (reviewed inBennett and Scheres, 2010;Bitonti and Chiappetta, 2011;Leeet al., 2013). Among them, auxin is a major cell fate-instructive hormone that is synthesized at the shoot tip and transported down to the QC and CSCs at the root tip to form an auxin maximum (Frimlet al., 2003;Blilouet al., 2005). The auxin maximum specifies the hypophysis and the QC and regulates formation of the root meristem (Sabatiniet al., 1999). The presence of the auxin maximum and the auxin gradient along the root are the result of collective activities and topologies of auxin carrier proteins including the pin-formed (PINs) (Grieneisenet al., 2007). Antagonistic regulation of PIN phosphorylation/dephosphorylation by the pinoid (PID) protein kinase and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), respectively, directs topological patterning of PINs and the subsequent auxin flux (Michniewiczet al., 2007). Brassinosteroids (BRs) are polyhydroxylated steroid hormones that play pivotal roles in a wide range of plant growth and developmental processes (Zhuet al., 2013). Upon binding of a BR to its receptor, brassinosteroid insensitive 1 (BRI1) forms a heterodimeric complex with bri1-associated receptor kinase1/somatic embryogenesis receptor kinase3 (BAK1/SERK3)(Bücherlet al., 2013), and the fully activated BRI1/BAK1 complex then initiates a signalling cascade that activates the positively acting transcription factors brassinazole resistant 1/BRI1 EMS suppressor 2 (BZR1/BES2) and BZR2/BES1 to regulate expression of a wide range of genes and the subsequent plant growth and development (Heet al., 2005;Sunet al., 2010;Yuet al., 2011). BR-induced nuclear localization of BZR1/BES1 is crucial for BR activities (Wanget al., 2002;Yinet al., 2002), and this localization is dependent on the phosphorylation and 14-3-3 modification status of the BZR1/BES1 proteins (Gampalaet al., 2007;Ryuet al., 2007;Ryuet al., 2010). Brassinosteroid-insensitive 2 (BIN2) is a GSK3/Shaggy-like kinase that phosphorylates BZR1/BES1, thus acting as a negative regulator of the BR signal transduction pathway (Li and Nam, 2002;Yanet al., 2009). In contrast, PP2A dephosphorylates BZR1 and abolishes BZR1 binding to the 14-3-3- proteins to activate BR-responsive gene expression and plant growth (Tanget al., 2011). Here it is revealed that BR-induced accumulation of BZR1 in the root tips and down-regulation/re-localization of PIN3, PIN4, and PIN7 proteins may result in changes in auxin distribution and the resulting auxin maximum area. This alteration in the auxin localization domain together with gene expression regulation ofBRAVO,ERF115, and other root-regulating genes may lead to ectopic activation of QC division and suppression of CSC differentiation. It is also demonstrated that BR and the related BZR1-/BES1-mediated signalling pathways have opposite effects on the differentiation of distal CSCs inArabidopsisroots in a BR concentration-dependent and a signalling molecule-dependent manner. Plant materials and growth conditions Wild-typeArabidopsis thaliana(Columbia-0, Col-0), its ethylene biosynthesis mutanteto1-11and BR-related mutants (det2,bri1-116,bzr1-D, andbri1-116/bzr1-D), and wild-typeArabidopsis thaliana(Enkheim-2, En-2) and its mutantbes1-Dplants were used for QC, CSC, and columella cell (CC) phenotype analysis and root-regulating gene expression analysis.pBZR1::BZR1-YFPandp35S::BES1-GFPplants were used for BZR1 subcellular localization study and ChIP-qPCR assays. Promoter-driven reporter seeds were kindly provided by Dr Wang at Carnegie Institution for Science, USA (pBZR1::BZR1-YFP,pBZR1::bzr1-D-CFP, and35S::BES1-GFP); Dr Laux at the University of Freiburg, Germany (pWOX5::GFP); Dr Benfey at Duke University, USA (pSCR::SCR-GFP); Dr Guilfoyle at University of Missouri, Columbia, USA (DR5::GFPandDR5::GUS); Dr Friml at Ghent University, Belgium (pPIN3::PIN3-GFP,pPIN4::PIN4-GFP, andpPIN7::PIN7-GFP); and Dr Scheres at Ultrecht University, The Netherlands (pCo2::YFPH2B, andJ2341). The following plants were generated:bzr1-DxpWOX5::GFP,bzr1-DxpSCR::SCR-GFP,bzr1-DxpCO2::YFPH2B,DR5::GFPxbzr1-D, andDR5::GFPxmx3(pBZR1::bzr1-D-CFP). These reporter seedlings were used to trace expression and behaviour of the fusion proteins under the confocal laser-scanning microscope. Seeds were surface-sterilized by sequential washing with 70% EtOH/0.1% Triton X-100 for 20min, 70% EtOH for 10min, and 95% EtOH for 10min. Seeds were dried on a clean bench and cold-treated in the dark at 4 °C for 72h. These sterilized seeds were then sown on 1/2 MS agar medium containing 0.8% phytoagar (pH 5.7) in the presence or absence of the indicated chemicals. Plants were grown in a growth chamber operating under a cycle of 16h light and 8h dark at 23–25 °C with 70% humidity. All seedlings were grown vertically. Brassinolide (BL) and X-GLUC were purchased from Duchefa (The Netherlands) and MB Cell (USA), respectively. All other chemicals used in this report were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA) unless otherwise indicated. Brassinazole (BRZ), bikinin (BK), and α-(phenyl ethyl-2-one)-IAA (PEO-IAA) were kindly provided by Dr Yoshida (RIKEN, Japan), Dr Beeckman (Ghent University, Belgium), and Dr Hayashi (Okayama University of Science, Japan), respectively. For propidium iodide (PI) staining (reported inFigs 1and5), roots were incubated for 30min in PI (5 μg/ml), rinsed, and mounted in H2O before confocal microscopic observation.

(This figure is available in colour atJXBonline.) Staining and detection of β-glucuronidase (GUS) activity was performed according to the method ofJefferson (1987), with some modifications. In brief, roots were fixed in 90% acetone for 20min and infiltrated with staining buffer [0.1M phosphate (pH 7.0), 10mM EDTA, 2.5mM K4Fe(CN)6·3H20, and 1mg/ml X- GLUC]. The resulting stained root tissues were then fixed and processed as described in mPS-PI staining method. mPS-PI staining was performed according to the method ofTruernitet al.(2008)with some modifications to reveal cell shape, the presence of starch granules, and auxin maximum (described inFigs 2,3and4). In brief, roots were fixed in fixative (50% methanol and 10% acetic acid) and then incubated in 1% periodic acid after rinsing with water. Next, the tissues were treated with modified Pseudo Schiff reagent (100mM sodium metabisulphite and 0.15N HCl, supplemented with freshly added PI to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml). The samples were transferred onto microscope slides and covered with a chloral hydrate solution (4g chloral hydrate, 1ml glycerol, and 2ml water) for 5min to observe fluorescence or reflection signals using the Zeiss Confocal microscope.

(This figure is available in colour atJXBonline.) PI, YFP/GFP, and GUS signals were obtained using a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal laser-scanning microscope equipped with an argon 2 ion laser (488nm) and a He/Ne 1 ion laser (543nm). For observation of PI-stained roots, samples were excited at 543nm to collect the PI signal at 595–615nm or excited at 488nm to detect GFP signal at 493–545nm or YFP signal at 521–560nm. For observation of mPS-PI-stained roots, samples were excited at 488nm and the emission was collected at 520–720nm to detect the PI signal. The stained signal for GUS activity was obtained using the reflection mode of the confocal microscope. In this case, the excitation wavelength was 488nm, and the reflection signal was collected at 485–491nm. Images were compiled and analysed using the LSM 710 ZEN image browser software. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis Both BZR1- and BES1-mediated BR signalling pathways stimulate mitotic reactivation of QC cells WOX5expression in the embryonic cell lineage leads to QC formation and is involved in maintaining the stem cell state in a non-autonomous manner (Haekeret al., 2004;Sarkaret al., 2007). It was demonstrated that the QC markerWOX5was expressed in both divided QC cells while a cortex marker (pCO2::YFPH2B,Heidstraet al., 2004), was unchanged in its expression pattern when these plants were grown on medium containing BL (Fig. 1D). SCARECROW (SCR) is required for specification of QC identity, stem cell homeostasis and asymmetric cell division (Sabatiniet al., 2003;Moubayidinet al., 2013). In this study, the SCR reporter plants grown on medium containing BL reactivated QC cell division as determined by morphologic cell lineage but, unexpectedly, SCR protein accumulated predominantly in the upper QC in most BL-treated cells. To verify the effect of BR on QC division,bzr1-Dwas crossed with different cell-specific marker lines (Fig. 1D). Forbzr1-D×pWOX5::GFP, 50% of the plants showed GFP expression in both the upper and lower cells of the QC whereas the other 50% showed expression only in the upper cell. In mostbzr1-D×pSCR::GFP, the GFP signal was present only in the upper cell of the QC. This lack ofWOX5andSCRexpression in the rootward QC cells may indicate an asymmetric QC division and loss of functional QC identity. BRs apparently exert opposite effects on the differentiation of distal CSCs in a concentration- and BZR1-/BES1-dependent manner First, the cell layer number of QC, CSC, and CC was measured for Col-0 (Fig. 2A) and BR biosynthesis-defectivede-etiolated2(det2;Noguchiet al., 1999) (Fig. 2B) plants grown on media containing various concentrations of BL, ranging from 10−15to 10−9M. To do this, root tips were stained with PI by performing mPS-PI staining to mark cell walls and starch granules. As expected, BL stimulated division of the QC in a concentration-dependent manner in both Col-0 anddet2plants. Less than 10% of Col-0 plants grown on media lacking BL carried two layers of QC, and the proportion of plants with the divided QC was greatly increased after exogenous treatment with BL: 60% and 82% of Col-0 plants grown on medium containing 10−10M and 10−9M, respectively, contained two layers of QC (Fig. 2A,D). In contrast, differentiation of CSC into CC was inhibited by the BL treatment. Most Col-0 plants grown on media lacking BL carried a single layer of CSCs, and only 15% of plants had two layers of CSCs. The proportion of Col plants with two CSC layers was moderately increased (25–30%) by the 10−15M to 10−11M of BL treatment, and it reached to 52% by the 10−10M BL treatment, which implies that BL inhibits CSC differentiation into CC. Consistent with this, treatment of exogenous BL reduced the number of CC layers. For example, Col plants grown without exogenous BL had 57% seedlings with four layers of CCs and 43% with three layers of CCs (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, the proportion of plants with fewer CC layers steadily increased with increasing amount of BL treatment, so that plants grown on medium containing 10−10M BL showed 25% seedlings with four layers of CCs, 68% with three layers of CCs, and 7% with two layers of CCs. These concentration-dependent developmental trends of QC, CSC, and CC layers were clearly reproduced in BL-treateddet2plants (Fig. 2B). Next, to investigate the BRI1/BZR1-dependent regulation of QC division and CSC differentiation, the frequency of QC, CSC, and CC layers in diverse BR-related mutant plants was examined. As previously reported (Gonzalez-Garciaet al., 2011),bes1-Dplants grown in MS media under the present experimental conditions showed enhanced QC reactivation and distal cell differentiation (Fig. 2C,E). Twenty percent of En-2 plants had two layers of QC and the remaining 80% carried a single QC cell layer. In comparison, more than 70% ofbes1-Dplants harboured two-layered QCs. Moreover, the proportion ofbes1-Dplants with no CSC also dramatically increased. It was found that 52% of thebes1-Dplants had single-layered CSCs and the rest had no CSC, while 83% of En-2 plants carried single-layered CSCs and the remaining 17% had two-layered CSCs. In accordance, the frequency of plants with higher CC layers was increased in thebes1-Din that 16% of the plants had five layers, 39% four layers, and 45% three layers. In comparison, En-2 plants showed 3% with five-layered, 27% with four-layered, and the remaining 70% with three-layered CCs. BZR1-mediated BR signalling pathway partly acts on the auxin pathway and shows an antagonistic effect on auxin-stimulated CSC differentiation The auxin signalling pathway that stimulates differentiation of CSCs requires activation of auxin responding factors, ARF10 and ARF16 and subsequent restriction ofWOX5transcription in the QC (Wanget al., 2005;Ding and Friml, 2010). Based on these findings, whether the inhibitory effect of the BZR1-mediated BR signalling pathway involves interaction with auxin activities in the distal area was examined. Ninety percent of Col-0 plants grown on MS media without exogenous BL carried a single-layered CSC and the remaining 10% of plants had two layers of CSCs (Fig. 3A,B). In the same population, 23% of the Col-0 plants had five- or six-layered, 64% had four-layered, and 13% had three-layered CCs. As reported previously (Ding and Friml, 2010), Col-0 seedlings grown on medium supplemented with an auxin (1-naphthaleneacetic acid, NAA) led to a decrease in CSC layers and a resulting increase in CC layers. For example, the frequency of plants with single-layered CSCs in NAA-treated Col-0 seedlings was greatly decreased to 52% from 90% in the untreated Col-0 plants. Moreover, 48% of the NAA-treated plants showed no CSC at all. Accordingly, the frequency of NAA-treated plants with more CC layers increased significantly: 30% of the auxin-treated plants carried six-layered CCs, 35% with five-layered, and the remaining 35% had four-layered CCs. Conversely, treatment of plants with an auxin action inhibitor (PEO-IAA,Yoshimotoet al., 2012) increased plants with more CSC layers and with fewer CC layers compared with those of Col-0 plants. BZR1-mediated BR signalling pathway partly acts upstream of auxin in the regulation of CSC differentiation. (A) Effects of auxin-related chemicals on the differentiation of distal CSCs in Col-0 andbzr1-Dplants. (B) Pictures of representative seedlings used for the cell layer measurement presented in (A). Seedlings were grown for 8 DAG on 1/2 MS agar media in the absence or presence of NAA (10−6M) and PEO-IAA (2×10−5M). The CSC and CC layers were identified as described inFig. 2.n>50 seedlings for each treatment. (This figure is available in colour atJXBonline.) BZR1-mediated BR signalling pathway alters the expression/subcellular distribution of PIN proteins resulting in proximal relocation of the auxin localization domain in roots Auxin is synthesized at the shoot tip and transported down to the QC and columella initials in the root tip where the auxin maximum is formed (Blilouet al., 2005). Disruption of the auxin expression domain leads to defective development of the distal meristem (Frimlet al., 2002). Based on the finding that BR acts antagonistically on auxin action in the regulation of CSC differentiation, whether BR modulates the auxin expression domain (auxin maximum) was examined in the root tip usingDR5::GUSandDR5::GFPplants as auxin-sensing reporters. To do this, roots were stained by performing either a GUS activity assay followed by mPS-PI staining to reveal cell walls and starch granules together with auxin-accumulating cells (Fig. 4A,C), or regular PI staining with live tissues to reveal cell walls (Fig. 4B). Auxin gradually accumulated from the QC to the CCs with the highest concentration at the CSC, CC1, and CC2 areas in most plants grown on MS medium without BL (Fig. 4A). About 35% of seedlings also showed auxin maximum at the root tip cells including the QC. Increasing the concentration of BL in the MS medium to 10−10M shifted this expression domain longitudinally upward so that auxin was heavily concentrated at the QC, CSC, CC1, and the proximal area. For instance, more than 80% of BL (10−10M)-treatedDR5::GUSseedlings showed this pattern of auxin expression. Similarly, theDR5::GFPexpression domain inbzr1-Dplants andmx3transgenic plants ectopically expressing the mutated form ofBZR1(pBZR1::bzr1-D-CFP) moved to the proximal area (Fig. 4B). Consistent with the BL-driven proximal shift of the auxin maximum, BK treatment mimicking the BR-induced positive signalling pathway moved the auxin-accumulating domain to the proximal area, whereas treatment of the GUS reporter plants with BRZ reversed the BR effect on the maximum movement (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, someDR5::GUSplants treated with 10−9M BL resulted in enforced accumulation of auxin in the root tip area including the proximal zone, QC, and CCs (Fig. 4A). This is coincident with the finding that treatment of Col-0 plants with higher concentrations of exogenous BL resulted in opposite effects on CSC differentiation and CC development compared with those induced by lower concentrations of BL (Fig. 2A,D). As expected, the gradual expression ofDR5::GUSand correct establishment of auxin maximum were dramatically abolished in plants grown in medium supplied with NAA, in which auxin was uniformly accumulated in all root tip areas at a high level (Fig. 4C). Supplying BL together with the NAA in the growth medium did not reverse this tendency, thus a high amount of auxin remained through the root tip. Next, the PIN reporter plants were treated with BL, as done for the gene expression analysis, and PIN protein expression and subcellular localization was examined (Fig. 5D–F). Without BL treatment, PIN3-GFP protein ofpPIN3::PIN3-GFPplants in this experimental condition accumulated in the cell membrane of CSC and CC1 to the CC3 with predominant expression in CC1 and CC2 (Fig. 5D,F; upper panel). In contrast when BL was added to the incubation medium at a higher concentration (10−6M) for 3h, the PIN3 expression domain was restricted mainly to CC1 and CC2 and disappeared from CC3. At the same time, the characteristic plasma membrane-localized PIN3 pattern was gradually diminished, and PIN3 appeared in endosome- or vesicle-like internal structures (Fig. 5D) at a frequency of 25% in mock-treated plants, which jumped to 65% in the BL-treated plants (Fig. 5E). Finally, growing PIN3 reporter seedlings on medium supplemented with 10−10M BL for 7 DAG resulted in a significant decrease in the number of PIN3 expression layers and intensity of the PIN3 protein expressed (Fig. 5F). For example, 44.4% of the reporter plants showed PIN3-GFP expression in >3 columella cell layers with high expression level while 27.8 % expressed in 1–2 columella cell layers with low expression intensity. In contrast, BL-treated plants displayed 36.8% of plants with expression in >3 columella cell layers with high or medium expression intensity, and 57.9% of plants showed expression in one columella cell layer with low expression intensity. PIN4-GFP protein showed a nonpolar localization mainly in the membrane of CC1 to CC3 with prominent basal accumulation (Fig. 5F; middle panels). PIN7-GFP protein showed a similar expression pattern with prominent expression in CC2 (Fig. 5F; lower panel). Similar to the BL-treatedPIN3::PIN3-GFPplants, treatment of BL (10−10M) topPIN4::PIN4-GFPandpPIN7::PIN7-GFPplants for 7 DAG resulted in a reduction in expression layers and intensity of reporter proteins. In conclusion, the BR signalling pathway modulates PIN gene expression and protein localization, which may lead to proximal relocation of the auxin maximum in the root tip. BR regulates transcriptional expression of diverse root-controlling genes in a BZR1-dependent manner BRs interact with multiple hormone signalling pathways in the regulation of root growth and development (Leeet al., 2013;Zhuet al., 2013for review). Regarding the interaction with auxin, BRs act synergistically with auxin to promote lateral root development by increasing acropetal auxin transport (Baoet al., 2004), and enhance plant tropic responses by promoting the accumulation of PIN2 from the root tip to the elongation zone (Liet al., 2005). Transcript profiling and ChIP-chip experiments have revealed that BZR1 binds to the promoters of many genes involved in auxin biosynthesis, transport, and signalling (Sunet al., 2010). It has been demonstrated that BRs down-regulate transcriptional expression ofPINsand change subcellular localization of their proteins, and thus may alter the auxin localization domain and subsequent root patterning. Supporting this model for BR-induced down-regulation ofPINgenes in roots and the resulting antagonistic action of BR against auxin-induced CSC differentiation, it was recently proposed that oppositely patterned and antagonistic actions of BR and auxin maintain the stem cell balance and optimal root growth (Chaiwanon and Wang, 2015). Epidermis-driven BR signalling and activity is not associated with changes in the expression level of stele-localizedPINs(PIN1,PIN3, andPIN7) (Hachamet al., 2011), but modulates transcriptional expression ofPIN2andPIN4and their accumulation in the epidermis/cortex and columella in a post-transcriptional manner (Hachamet al., 2012). Thus, similar to the model proposed here, the authors proposed that BR-directed auxin distribution represents at least one mechanism that contributes to BR-mediated root growth. In particular, AtPIN4 mediates the sink-driven auxin gradient and the resulting auxin maximum in the QC and the columella initial, and thus controls signals for the QC to regulate auxin-driven root patterning. Consequently, the loss-of-function mutantAtpin4exhibits a divided QC, increased number of both CSC and CC layers, and increased root cap and swelling (Frimlet al., 2002). Decoding the BR-dependent regulatory network in a cell-type specific manner remains a significant challenge, and any information will be useful in mapping BR interactomes with different pathways and uncovering how distinct tissues are coordinated (Fridman and Savaldi-Goldstein, 2013). Here, it has been shown that the effects of BRs in the regulation of QC and distal meristem activities are both BL dose- and BZR1-/BES1-dependent. Nonetheless, when and how BRs control stem cell maintenance and differentiation in roots remains largely unknown. Therefore, future studies must clearly dissect the connections among the dose-dependent perception of BR signals in a cell or tissue, the downstream signalling molecules, and the subsequent developmental patterning occurring in roots. Traditionally, an ARF-bindingDR5-based auxin-inducible reporter (Ulmasovet al., 1997;Barbezet al., 2013) and an Aux/IAA-based auxin signalling sensor (DII-VENUS;Brunoudet al., 2012) have been widely used to accurately map auxin response and distribution at high spatiotemporal resolution in a single-cell-based tobacco system andin planta. Thus, one useful approach would be to develop BR-specific sensors (reporters) and monitor real-time spatiotemporal changes in BR abundance in a cell or a tissue and perform computational modelling to establish BR distribution circuits during the developmental progress. In addition, the identification of BR-regulated target genes in a specific cell type or at a specific developmental time and clarifying their interactive regulation by other hormones will provide another level of understanding of BR-regulated meristem function in plants.
