Published under thePNAS license. Plant vacuoles are essential organelles and occupy up to 90% of the cell volume. Their roles include regulation of stomata movements, protein storage in seeds, gravity sensing, and ion homeostasis. Vacuole or lysosome fusion in eukaryotes is mediated by two multisubunit complexes, SNARE and homotypic fusion and vacuolar protein sorting (HOPS), but only the SNARE complex is well characterized in plants. Here, we show that, similar to other eukaryotes, HOPS mediates vacuole fusion in plants by interaction with SNAREs and that the HOPS subunit VPS33 and the SNARE protein SYP22 display the sites for interaction between these complexes. In contrast to other eukaryotes, however, plant HOPS recruitment to liposomes is inhibited by phosphoinositides, which appear to define strict rules for regulating fusion and fragmentation of dynamic vacuoles. The plant vacuole is an essential organelle with multiple roles including storage, pH homeostasis, and recycling (1). Vacuole fusion is required for stomata opening, pollen fertility, and embryo viability (2–4). Two types of vacuoles exist in plant cells. Embryos in developing seeds contain multiple protein storage vacuoles (PSVs), which have a neutral pH and accumulate storage proteins such as the 7S and 11S globulins. Cells in most mature tissues, instead, contain one large lytic vacuole, which is acidic, abundant in lytic proteases, and critical for ion homeostasis and cell turgor (5). Transition from PSVs to lytic vacuoles occurs during germination (6) and involves PSV fusion and maturation (7). Vacuoles in root meristematic cells are formed by interconnected tubular structures (8), and membrane fusion is necessary for the establishment of the central lytic vacuole (2). Transient and mobile structures such as transvacuolar strands, sheets, and bulbs contribute to the dynamic nature of plant vacuoles (9–12). In vegetative cells, however, very little vacuole fragmentation occurs and most cells contain a single large vacuole. Two exceptions are the changes in guard cell vacuoles during stomata movements (2,13,14) and in the leaf motor cells of the mimosa tree (Albizia julibrissin) (15). In both cases, vacuole remodeling occurs during dramatic changes in cellular turgor that drive organ movements. The changes in guard cell vacuoles that occur during stomata opening require homotypic membrane fusion mediated by the vacuolar soluble NSF attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complex containing VTI11 (2). Vacuole fusion is not well characterized in plants, but in eukaryotic cells it requires SNAREs, RAB GTPases, membrane lipids, and a tethering complex. SNARE proteins mediate membrane fusion by assembly of a four-helix bundle, ortrans-SNARE complex, from one SNARE located in the incoming vesicle and three SNAREs located in the target membrane. The SNARE complex brings the two membranes together via a zippering mechanism that is thought to result in membrane fusion (16). A SNARE complex for plant prevacuolar compartments (PVCs) and the vacuole is composed of SYP22/VAM3 (Qa-SNARE), VTI11 (Qb-SNARE, called Vti1p in yeast), SYP51 (Qc-SNARE), and VAMP727 (R-SNARE) (17,18). The Qabc complex can also associate with the R-SNAREs VAMP711 or VAMP713 (19,20). A role of these SNAREs in vacuole fusion is evidenced by altered vacuole phenotypes ofvti11, syp22, andsyp22 vamp727double mutants (2,18,21). The homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting (HOPS) tethering complex was recently shown to mediate homotypic vacuole fusion in plants (3). HOPS is important for the fusion of vacuoles in yeast (16,22), and fusion of lysosomes inCaenorhabditis elegans(23) and humans (24). The yeast HOPS complex is the best characterized and is formed by six subunits. Vps39p and Vps41p are HOPS specific, while Vps11p, Vps16p, Vps18p, and Vps33p form the “CORE” and are shared with CORVET, a tethering complex that functions at the early endosome (25,26). HOPS recruitment to yeast vacuole membranes requires phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate [PtdIns(3)P] and PtdIns(4,5)P2, two important regulatory lipids in vacuole fusion (27). Vps33 belongs to the family of Sec1/Munc18 (SM) proteins, which are implicated in assembly and regulation of SNARE complexes. SM proteins have a three-domain architecture, in which domains 1 and 3 form a cleft that accommodates the SNAREs (28). The X-ray structure of a fungal Vps33 bound to a single SNARE, together with in vitro fusion assays, suggests that VPS33 catalyzes SNARE complex assembly through a specific SNARE motif recognition (29). All other HOPS subunits are predicted to form a β-propeller at the N terminus and an α-solenoid at the C terminus (30). The complete HOPS complex has been detected inArabidopsisby mass spectrometry (3), and all subunits are encoded in theArabidopsisgenome as single genes (31).VACUOLELESS1(VCL1), the homolog of yeast Vps16,VPS11,VPS39, andVPS41are required for vacuole biogenesis and pollen development (3,4,32–35). VCL1 interacts with VPS33 and VPS11 and localizes to PVCs and the tonoplast (35). VPS18 and VPS39 were also localized to a subdomain of the tonoplast and to cytosolic organelles (3). The molecular mechanisms for HOPS function and regulation during vacuole fusion in plants are not well characterized. The RAB5 and RAB7 GTPase families have been implicated in regulation of endosomes maturation and membrane fusion at the vacuole (36). RAB5 and RAB7 localize to partially overlapping endosome populations, with only RAB7 detected at the tonoplast (19,37–41). The current model is that the SAND-CCZ complex is a RAB5 effector, exerts GEF function on RAB7, and is necessary for the conversion of RAB5 to RAB7 in PVCs (42–44). Active RAB7 is required for vacuolar localization of HOPS subunits VPS18 and VPS39 (3). Here, we characterized VPS41 and VPS33 using reverse genetics, fluorescently tagged proteins, and biochemical analyses. We show that VPS41 and VPS33 are important for pollen fertility and PSV maturation in embryos, and that VPS41 is required for homotypic vacuole fusion in developing seedlings. We demonstrate that both proteins localize to late endosomes, that only VPS41 is detected in the tonoplast, and that they interact with each other and with the vacuolar SNARE SYP22. The VPS41-GFP localization at the tonoplast, but not that at late endosomes, is Wm sensitive. In vitro lipid–protein binding assays show that while VPS33 and VPS41 bind to phosphoinositides on lipid strips, neither protein binds to PtdIns(3)P or PtdIns(3,5)P2-containing liposomes, even though they do bind to control liposomes. We speculate that specific affinities for membrane lipids together with membrane curvature are key regulatory mechanisms behind vacuole fusion events mediated by HOPS and SNAREs. VPS41 and VPS33 Partially Colocalize with Late Endosomes, but only VPS41 Is Detected at the Tonoplast. Subcellular localization of VPS41-GFP and VPS33-GFP. Genomic fusion constructs of VPS41 (VPS41-GFP) and VPS33 (VPS33-GFP) driven by native promoters were cotransformed with subcellular markers intoArabidopsis, and root cells were imaged by confocal microscopy. (A–I) Colocalization of VPS41-GFP (A,D, andG) with mRFP-SYP22 (B), mCherry-RAB7 (E), or mCherry-RAB5 (H) in root cells of stably transformedArabidopsisseedlings. Corresponding merged images are shown (C,F, andI). Arrowheads indicate sites of marker colocalization at the tonoplast, and arrows point to colocalization in endosomes. (Scale bars: 20 µm.) (J–R) Colocalization of VPS33-GFP (J,M, andP) with mRFP-SYP22 (K), mCherry-RAB7 (N), or mCherry-RAB5 (Q). The merged images are shown (L,O, andR). No apparent accumulation of VPS33-GFP was detected at the tonoplast. Partial colocalization was detected in RAB5 and RAB7 endosomes (arrows). (Scale bars: 20 µm.) (SandT) Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients from the colocalization analyses between VPS41-GFP (S) or VPS33-GFP (T) with mRFP-SYP22, mCherry-RAB5, or mChery-RAB7. Thirty-seven to 56 images from nine seedlings combined were used for each analysis. Bars represent SE. VPS41 Tonoplast Association Is Dependent on Phosphoinositides. Phosphoinositides regulate the membrane association of VPS41. (A) GST-VPS41 and GST-VPS33 bind to phosphoinositide lipids. GST-VPS41 (Center) and GST-VPS33 (Right) were expressed inE. coliand purified by affinity chromatography. Lipid affinity of purified proteins was analyzed using a lipid strip assay. Lipids include the following: LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; LPC, lysophosphocholine; PA, phosphatidic acid; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PS, phosphatidylserine; S1P, sphingosine-1-phosphate. (B) GST-VPS41 and GST-VPS33 bind to liposomes that lack phosphoinositides. Affinity-purified GST-VPS41 and GST-VPS33 proteins were incubated without liposomes (none) or with PC/PE liposomes bearing no phosphoinositides (control), PtdIns(3)P, or PtdIns(3,5)P2, and protein binding was detected by cosedimentation and immunoblot with α-GST. Incubation with PI(3)P-GRIP was used as positive control, and GST alone was used as negative control. (C–H) Wm treatment induces dissociation of VPS41-GFP from the tonoplast, but not from endosomes.Arabidopsisseedlings expressing VPS41-GFP (CandF) and mCherry-RAB7 (DandG) were treated with DMSO (C–E) or 33 µM Wm (F–H) for 3 h and observed by confocal microscopy. Merged images are shown (EandH). Tonoplast localization of VPS41-GFP is indicated with arrowheads. Wm induced the enlargement of RAB7-labeled endosomes (arrows) that retained VPS41-GFP signal. (Scale bar: 20 µm.) (I–N) Wm treatment induces dissociation of VPS41-GFP from the tonoplast.Arabidopsisseedlings expressing VPS41-GFP (IandL) and mRFP-SYP22 (JandM) were treated with DMSO (I–K) or 33 µM Wm (L–N) for 3 h and observed by confocal microscopy. VPS41-GFP signal is depicted using a rainbow LUT (IandL), where high intensity values are represented in red and low intensity values are shown in blue. Red pixels were associated with the tonoplast in the DMSO control only. Merged images are shown using green color for the GFP signal (KandN). (Scale bar: 20 µm.) (O) Quantification of the tonoplast localization of VPS41-GFP fromI–N. The ratio between the membrane and cytosolic fluorescence intensity of VPS41-GFP was calculated using ImageJ from DMSO or Wm-treated seedlings (N= 27 images from seven to eight seedlings per treatment; *significant in attest atP< 0.05). HOPS Is Essential for Male Fertility and Important for Plant Development. HOPS Is Important for Vacuole Biogenesis and Fusion. HOPS is required for protein storage and lytic vacuole morphology. (A–D) Morphology of protein storage vacuoles (PSVs) in mature embryos from the WT control (Col-0) (A),zip2/vps41(B),vps33-1(C), andvps33-2(D). Autofluorescence of the PSVs was acquired by CLSM. (Scale bar: 20 µm.) (E) Vacuole number distribution in mature embryos. Embryos from WT control (Col-0),vps33-1,vps33-2, andzip2/vps41were imaged as inA–D, and the number of vacuoles per cell was counted. Only cells with a cross-section area between 11 and 15.9 µm2were included in the analysis. Bars represent the percentage of cells with less than 4 (blue), 5–6 (orange), 7–8 (gray), 9–10 (red), and 11 or more (green) vacuoles per cell in each genotype. Col-0,n= 165 cells;zip2,n= 146 cells;vps33-1,n= 154 cells;vps33-2,n= 118 cells. (F–N) Vacuole morphology of amiRNA lines after DEX induction. Seedlings from Col-0 WT (control,F–H), amiR-vps41(I–K), and amiR-vps11(L–N) were incubated for 72 h with DEX and stained with BCECF and FM4-64. Roots were imaged at the meristematic zone (MZ), elongation zone (EZ), and differentiation zone (DZ). (Scale bar: 20 µm.) A dexamethasone (DEX)-inducible amiRNA system was used to determine the function of HOPS in developing seedlings. The HOPS-CORE subunit VPS11 and the HOPS-specific subunit VPS41 were targeted by the inducible amiRNA system. WT, amiR-vps41, and amiR-vps11seedlings were treated with DMSO (control) or DEX for 72 h, and vacuole morphology was observed by 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF) staining. Normal vacuole morphology was observed in both amiR-vps11and amiR-vps41in the absence of DEX compared with the WT (SI Appendix, Fig. S3G) and in the WT after DEX treatment (Fig. 3F–H). In contrast, dramatic changes in vacuole morphology were observed after DEX induction of the two lines. Both amiR-vps41(Fig. 3I–K) and amiR-vps11(Fig. 3L–N) seedlings showed highly fragmented vacuoles in meristematic zone (MZ), elongation zone (EZ), and differentiation zone (DZ) of the root after DEX induction. We note that the phenotype was observed only in cells that were not elongated at the time of induction. This phenotype together with the PSV phenotype of allelic mutants demonstrates a critical role of HOPS for vacuole fusion and biogenesis. VPS41 and VPS33 Interact in Vivo with Each Other and with SYP22 in Specific Foci. VSP33 Interacts Directly with the Qa SNARE SYP22. VPS33 mediates SNARE complex assembly in yeast (29), and we could detect interactions between VPS33, VPS41, and SYP22 by BiFC. Therefore, we tested whether either of the two HOPS subunits could support a direct interaction with SYP22 by in vitro coimmunopreciptation. Proteins were expressed as tagged fusions to either GST (VPS33 and VPS41) or HIS (SYP22 and VTI11), and immunoprecipitation was carried out using an α-HIS antibody. GST-VPS41 was not detected in the α-HIS immunoprecipitate when incubated with either HIS-SYP22 or HIS-VTI11 (Fig. 4G), indicating a lack of direct interaction. In contrast, a direct interaction between GST-VPS33 and HIS-SYP22 was detected using this assay, as GST-VPS33 was detected in the immunoprecipitate (Fig. 4G). This interaction was confirmed in a complementary experiment where α-GST pulled down both HIS-SYP22 and GST-VPS33 in the coimmunoprecipitate (SI Appendix, Fig. S4G). Whether or not there were direct interactions with HIS-VTI11 was less definitive. Incubation of GST-VPS33 and HIS-VTI11 with α-HIS produced detectable signals of GST-VPS33 on immunoblots (Fig. 4G), but no signal was detected for HIS-VTI11 when α-GST was used (SI Appendix, Fig. S4G). Overall, these data provide strong evidence that HOPS–SNARE interactions in plants are mediated by direct interaction of VPS33 and SYP22, most likely due to conserved mechanisms. The HOPS Subunit VPS41 Genetically Interacts with the VTI11 SNARE. Phosphoinositides and Membrane Curvature Delimit VPS41 and VPS33 Recruitment. Phosphoinositides recruit HOPS to the vertex ring between two juxtaposed vacuoles undergoing fusion in yeast (27,52). We hypothesized that these lipids could fulfill a similar role in plants, and this was first supported by VPS41 and VPS33 binding to immobilized phosphoinositides on a membrane. Surprisingly, both VPS33 and VPS41 also bound to membrane liposomes but only in the absence of PtdIns(3)P or PtdIns(3,5)P2. This result implicates membrane curvature as an additional factor in the recruitment of HOPS to cellular membranes in plants and highlights the sensitivity of these proteins to both membrane topology and phosphoinositide lipid content. The plant vacuole membrane is a flat surface compared with the late endosomes, and membrane curvature could indeed represent a proxy for organelle identity in plant vacuole traffic. We propose that VPS41 binding to the vacuole membrane entails its recruitment by PtdIns(3)P or PtdIns(3,5)P2, since PtdIns(3)P has been detected at the tonoplast, and both are important for vacuolar traffic (64,65). In contrast, VPS41 binding to curved membranes such as those of late endosomes is independent of and inhibited by phosphoinositides. This model is further supported by the loss of VPS41-GFP from the vacuole membrane but not from late endosomes in Wm-treated cells. The inhibitory effect of phosphoinositides on VPS33 and VPS41 binding to liposomes suggests that plants have evolved different mechanisms of regulating vacuole fusion compared with yeast. In contrast to plants, the complete yeast HOPS complex and VPS41 alone bind to liposomes containing vacuolar phosphoinositides, but they do not bind strongly to bare liposomes (27,66,67). Therefore, while phosphoinositides promote recruitment of HOPS to curved membranes in yeast, they have the opposite effect in plants. Current models for vacuole fusion propose that the site of HOPS function, the vertex of two juxtaposed vacuoles, represents a highly curved membrane (68,69). Moreover, small liposomes may be used as a proxy for HOPS interactions with the membrane at the vertex ring (68). The liposomes used here are not small enough to represent membrane curvature at sites of vacuole fusion, but if phosphoinositides also abolish HOPS binding at these sites, it would be consistent with yet another phenomenon observed only in plants. Our group has shown that Wm induces vacuole fusion in plants, both in developing roots and in guard cells, and we proposed that phosphoinositides function as negative regulators of vacuole fusion (2). This effect of Wm, however, is not observed in yeast vacuoles (48) or animal lysosomes (49), and therefore, plants seemed to have coerced the regulatory role of phosphoinositides into inhibitors rather than promoters of vacuole fusion. This difference may be due to evolutionary changes in the mechanisms by which VPS41 binds to membranes. VPS41 binding to highly curved membranes in yeast is mediated by an amphipathic lipid packing sensor (ALPS) motif, which also contains two important regulatory phosphorylation sites (67). The ALPS motif is not conserved in plants includingArabidopsis(SI Appendix, Fig. S5), which further supports the existence of plant-specific mechanisms for recruitment of HOPS to highly curved membranes. HOPS–SNARE Interactions Are Mediated by the SYP22 Qa SNARE. Plant Materials, Growth Conditions, and Transformation. Arabidopsis thalianaplants were grown as described (2). The ecotype Columbia (Col-0) was used as WT control. The genomic VPS41-GFP fusion (VPS41p::VPS41-GFP) was described elsewhere (4). Organelle markers mRFP-SYP22 (18), mCherry-RAB5 (mCherry-RabF2a), and mCherry-RAB7 (mCherry-RabG3f) (51) have been previously described. SALK T-DNA insertion lines, includingvps41-1(SALK_076372),vps41-2(SALK_035406),vps33-3(SALK_016684C),vps33-4(SALK_151719), andvps33-5(SALK_143407), were obtained from theArabidopsisBiological Resource Center (ABRC) and genotyped by PCR (SI Appendix, Table S4). Thezip2 zig-1mutant was previously characterized (56). The TILLING lines (57)vps33-1(CS92162) andvps33-2(CS93595) were obtained from ABRC and backcrossed three times with Col-0 WT. Homozygousvps33-1andvps33-2were genotyped by PCR amplification (SI Appendix, Table S4) and restriction digestion with BsmBI (vps33-1) or TspRI (vps33-2).Nicotiana benthamianaplants were grown at room temperature for 3–4 wk in Metro-Mix 300 soil with a 16-h light/8-h dark photoperiod. Arabidopsistransformation was carried out by floral dip (81) usingAgrobacterium tumefaciensC58C1 and GV3101. Transient plant Agro-infiltration of 3- to 4-wk-oldN. benthamianaleaves was carried out as described (82). GFP or RFP fluorescence was observed by confocal laser-scanning microscopy (CLSM) 36–48 h after infiltration. The full-length genomic fusion of VPS33 with GFP driven by either 3- or 1-kb native promoters were generated using the GoldenBraid system (83). Primers for VPS33 genomic sequences (SI Appendix, Table S4) were generated by the GB domesticator software (https://gbcloning.upv.es/tools/domestication/), and each part was amplified by PCR (83,84). Each transcriptional unit (TU) was assembled by restriction–ligation reaction into pUPD2 and sequenced. The full fusion construct containing the VPS33 promoter and genomic sequence, GFP, and the VPS33 terminator sequence was then assembled into pDGB3_alpha1. This cassette was finally inserted into pDGB3_omega1 together with the kanamycin resistance cassette from pGB0184 to generate pVPS33::gVPS33-GFP (VPS33-GFP). All experiments were carried out with the 3-kb promoter, except forFig. 1P–R, where the 1-kb promoter was used. UBIQUITIN10 (UBQ10) promoter-driven and BiFC constructs were generated by Gateway cloning. Coding sequences of VPS41 (At1g08190), VPS33 (At3G54860), VTI11 (At5G39510), SYP22 (AT5G146860), and AtTIP2;1 (AT3G16240) were obtained by RT-PCR. Briefly, total mRNA was extracted from Col-0 WT seedlings using TRI reagent (Ambion) and treated with DNase I (New England Biolabs) according to manufacturer’s instruction. cDNAs were synthesized using iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad) and amplified by PCR using gene-specific primers (SI Appendix, Table S4) compatible for Gateway cloning. Entry clones were generated in pENTR4 or pENTR/D-TOPO (Invitrogen) (SI Appendix, Table S3). Expression clones (SI Appendix, Table S2) were generated by recombination between the entry clones and multiple destination vectors using LR clonase II (Invitrogen). Vectors driven by the pUBQ10 promoter were generated after substitution of the short UBQ promoter of the vector set described in ref.85with the full pUBQ10 promoter (1,596 bp) from pNIGEL07 (51). pDEST15 and pDEST17 destination vectors (Invitrogen) were used for protein expression in bacteria, and N- and C-terminal nEYFP and cEYFP pSITE vectors (86) were used to generate constructs for BiFC. All expression constructs are described inSI Appendix, Table S2. The amiR-vpsconstructs were cloned using the GreenGate system (87). Specific amiRNA sequences againstVPS41andVPS11(AT2G05170) were identified with the Web MicroRNA Designer (WMD3) tool (88) atwmd3.weigelworld.org/cgi-bin/webapp.cgi. The amiR-vpssequences were amplified in four independent PCRs (SI Appendix, Table S5) with the pRS300 plasmid containing the miR319a precursor sequence. To be suited for the GreenGate cloning system, primers “A” and “B” were modified with specific overhangs. The final PCR products (fourth reaction) were first digested with Eco31I and then ligated into the preopened intermediate vectors (SI Appendix, Table S5). The resulting vectors (supermodule A and B for each amiR-vps) were sequenced and combined in consecutive GreenGate reactions as described (87). The DEX induction system is based on the p6xOP/LhG4-GR transcription system (89,90). Primers and vectors used in these experiments are reported inSI Appendix, Tables S3–S5. Zeiss LSM 710 or Zeiss LSM880 with Airyscan confocal microscopes were used for all imaging experiments unless specified. The excitation/emission wavelengths for imaging were 488 nm/492–570 nm for GFP and YFP, 561 nm/588–696 nm for mCherry and mRFP, and 561 nm/566–690 nm for LysoTracker Red. Three-day-old seedlings were analyzed with a 40×/1.2 N.A. water-immersion objective. To image PSVs, seeds were imbibed in water for 1 h, and seed coats were peeled off with a sharp needle. Vacuoles in the mature embryos were imaged by capturing PSV autofluorescence (excitation/emission wavelengths were 405/450–510 nm) from a singleZplane per sample. PSV quantification was carried out using Fiji (Fiji Is Just ImageJ, based on ImageJ 1.51d;fiji.sc/) (91). Linear (Pearson) and the nonlinear (Spearman’s) correlation coefficients for colocalization analysis were obtained with the PSC colocalization plug-in (92). The threshold level for the noise was set at 4. Membrane/cytosolic ratios of VPS41-GFP were calculated in Fiji by extracting intensity values of VPS41-GFP only from the vacuole membrane. This was accomplished by generating a membrane signal mask by thresholding of the RFP-SYP22 marker in the red channel to 40 or above. The mask was then applied to the GFP channel to extract the histograms of intensity values for VPS41-GFP at the membrane. A “cytosolic” intensity average was calculated by measuring intensity values from four cytosolic regions of interest per image. Chemical Treatments and Fluorescent Dyes. Three- or 4-d-old seedlings were used in all chemical treatments and fluorescent dye stainings. Wm (W3144; Sigma) was diluted in liquid AGM to a final concentration of 33 μM, and the same volume of DMSO was added to the control (1% final). Seedlings were treated for 3 h in the dark at 22 °C. A minimum of three seedlings was analyzed for each treatment, and the experiment was repeated three times. LysoTracker Red staining was carried out by incubation of seedlings in liquid AGM supplemented with 2 μM LysoTracker Red (Invitrogen) for 2 h. For amiRNA induction with DEX, 5 d-old seedlings were incubated for 72 h in liquid AGM supplemented with 30 µM DEX, or DMSO (control). Seedlings were stained with 10 µM BCECF, acetoxymethyl ester, and 1 µM FM 4-64 as described (8). BL21-AIE. colicells (Invitrogen) were transformed with T7::GST-VPS41, T7::GST-VPS33, T7::GST, T7::HIS-SYP22, or T7::HIS-VTI11. Recombinant bacteria were cultured in 300 mL of LB broth supplemented with 50 μg/mL carbenicillin and 1% glucose at 37 °C to an OD of 0.4–0.6. Expression of the tagged proteins was induced with 0.2% arabinose. Cultures were incubated at 28 °C for 5 h, except for T7::HIS-SYP22, which was incubated at 37 °C for 4 h, and HIS-VTI11, which was incubated at 16 °C for 24 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 16,000 ×gfor 15 min and the pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris⋅HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 1% Triton X-100, 1× protease inhibitors; Roche; #04693132001) and 12 μg/mL lysozyme (Sigma). The extract was cleared by centrifugation at 11,200 ×gfor 20 min, and the supernatant was then added to either a Gluthatione Sepharose 4B resin (GE Healthcare) or a Ni Sepharose 6 Fast Flow resin (GE Healthcare), accordingly. The recombinant proteins were eluted after an overnight incubation at 4 °C in slow rotation following the manufacturer’s recommendations. In Vitro Protein–Protein Interaction. Mouse anti-GST (catalog #MA4-004; Thermo Fisher Scientific) or mouse Penta-HIS (Qiagen 34660) antibodies were bound to Dynabeads Protein G (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. To avoid coelution of the antibodies, we treated the beads with BS3(Thermo Scientific) cross-linking agent. Beads and antibodies were incubated for 30 min at room temperature, treated with 1 M Tris⋅HCl, pH 7.5, quenching buffer, and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. After three washes, the different protein combinations were added. Samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C with rotation. Beads were washed three times with PBS buffer containing protease inhibitors, and bound proteins were eluted by 5-min denaturation at 90 °C in Laemmli buffer. Proteins were resolved in 10% acrylamide gels or 3–8% Tris-acetate protein gels (Invitrogen). We thank J. Fernandez, J. Gillikin and D. Selote for technical assistance, and J. Lohmann and J.
