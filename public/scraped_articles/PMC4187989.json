  "content": "Sigma S-Dependent Antioxidant Defense Protects Stationary-PhaseEscherichia coliagainst the Bactericidal Antibiotic Gentamicin Address correspondence to A. C. Matin,a.matin@stanford.edu. Present address: Michael Benoit, Lathrop & Gage LLP, Boulder, Colorado, USA. Received 2014 Jun 17; Revision requested 2014 Jul 14; Accepted 2014 Jul 19. Stationary-phase bacteria are important in disease. The σs-regulated general stress response helps them become resistant to disinfectants, but the role of σsin bacterial antibiotic resistance has not been elucidated. Loss of σsrendered stationary-phaseEscherichia colimore sensitive to the bactericidal antibiotic gentamicin (Gm), and proteomic analysis suggested involvement of a weakened antioxidant defense. Use of the psfiAgenetic reporter, 3′-(p-hydroxyphenyl) fluorescein (HPF) dye, and Amplex Red showed that Gm generated more reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the mutant. HPF measurements can be distorted by cell elongation, but Gm did not affect stationary-phase cell dimensions. Coadministration of the antioxidantN-acetyl cysteine (NAC) decreased drug lethality particularly in the mutant, as did Gm treatment under anaerobic conditions that prevent ROS formation. Greater oxidative stress, due to insufficient quenching of endogenous ROS and/or respiration-linked electron leakage, therefore contributed to the greater sensitivity of the mutant; infection by a uropathogenic strain in mice showed this to be the case alsoin vivo. Disruption of antioxidant defense by eliminating the quencher proteins, SodA/SodB and KatE/SodA, or the pentose phosphate pathway proteins, Zwf/Gnd and TalA, which provide NADPH for ROS decomposition, also generated greater oxidative stress and killing by Gm. Thus, besides its established mode of action, Gm also kills stationary-phase bacteria by generating oxidative stress, and targeting the antioxidant defense ofE. colican enhance its efficacy. Relevant aspects of the current controversy on the role of ROS in killing by bactericidal drugs of exponential-phase bacteria, which represent a different physiological state, are discussed. Stationary-phase bacteria play critical roles in disease causation (1–4). Due to a dearth of nutrients and/or other factors, bacteria in the host often experience this late growth phase (5–8), and it is in this phase that many of their virulence traits are primarily expressed (9–11). For example, in pathogenic strains ofEscherichia coli, thecsgBAgenes, encoding curli which mediate host invasion (12), and thefimgenes, encoding type I fimbriae which are involved in bladder colonization, are expressed in stationary phase (13,14). Stationary-phase bacteria become highly resistant to disinfectants, are difficult to eradicate, and play a key role in the heightened resistance of bacterial biofilms (15,16); it is therefore important to explore means for their control (17,18). The bacterial general stress response (GSR), regulated by σS(product of therpoSgene), is activated in the stationary phase ofE. colibacteria (7,8,19) and is responsible for their high degree of resistance, which is due to the expression of a core set of proteins that protect vital cell biomolecules, i.e., proteins, DNA, and the cell envelope (7,8,20). Since bactericidal antibiotics exert their toxic effects in bacteria by damaging these molecules, we along with others postulated that σSis likely to have a role in protecting bacteria against these drugs as well, and it has been shown that constitutive expression ofrpoScan minimize antibiotic sensitivity in a multidrug-resistant strain ofE. coliand that anrpoSmutant ofPseudomonas aeruginosabecomes more sensitive to carbapenems in stationary phase (8,21). However, the mechanistic basis of this role has as yet remained unexplored. We have discovered that in stationary-phaseE. coli, the loss of σSdoes indeed result in rendering the bacterium markedly more sensitive to three bactericidal antibiotics that target different macromolecules: gentamicin ([Gm] ribosomes), ampicillin (peptidoglycan), and ciprofloxacin (DNA). Here, we present in-depth analysis of the biochemical basis that renders the ΔrpoSmutant sensitive to Gm; a future report will deal with the other two antibiotics. We show that the efficacy of Gm in killing stationary-phaseE. coliis enhanced by the absence of not only σSbut also of several σS-dependent proteins of antioxidant defense, that this loss leads to higher levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress upon Gm treatment, and that the antioxidant defense contributes to Gm resistance ofE. colialsoin vivo. In identifying new targets for enhancing the effectiveness of a widely used antibiotic, we address the worldwide public health threat posed by the increasing bacterial antibiotic resistance (22,23). σshas been implicated in resistance of stationary-phaseE. colito bacteriostatic drugs by Kolodkin-Gal and Engelberg-Kulka but only in strains also missing the MazEF toxin-antitoxin system (24), which is not the case with the mechanism reported here. The MazF toxin was implicated as being responsible for the killing, but whether this toxin actually kills bacteria is controversial (25). Regardless, their studies dealt with a different class of antibiotics. There is currently a strong controversy concerning the role of oxidative stress in the toxicity of bactericidal drugs in exponential-phaseE. coli(26–29). The stationary-phase bacteria differ from their exponential-phase counterparts not only as regards the σs-mediated changes noted above but also in other respects (30–32). Thus, as stationary-phase bacteria represent a physiological state very different from exponential-phase cells, this controversy is not germane to this study and is noted only in relevant contexts. Bacterial strains and experimental design. TheE. coliK-12 BW25113 strain and several of its isogenic gene knockout mutants from the Keio collection (33) were used, as well as our clinical isolate of uropathogenicE. coli(UPEC strain AMG1) (34); its isogenic ΔrpoSmutant and double mutants of the Keio strain were generated as described previously (35). The knockouts were confirmed by PCR. To construct strains bearing a single copy of ansfiA-lacZfusion to monitor oxidative stress intracellularly, bacteria were transfected with thesfiA-lacZfusion cassette from theE. coliSY2 strain by P1vir(Coli Genetic Stock Center [CGSC], Yale University) transduction according to established protocols (36). Activation of thesfiApromoter (psfiA) was measured using a chlorophenol red-β-d-galactopyranoside (CPRG) β-galactosidase assay kit (G-Biosciences, St. Louis, MO) according to the manufacturer's protocol with modifications in the cell lysis procedure for bacteria (37). β-Galactosidase activity was normalized to the CFU/ml value. Bacteria were grown overnight to late stationary phase at 37°C in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth with shaking (200 rpm); the following morning, they were diluted to anA600of 0.45 (1.3 × 109cells/ml) in M9 minimal medium without glucose (34,35) (referred to as M9 salts). Gm was added at 16 μg/ml; parallel controls were run without the drug. This drug concentration was chosen because in the experimental period, it had minimal effect on the viability of the wild type and clearly revealed the effect of various mutations on drug sensitivity. Gm at 16 μg/ml represents the MIC for resistant (R) Gram-negative bacteria. (Gm MICs for intermediate [I] and sensitive [S] strains are 8 and 4 μg/ml, respectively.) MIC values are determined for growing bacteria and represent concentrations that inhibit growth; in contrast, our work concerns stationary-phase bacteria, which are well known to be more resistant, and deals with bactericidal effects, which occur at higher concentrations than the MIC values (38). The suspensions were incubated aerobically at 37°C for 24 h without shaking (unless otherwise indicated). Samples were drawn at specified times (as indicated in the text and in Table S1 in the supplemental material), serially diluted in M9 salts, and cultured on LB agar to determine CFU counts. For determining drug sensitivity under anoxic conditions, cell suspensions were incubated anaerobically in a GasPak EZ gas kit (Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD). In vivostudies in mice, conducted according to Stanford University protocols, were done as described previously (39). Seven-week-old CBA/J mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) were acclimated to our animal facility for 1 week prior to the experiments. Transurethral inoculation of 107CFU/50 μl/mouse was performed using wild-type UPEC AMG1 or its isogenic ΔrpoSmutant. LB-grown cultures of the two strains were diluted to 107CFU/50 μl using phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Mice were anesthetized with inhaled isoflurane, and their perinea were cleaned with 70% ethanol. To ensure that mouse bladders did not overflow during transurethral inoculation and to reduce urine output, the animals were deprived of water for 30 min prior to anesthesia administration and encouraged to void by scruffing and gentle pressure on the lower abdomen. Using PE10 polyethylene tubing-covered 30-gauge needles (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), the mice were transurethrally catheterized, and the inoculum was injected over 5 s. Immediately thereafter, mice were administered PBS alone or PBS with 50, 5, or 0.5 μg of Gm by subcutaneous injection, followed by four more doses every 2 h (total of five doses). Two days after infection, the animals were sacrificed by a combination of isoflurane overdose and cervical dislocation. Mouse bladders were removed aseptically and homogenized using sterile 1.6-mm stainless steel beads and a Bullet Blender homogenizer (Next Advance, Averill Park, NY). Suitably diluted samples of the bladder homogenate were used in CFU determinations on MacConkey agar. Effect of gentamicin treatment onrpoS-regulated proteins in stationary-phaseE. coli Plus and minus signs indicate up- and downregulation, respectively, of the first strain named in each comparison relative to the second strain. Thus, for the comparison of the ΔrpoSmutant versus the wild type, a negative number means that the concentration of the protein was lower in the mutant by the fold indicated. Where indicated, Gm was added at 16 μg/ml (+ Gm). Boldface indicates proteins that were upregulated in the wild type by Gm treatment compared to the mutant. Underlining indicates proteins that were downregulated in the mutant compared to the wild type upon Gm treatment. w/o, without. To measure H2O2, an Amplex Red hydrogen peroxide assay kit (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cell suspensions in the presence of Amplex Red reagents with or without Gm were loaded onto a black 96-well plate as described above. The samples were incubated at 37°C in a light shield enclosure. Fluorescence (excitation, 560; emission, 590 nm) of the suspension was measured at 2, 4, and 6 h. Visualization of cell dimensions. Antibiotic-treated and untreated cell suspensions were pelleted by centrifugation, washed in PBS, and resuspended in 1/10 volume of ice-cold PBS. Five microliters of the samples was spotted on glass slides and allowed to air dry in a flow hood, followed by an overlay of the mounting medium (SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, AL). A glass coverslip was placed on the samples, and its edges were sealed with nail polish. Differential interference contrast (DIC) images were visualized in a Zeiss AxioImager DIC microscope (Stanford Neuroscience Microscopy Service) at magnification settings of ×63, ×1.6, and ×10 (objective, Optovar, and eyepiece, respectively) and captured by an AxioCam HRm Rev 3 camera. NADP/NADPH ratio determination. NADP and NADPH levels were measured using a Fluoro NADP/NADPH Detection Kit (Cell Technology, Inc., Mountain View, CA). The cultures were prepared as described for antibiotic treatment. After incubation with gentamicin, NADP and NADPH were extracted according to the manufacturer's instructions; cells not treated with the drug were used as controls. A nonfluorescent reagent becomes reduced in the presence of NADPH to form NADP and a fluorescent analog. NADP is converted back to NADPH via an enzyme-coupled reaction, and the reaction proceeds back to the first step. Fluorescence was measured using a SpectraMax fluorescence plate reader (550-nm excitation; 595-nm emission). The protein concentration of each sample was determined after the fluorescence measurement for normalization. Protein carbonylation was done as described before (40). Cells were pelleted by centrifugation, the pellets were suspended in lysis buffer (150 μl; 200 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 1% SDS), vortexed, and boiled (5 min); protein concentrations were determined using a Bio-Rad detergent-compatible (DC) protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and adjusted to 100 μg/ml. Samples were derivatized by the addition of 1 volume of 12% SDS, followed by 2 volumes of 20 mM 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine, mixed, and incubated at room temperature (30 min). Derivatization was stopped by the addition of 1.5 volumes of 2 M Tris in 30% glycerol. Samples were loaded onto a slot blot apparatus (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and vacuum transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane according to the manufacturer's protocol. The membrane was blocked using 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, plus 0.5% Tween 20 (TBST) at 4°C overnight, followed by incubation (1 h) with rabbit anti-dinitrophenol antibody (1:500; Abcam, Cambridge, MA). The membrane was washed with TBST and incubated with mouse anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (at 1:2,000 for 1 h) (Cell Signaling Technologies, Danvers, MA). Bands were visualized using Kodak BioMax chemiluminescent film (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) after incubation of the membrane with an ECL kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL). Band intensity on the exposed film was quantified by ImageJ software (NIH). Membrane fractions of cell extracts were prepared as described previously (41). Cells were grown overnight as described above and harvested by centrifugation (4,200 ×gfor 30 min at 4°C). The cell pellet was washed with ice-cold 6 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), resuspended in buffer of the same composition to anA600of 75, and broken in a French press (20,000 lb/in2). Cell debris was removed by a low spin (11,000 ×gfor 50 min at 4°C). The supernatant was ultracentrifuged (165,000 ×gfor 1 h at 4°C) to pellet the membrane fraction, which was suspended in potassium phosphate buffer (6 mM, pH 7.0), and protein concentration was determined (Bradford method). The reaction mixture for alamarBlue (AB) reduction (250 μl) contained 100 μg of the membrane fraction protein, 10% AB, 0.1 μmol of NADH, 6 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), and rotenone (1 μM; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) with or without Gm. The mixtures were incubated at 37°C in the dark for 20 min, followed by measurement of fluorescence (560-nm excitation and 590-nm emission wavelengths). Controls were devoid of cell extracts and generated no change in AB fluorescence. All experiments were done at least in triplicate. Statistical analyses were carried out by Student'sttest. Gm treatment is more lethal to, and causes greater oxidative stress in, therpoSmutant ofE. coli. The ΔrpoSmutant ofE. coliis more sensitive to Gm than the wild type (WT). Data presented here and subsequently are for stationary-phase cells.E. coliK-12, strain BW25113 was used, except where otherwise indicated. Gm was used at a concentration of 16 μg/ml with incubation at 37°C. Solid bars show mean log CFU counts per ml after Gm treatment for 24 h; striped bars represent untreated controls. The Studentttest comparison is between drug-treated and untreated cells of the same strain. **,P< 0.01. Oxidative stress activates the bacterial SOS response, and this activation can be detected by the induction of the SOS-regulated promoter of thesfiAgene (psfiA) (44,45). psfiAactivation thus provides a means of detecting oxidative stress within the cell and can be monitored by the use of ansfiA-lacZtranscriptional fusion. We measured β-galactosidase activity in untreated controls and drug-treated cells. In both the wild-type and the ΔrpoSstrains, psfiAshowed a basal level of expression, which was greater in the mutant (Fig. 2A), indicating intrinsic oxidative stress that was more marked in the latter. This is consistent with the fact that ROS and oxidative stress are generated in the course of normal metabolism (due, for instance, to the leakage of O from the respiratory chain [46,47]) and that therpoSmutant is compromised in mitigating this innate stress (25). Gm treatment activated psfiAin both strains but to a much greater extent in the mutant, indicating that the latter experienced greater drug-mediated oxidative stress. Use of an antioxidant and treatment under anoxia mitigate Gm lethality. If oxidative stress contributes to Gm lethality, it should be minimized by coadministration of an antioxidant. We usedN-acetyl cysteine (NAC) to test this. Both the wild-type and the ΔrpoSstrains were more tolerant of Gm when NAC was also administered, indicating that countering the oxidative stress was protective. The protection was more marked in the mutant (Fig. 3A), consistent with the greater oxidative stress that the drug generated in this strain (Fig. 2and3A). Coadministration ofN-acetyl cysteine (5 mg/ml) (A) and anaerobiosis (B) decrease Gm lethality in stationary-phase cells in both the wild type and the ΔrpoSmutant but to a greater extent in the latter. Bars show survival after 24 h of Gm treatment under the specified conditions. Asterisks indicatePvalues in comparisons of NAC treatment or anoxic effects within the same strains. *,P< 0.05; ***,P< 0.001. Anaerobiosis prevents ROS formation. Would it also mitigate Gm toxicity? Gm uptake is mediated by the proton motive force (PMF), but PMF is decreased, not eliminated, under anaerobiosis as the ATP synthetase continues to extrude protons (56), and Gm retains lethality under these conditions (26). Gm exposure under anoxia had an effect similar to that of aerobic coadministration of NAC and Gm (Fig. 3B): the drug tolerance increased in both the wild type and the mutant but to a far greater extent in the latter (74-fold versus 2.3-fold in the wild type). Both strains retained sensitivity to the drug under these conditions, indicating the drug's ability to kill the bacteria by means other than the oxidative stress; this stress therefore augments, and does not replace, Gm killing by inhibition of protein synthesis. Absence of antioxidant proteins also rendersE. colimore sensitive to Gm and prone to greater drug-mediated oxidative stress. Deletion of ROS quencher proteins or PPP enzymes rendersE. colimore sensitive to Gm. Effect of Gm treatment was determined as described in the legend ofFig. 1on strains lacking ROS quencher proteins (ΔkatEΔsodAand ΔsodAΔsodBmutants) or PPP enzymes (ΔzwfΔgndand ΔtalAmutants). Solid bars represent the effect of Gm treatment; bars with stripes represent untreated controls. The effect of the drug on the wild type is reproduced fromFig. 1for reference. Asterisks indicatePvalues for Gm-treated and untreated cells of the same strain. *,P< 0.05; **,P< 0.01; ***,P< 0.001. To directly test if the PPP plays a role in Gm tolerance of stationary-phaseE. coli, we tested mutants lacking selected enzymes of this pathway. The Δzwfand Δgndmutants, lacking glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, respectively, exhibited marginally increased sensitivity (data not shown), and since the activity of these enzymes also can be supplanted by other proteins (61,62), we tested a ΔzwfΔgnddouble mutant. This mutant was markedly more sensitive (Fig. 4). The ΔtalAmutant, missing the PPP enzyme transaldolase A, likewise showed increased Gm sensitivity, which was decreased by coadministration of NAC (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material), implicating the contribution of oxidative stress in the mutant's increased vulnerability. Gm treatment generates greater oxidative stress in mutants lacking quencher or PPP proteins than in the wild type. (A) Activation of SOS response at 24 h, as monitored by measuring β-galactosidase activity after Gm treatment in the quencher (ΔsodAΔsodBmutant) or PPP (ΔzwfΔgndmutant) class of mutants containing a single copy of thesfiA-lacZfusion. (B) Effect of 24-h Gm treatment on protein carbonylation in the ΔsodAΔsodB, ΔzwfΔgnd, and ΔtalAmutants as detected by slot blot analysis. Data on the wild type are reproduced fromFig. 2for comparison. Asterisks indicatePvalues for Gm-treated and untreated cells of the same strain (*,P< 0.05; **,P< 0.01; ***,P< 0.001), and daggers represent comparisons between untreated cells of the wild type and the mutant (††,P< 0.01; †††,P< 0.001). TherpoSmutant of the uropathogenic strain ofE. coli(UPEC) is more sensitive to Gm in a mouse model of bladder infection. To examine the clinical relevance of the above findings, we worked with the uropathogenic strain ofE. coli(UPEC), AMG1 (34,35), and its isogenic ΔrpoSmutant. UPEC causes infection of the urinary tract, and Gm is used in treating this disease. Gm caused greater killing and oxidative stress in the stationary-phase ΔrpoSmutant also of this strainin vitro(see Fig. S3 in the supplemental material). We used a mouse model (39) to examine whether this difference also occurredin vivo. As before, for these studies we sought a Gm concentration that would selectively affect the infective capability of the mutant and tested 50, 5, and 0.5 μg of the drug. Transurethrally injected stationary-phase wild-type and ΔrpoSmutant strains colonized the bladder of female CBA/J mice when no Gm was administered. Treatment with 50 or 5 μg of drug prevented colonization by both strains, but 0.5 μg prevented bladder colonization by the mutant only (Fig. 6A). Administration of NAC intraperitoneally 1 h before the bacterial injection enabled the mutant to colonize the bladder at this Gm concentration (Fig. 6B), showing that diminished oxidative stress made the mutant more resistant to the drug. (Controls receiving PBS instead of NAC showed no difference.) We interpret this to show that, at higher concentrations, the ability of Gm to disrupt protein synthesis is strong enough not to be affected by the defective antioxidant defense of the mutant, but at a low concentration, the drug relies also on the added effect of oxidative stress to be effective. A strong enough attack on elements of theE. coliantioxidant defense, for example, by small-molecule inhibitors of the proteins identified above, should therefore enhance Gm effectiveness in combating this disease and permit the use of lower drug concentrations, thereby minimizing drug side effects such as nephrotoxicity (64,65). Gm increases electron leakage from the respiratory chain. Relative fluorescence units (RFU) of alamarBlue are shown for the membrane fraction of cell extracts of stationary-phaseE. coli(BW25113) containing rotenone without (CE, for cell extract) and with (CE+Gm) Gm. ***,P< 0.001. See the text for further details. As noted, stationary-phase bacteria play critical roles in disease causation, and it is important to develop means for their control (3,4,11–15,17,18,70), which is addressed in this study. TherpoSmutant of the twoE. colistrains examined here exhibited greater Gm sensitivity than the wild type (Fig. 1). Although this is reported so far only for 24 h of Gm treatment, we determined this for therpoSmutant and selected other mutants after 48 and 72 h of Gm treatment. While increased drug exposure time generated greater killing of all strains, the mutants continued to show greater sensitivity (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). That the increased oxidative stress in the ΔrpoSmutant contributed to increased Gm lethality of this strain is shown by the fact that the drug toxicity was significantly mitigated when Gm treatment accompanied the administration of the antioxidant NAC or when cells were exposed to Gm under anaerobic conditions that prevent ROS formation. Experiments with the uropathogenic strain ofE. coli(AMG1) (34,35) in a mouse urinary tract infection (UTI) model showed that this is the case alsoin vivo: Gm at a low concentration compromised the ability of the UPECrpoSmutant to colonize female mouse bladder but not when the antioxidant NAC was also administered (Fig. 6). Additional evidence bolsters the conclusion that an intact antioxidant defense is important in Gm tolerance of stationary-phaseE. coli. Thus, disrupting this defense by the elimination of the quencher proteins SodA/SodB or KatE/SodA also subjected these bacteria to greater Gm-mediated oxidative stress (Fig. 5) and increased lethality (Fig. 4). It has been shown that the combined loss of SodA and SodB renders exponential-phaseE. colialso more sensitive to certain bactericidal drugs (58), but it has not been previously shown in stationary-phase cells nor in the context of the σs-regulated stress response. The loss of Zwf/Gnd or of the TalA protein of the PPP, which supplies the NADPH that fuels the quencher proteins and is a well-established part of the antioxidant defense (59,60), also imposed greater oxidative stress (Fig. 5) and rendered the cells more sensitive to the drug (Fig. 4); this sensitivity too was minimized by NAC coadministration (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material). To our knowledge, this is the first time that the PPP has been implicated in resistance to a bactericidal drug. This pathway also supplies pentoses required in ribosome function, and its disruption and the resulting potential pentose scarcity may have also contributed to enhanced Gm lethality in these mutants by exacerbating inhibition of protein synthesis. The NAC effect, however, clearly affirms the role of oxidative stress. The mutants of both the quencher and PPP classes showed different degrees of increase in Gm sensitivity (Fig. 4). This is unsurprising, given that the quencher proteins involved likely differ in decomposing the major reactive species generated by Gm and that the mutational loss of a vital function can activate metabolic networks with different capacities to compensate for it (73,74). Other findings also point to the fact that Gm generates oxidative stress. Thus, in mice, this drug significantly increases kidney myeloperoxidase activity, lipid peroxidation, and protein carbonylation. It has been shown that the resulting acute renal failure is caused by ROS, and the use of M40403, which is a low-molecular-weight mimetic of superoxide dismutase, attenuates this damage (64,65,75). Similarly, proteomic analysis implicates Gm-mediated oxidative stress inLeishmaniasince the proteins affected by drug exposure included the thiol-redox control system (76). Furthermore, it was shown that Gm-mediated ROS production can enhance the effectiveness of drugs like camptothecin and digitoxin against the lung cancer cell line NCI-H460 (77). It needs to be emphasized that the established mechanism of Gm action on bacteria is not questioned by these data; instead, they show that an additional mechanism—oxidative stress—has a role in the lethality of this drug in stationary-phase cells. It is clear that neither NAC nor anaerobiosis rendered the drug harmless (Fig. 3), and it was only at a low dose of Gm that the administration of NAC was needed to bolster the colonizing ability of therpoSmutant (Fig. 6). Other factors were therefore involved, and it is logical to assume that inhibition of protein synthesis continued to have a key role in the toxicity of the drug. This study, however, has detected new targets to enhance the effectiveness of Gm. Even though some of the proteins implicated have mammalian orthologues, sufficient differences exist between the pro- and eukaryotic proteins that selective targeting of the former should be possible.
