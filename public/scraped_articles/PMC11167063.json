  "content": "Telomeric RNA (TERRA) increases in response to spaceflight and high-altitude climbing Received 2023 Dec 3; Accepted 2024 Mar 6; Collection date 2024. Subject terms:Genetics, Molecular biology Transcriptomics (RNA-seq) data reveal significantly increased telomeric RNA, or TERRA, in response to spaceflight and radiation exposure (compared to baseline and ground control samples). Telomeres are specialized nucleoprotein “caps” at the natural ends of chromosomes essential for maintaining genome stability. Telomeres face two major challenges as a result of their physical location: the inability to replicate to the very end of linear DNA molecules (the end replication problem)1,2; and circumventing activation of inappropriate DNA damage responses (DDRs) (the end protection problem)3,4. Mammalian telomeres are composed of tandem arrays of highly conserved repetitive G-rich sequence (5’-TTAGGG/CCCTAA-3’)5–7, which in humans range in length from ~5 to 15 kb and end in 3’ single-stranded G-rich overhangs of ~30–500 nucleotides8,9. The 3’ single-stranded telomeric overhang serves as the substrate for telomerase, the specialized reverse transcriptase capable of de novo addition of telomeric repeats onto newly synthesized telomeres10. Telomeric 3’ overhangs also facilitate formation of protective terminal structural features termed t-loops11,12. Telomeres are dynamic structures associated with a myriad of telomere-specific and nonspecific proteins, six of which comprise the shelterin complex and include the telomere-repeat binding factors TRF1 and TRF2, which contributes to regulation of telomerase activity, t-loop formation, and protection of chromosome ends8,13–15. Normal human somatic cells have very low levels of telomerase activity, and thus telomeres shorten with continued cell division, as well as with oxidative stress and a variety of lifestyle factors, including chronic stressors and environmental exposures16–22. Telomere shortening is a key molecular driver of aging and determinant of age-related degenerative pathologies, including dementias, cardiovascular disease, and cancer23–25. Telomerase activity is sufficient to maintain telomere length only in highly proliferative populations like germ-line and stem cells, and the vast majority of cancers26. The remaining ~10–15% of human cancers maintain telomere length via the telomerase-independent, recombination- mediated Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT) pathway27–29. ALT tumors display a number of distinguishing features, including heterogeneous telomere lengths, increased frequencies of telomere sister chromatid exchange (T-SCE), ALT-associated PML bodies (APBs), and extrachromosomal telomeric repeats (ETCRs)30–32. Due to their repetitive and heterochromatic nature, telomeres were long regarded as silent, rather unremarkable regions of the genome. Therefore, discovery of TElomere Repeat-containing RNA, or TERRA, propelled the field into new areas of research and potential mechanisms of telomere maintenance33,34. TERRA, a presumed long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) until recently35, ranges in length from ~ one hundred to over 9000 nucleotides and is transcribed from CpG islands within subtelomeric regions towards chromosomal termini by RNA Pol II, predominantly using the C-rich leading-strand as a template and producing 5’-UUAGGG-3’ transcripts33,36,37. TERRA is thought to accumulate preferentially at short telomeres, where it contributes to end-capping structure and function via regulation of telomere length and maintenance of genome stability38–40. TERRA can also indirectly associate with telomeres via shelterin proteins41,42, as well as interact with an array of RNA binding proteins, including heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNPA1)43,44. In telomerase-positive human cells, TERRA is primarily chromatin-associated (bound) and not polyadenylated (polyA-), while “free” (unbound) TERRA is polyadenylated at its 3’-end (polyA+) and represents ~7% of total TERRA33,36. Such an “end-view” of TERRA is consistent with strict inhibition of DDRs at telomeres, which prevents spurious end-joining and genomic instability54,55, but also renders telomeres refractory to repair when damage does occur within and/or near telomeric regions; e.g., telomeric regions are especially susceptible to oxidative damage due to their G-rich makeup56,57. Telomere site-specific endonucleases have been developed and employed to address the question of how, and even whether, double-strand breaks (DSBs) within telomeres are repaired58–60. We previously utilized transient transfection of the well-characterized endonuclease TRAS1-EN fused to TRF1 (EN-T) targeting system61,62in human BJ1-hTERT apparently normal fibroblasts, as well as in EJ-30 telomerase positive and U2OS (ALT) cancer cells, to evaluate telomeric DSBs specifically in G1-phase of the cell cycle63. Telomere dysfunction-induced foci (TIFs) provided a valuable biomarker of broken telomeres, as they represent co-localization of the well-established DSB marker gamma (γ)-H2AX at telomeres64. Importantly, induction of telomere-specific DSBs resulted in extensive tracks of resected 5’ C-rich single-stranded telomeric DNA in all cell lines (independent of telomerase status), a previously proposed biomarker of the recombination dependent ALT pathway65,66. We posited that such highly reactive and exposed DNA “ends” were protected by binding complementary TERRA and forming telomeric DNA:RNA hybrids, so that they might persist into S/G2 for recombination-mediated elongation as a means of repair. Here, to better understand the role of telomeric RNA in the telomeric DDR, we investigated TERRA associated with ionizing radiation- and telomere specific-induced damage in normal human blood in vivo (during spaceflight and high-altitude ascent of Mt. Everest), and in human U2OS (ALT) cells in vitro. Telomeres and TERRA in the space radiation DNA damage response Similarly, for the 2021 SpaceX Inspiration4 all civilian crew, telomere elongation (in blood) was observed in all 4 crewmembers during the 3-day, high-elevation (590 km) orbital mission71,72. Consistent with our previous studies of astronauts living and working in the space radiation environment22,73, stress-related responses to oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysregulation, inflammation, and DNA damage were also enriched during the Inspiration4 mission and correlated with telomere length dynamics71,74–76, thus supporting this phenotype as a consistent human response to spaceflight that is thus far independent of mission duration (3 days, 6 months, 1 year). Moreover, our previous cell-by-cell cytogenetic observations of ALT/ALT-like phenotypes during spaceflight (heterogeneous telomere lengths; very long and very short)22, as well as pathway analyses that implicated ALT and recombination-based maintenance of telomeres in two high altitude climbers – who also experienced telomere elongation associated with climbing Mt. Everest68, supported our overall supposition that due to telomeres’ particular susceptibility to oxidative damage, the ALT pathway of telomere maintenance may be transiently activated in normal cells during chronic exposure22. We have reported individual differences in response68, as well as provided support for the mechanistic role of radiation exposure underlying changes in telomere length dynamics and persistent DDRs; specifically, telomere elongation (in blood) was observed in a cohort of 15 prostate cancer patients immediately following three months of radiation therapy (IMRT)77,78.

Transcription-dependent TERRA foci increase in response to IR-induced DNA damage/DSBs. Telomere-specific DSBs induced by the EN-T targeting system Due to the random distribution of DSBs induced by sparsely ionizing radiations, γ-rays would only rarely be expected to directly damage telomeres due to the small fraction of the genome that they occupy. Therefore, to explore the response of TERRA specifically to DSBs that occur within telomeres, we employed the chimeric TRAS1-EN endonuclease fused to TRF1 (EN-T) targeting system61,62in human U2OS (ALT) cells. We previously demonstrated the utility of this well-characterized system for inducing telomeric DSBs in human normal and cancer cell lines63. Here, populations of cycling U2OS cells were transiently transfected with EN-T, TRF1-only (positive control), or empty vector (EV, transfection control), and then compared to untransfected (UT) negative control populations. TERRA response and recruitment to telomeric DSB sites Taken together, these findings suggest that in addition to newly transcribed, nascent TERRA being retained at extensively resected 5’ C-rich single-stranded telomeric DNA at telomeric DSB damage sites, readily-available, free TERRA is also recruited to telomeric DSB sites, with both forming protective telomeric DNA:RNA hybrids41,63. TERRA accumulates at telomeric-DSBs in G2 ALT cells In light of TERRA’s emerging roles in DNA damage and cellular stress responses39, we speculated that TERRA might play a role in ionizing radiation and/or telomeric DDRs. To test this, we investigated telomeric RNA, or TERRA, levels in astronauts experiencing the low dose/low dose-rate space radiation environment and in ground-based high-altitude climbers of Mt. Everest (normal human blood in vivo), as well as in normal human PBMCs exposed to simulated microgravity, and in human U2OS (ALT) cells utilizing in vitro radiation exposures and the chimeric EN-T telomeric DSB targeting system62,63,68. Mechanistically insightful was the observation that simulated microgravity alone did not induce similar increases in TERRA abundance. Although terrestrial analogs like rotating wall vessels or random positioning machines may not precisely replicate microgravity conditions in space, they are often used for such purposes as a proxy94, since they are the only reasonable or available option, and they facilitate testing the isolated effect of this single stressor. Our finding of elevated abundance of TERRA transcripts in the Earth-bound high-altitude climbers of Mt Everest in vivo, who also experienced telomere elongation and evidence of ALT-like activity in this somewhat similar stressful and higher-radiation environment68, further supports this conclusion. Also relevant in this regard is that radiation dose rates from more damaging cosmic radiations increase with altitude, and doses per Everest expedition are in the range of 1 mSv [International Radiation Protection Association]. Given the intriguing human in vivo evidence, we pursued in vitro studies to characterize the response and investigate whether TERRA might be involved in a general DNA damage response to IR-induced DSBs. Human U2OS ALT cells were utilized due to their high levels of TERRA, as well as the indications of ALT/ALT-like activity observed during spaceflight and the high-altitude ascent of Mt. Everest68,95. Transcription-dependent increases in the numbers of TERRA foci were observed in irradiated populations (compared to non-irradiated controls), consistent with previous reports of upregulation of TERRA following treatment with the chemotherapeutic and radiomimetic drug bleomycin96, as well as with increased TERRA transcription upon treatment with etoposide, a topoisomerase II inhibitor that induces DSBs97. Because all of these DNA damaging agents induce DSBs randomly throughout the genome, we next queried whether TERRA might be responding specifically to DSBs within telomeres themselves. To address this possibility, we employed the EN-T targeting system due to its effective induction of telomere-specific DSBs as opposed to single-strand damage, such as that induced by reactive oxygen species62,90, an important consideration since oxidative stress is also associated with IR exposure and has been shown to increase TERRA levels in normal cells98,99. Telomere-specific DSBs induced by EN-T and TRF1-only (positive control in U2OS ALT cells) were confirmed via triple co-localization of FLAG-γH2AX-telomere foci, events not observed with empty-vector transfected or untransfected populations. Importantly, hybridized TERRA was directly visualized specifically at telomeric DSB damage sites, as evidenced by triple co-localization of FLAG-TERRA-TRF2 foci. Furthermore, a striking redistribution of abundant and “free” (unbound) TERRA to hybridized (bound) TERRA occurred in response to induction of telomere-specific DSBs, supportive evidence of TERRA:telomeric DNA hybrid formation at break sites. Simulated microgravity experiments De-identified peripheral blood buffy coat samples were obtained from 2 healthy human donors between the ages of 25 and 36 from the Stanford University Blood Center (IRB eProtocol# 13942). PBMCs were isolated using a Ficoll gradient method. Cells were counted and re-suspended in complete media at 1 × 106cells/ml (RPMI 1640, 10% Fetal Bovine Serum, 2mM L-Glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 0.1 mM non-essential Amino acid, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 50 uM 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mM HEPES). The cell suspension of PBMCs was loaded into 10 ml disposable rotating wall vessels (Synthecon, Houston, TX) and rotated at 15 rpm for 25 hr to generate simulated microgravity. For the 1 G control, the cell suspension was plated in standard 6-well culture plates. 1 G and simulated microgravity cultures were simultaneously placed in the same 37 °C, 5% CO2incubator. For single-cell RNA sequencing, 1 × 104PBMCs from each condition were counted and loaded on the 10X Genomics Chromium Controller, and the libraries were prepared using Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 5’ Reagent Kit v2 according to the manufacturer’s protocol (10X Genomics, Pleasanton, CA). The quality of libraries was assessed using Agilent TapeStation 4200, and test-sequenced on Illumina NextSeq 550. The full sequencing was performed on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 by SeqMatic (Fremont, CA). FASTQ (raw data) files were processed through 10x Genomics Cell Ranger v6.1.2 pipeline and all bases with quality below Q20 were truncated. The “cellranger count” function was used to perform transcriptome alignment, filtering, and UMI counting, and then to generate the count matrixes. Alignment was done against the human genome GRCh38-2020-A. In vitro ionizing radiation experiments U2OS cells were seeded into 4-well chamber slides (Nunc Lab-Tek II 154526) at a density of 5×105cells/well and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2to allow cell attachment. Cells were either sham-irradiated (0 Gy) or exposed to137Cs γ-rays (2 Gy) while rotating in a Mark I irradiator (J.L Sheppard) located at Colorado State University. Cells were then returned to the incubator for 4 hours prior to fixation. For inhibition of transcription and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) analyses, U2OS cells were seeded into 6-well plates (2 × 105cells/well) 24 h prior to addition of 10 ug/ml Actinomycin-D (ActD; ThermoFisher). Cells were collected in Trizol at 3, 6, 8 and 24 hr after treatment. Control U2OS cells (DMSO treated) were collected after 24 h. RNA (500 ng) was used to make cDNA using standard reverse transcription (ImPromII-Reverse Transcription System-Promega). 25 µL reaction mixtures containing GAPDH or 18S rRNA primers, template (1:10,000 dilution cDNA) and QX200™ ddPCR™ EvaGreen Supermix (Bio-Rad: 186–4034) were used for the ddPCR platform (QX200 Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR™) System – Bio-Rad). Droplet generation and transfer of emulsified samples to PCR plates was performed according to manufacturer’s instructions (Instruction Manual, QX200™ Droplet Generator – Bio-Rad). The cycling protocol for the ddPCR platform started with a 95 °C enzyme activation step for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of a two-step cycling protocol (95 °C for 30 s and 60 °C for 1 min) with a ramp rate of 2 °C/second. Post-cycling protocol was in accordance with the kit instructions (Bio-Rad –186–4034). For TERRA foci detection following inhibition of transcription, U2OS cells on chamber-slides were treated with 10 ug/ml ActD, 3 and 8 h prior to IR exposure; cells were fixed and TERRA foci detected using RNA-FISH as described below. In vitro cell culture and transfections Human U2OS ALT cells (provided by Dr. Jiri Lucas, University of Copenhagen) were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Hyclone) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2. TRAS1-EN-TRF1 (EN-T) and TRF1-only plasmids, both driven by a CMV promoter and possessing a C-terminal FLAG-tag for visualization, were constructed from a CMV-driven TRAS1-EN-TRF1 plasmid obtained from Dr. Haruhiko Fujiwara (University of Tokyo). To generate the TRF1-only plasmid, the TRAS1-EN-TRF1construct was digested and the EN fragment removed. The mutated Cas9 pSpCas9m(BB)-2A-Puro (PX462) V2.0 (empty vector) plasmid (Addgene plasmid #62987;http://n2t.net/addgene:62987; RRID:Addgene_62987) was provided by Dr. Claudia Wiese (Colorado State University). Transient transfections of EN-T, TRF1-only (positive control; previously shown to recruit γ-H2AX to telomeres in U2OS ALT cells)88, and empty vector (EV; transfection control) using Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen) were performed per manufacturer’s instructions on cell cultures reaching ~60–80% confluency in Opti-MEM (Gibco), which was replaced with regular media 8 h later. Untransfected (UT; negative control) populations had neither plasmid nor Lipofectamine, and unless specified otherwise all experiments were carried out 48 h post-transfection. A U2OS cell line stably expressing FUCCI-Geminin (green; S-G2-M) was established by transfecting cells with 0.5 ug of the Kan-FUCCI-Green (S-G2-M) plasmid (AM-V9016, Amalgaam) as previously described63. Briefly, plasmids were delivered using Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Eight hours following transfection, Opti-MEM media was replaced with fresh DMEM media. One week later, cells were trypsinized and individual cells were seeded into a 96-well plate. A single positive clone was identified and expanded in the presence of 800 μg/ml G-418 sulfate (GoldBio). After reaching ~90% confluency, cells were split into a 24-well plate, then 10 days later into a 12-well plate, and one week later into a 6-well plate. Cells were transferred into T-25 flasks, and then after 6 days into T-75 flasks. The DMEM media containing 800 μg/ml G-418 sulfate was changed every two days. FUCCI-U2OS cells stably expressing FUCCI G2-Green were transiently transfected with EN-T or TRF1-only plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following manufacture’s instruction. Eight hours following transfection, Opti-MEM media was replaced with fresh DMEM media, and cells were fixed 48 h post-transfection. RNA fluorescence in-situ hybridization (RNA-FISH) For combined telomeric C-rich strand detection and FLAG staining, U2OS expressing FUCCI-SG2-M-Green cells were grown on 4-well chamber slides (MilliCell EZ). Forty-eight hours following transfection, chambers were removed and slides washed with Cytoskeleton (CSK) buffer (100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, 10 mM PIPES at pH 6.8, 3 mM MgCl2, 300 mM sucrose) containing 200 mM vanadyl for 30 seconds. Cells were then fixed in freshly prepared 3% paraformaldehyde in 10X PBS for 12 minutes at room temperature, and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in CSK buffer containing 200 mM vanadyl for 7 min at room temperature. Cells were washed with 70% ethanol and dehydrated through a graded ethanol series (85%, 95%, 100%). For TERRA (UUAGGG) detection, 0.5 uM (TelC-Alexa 488, Bio-Synthesis) or (TelC- Alexa 647, Bio PNA 1013) Peptide Nucleic Acid (PNA-CCCTAA) telomere probe was added to the hybridization buffer [50% (vol/vol) formamide, 2X (vol/vol) saline sodium citrate (SSC)] with 200 mM vanadyl, and denatured at 85 °C for 10 min and then cooled on ice. Hybridization buffer (200 ul) was added to each slide and slides were placed in a humidified chamber and incubated at 37 °C for 6 h. Slides were washed twice in 50% formamide in 2X SSC (2.5 min, 42 °C), twice in 4X SSC (2.5 min, 42 °C), and once in 2X SSC + 0.1% NP-40 (2.5 min, 42 °C). To remove both bound and unbound TERRA, fixed and permeabilized U2OS and U2OS FUCCI-S-G2-M-Green cells were treated with a cocktail of 1 mg/ml RNaseA (degrades free RNA) and 15 U RNaseH (cleaves RNA from DNA:RNA hybrids) in 1X RNaseH buffer for 1 h at 37 °C. Blocking nonspecific immunoglobulin binding following FISH was carried out with 10% Goat Normal Serum (GNS) for 30 min in a humidified chamber at room temperature. Slides were then incubated with primary antibody in 5% GNS overnight at 4 °C. Slides were washed three times with 1X PBS at room temperature. Protein signals were visualized by incubating slides with fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibody for 40 min in a humidified chamber at room temperature and washed three times in 1X PBS. Lastly, slides were mounted and counterstained with Prolong Gold antifade reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen). Primary antibodies and concentrations used include mouse antiFLAG (Sigma M2 F1804, 1:2000), rabbit anti-human FLAG (Sigma 7425 1:300), mouse anti-human TRF2 (Santa Cruz B-5, 1:200), and mouse anti-phospho-Histone H2A.X (Ser139), clone JBW301 (Sigma 05-636, 1:10). Secondary antibodies and concentrations used include: Alexa-647 goat anti-mouse (ThermoFisher A21236, 1:750), Alexa-594 goat anti-mouse (ThermoFisher A11005, 1:750), Alexa488 goat anti-rabbit (ThermoFisher A11008, 1:750). For EdU detection, Click-iT EdU Alexa Flour 555 (Invitrogen) was used according to manufacturer’s instructions. Utilizing a U2OS cell line stably expressing FUCCI-Geminin, the cell cycle phase of interphase nuclei was determined. Definitive identification of cells in S-phase was achieved via pulse-labeling with the thymidine analog 5-Ethynyl-2´-deoxyuridine (EdU) for 30 min prior to fixation; 10 uM EdU (Click-iT, Invitrogen) was added to the culture and incubated at 37 °C. The scoring strategy to distinguish cell cycle phase of transiently transfected FUCCI U2OS cells was defined as cells positive for FLAG were in G1, cells positive for FLAG and EdU were in S, and cells positive for FLAG and GemininGFP were in G2. Microscopy and quantitative analysis Images were captured using a Zeiss Axio Imager.Z2 epi-fluorescent microscope outfitted with a 63X/1.4 N.A objective and a Coolsnap ES2 camera, and analyzed using Zen Blue software. Images were captured for co-localization 3-D analyses (50 per condition), each consisting of 21 Z-stacks (0.2 µm per plane) in combinations of 4 wavelengths (colors). Quantitative analysis was performed using Fiji (ImageJ2 software) and Cell Profiler using our customized pipeline for 3D reconstructions and simultaneous dual and triple co-localizations of the different markers. For RNA-seq data analysis, the total baseline counts of all 5-, 6-, and 7-mers were calculated with jellyfish109in both the single nuclei RNA-Seq data (Inspiration4) and poly(A) + RNA-Seq data (Twins Study). These data were filtered for reads containing UUAGGG 6-mers, accounting for reverse complementarity. In these sets of reads, the counts of all 5-, 6-, and 7-mers were again calculated, accounting for circular shifts; the normalized count of eachk-mer was calculated as its absolute count divided by the total count of allk-mers in the dataset for eachk(5 ≤k≤ 7). Considering the different experimental designs (Inspiration4: longitudinal cohort; Twins Study: synchronized subject/control; and Mt. Everest climbers: longitudinal cohort), we classified the data into conceptually similar categories: ground (either pre-flight or ground control), space effect (either in-flight or immediately post-flight), and recovery (long-term post-flight); and for the Mount Everest data, pre-ascent (low altitude), ascent (high altitude), and descent (low altitude). The simulated data was classified into microgravity (uG) and Earth gravity (1 G) categories. For telomeric RNA-FISH (TERRA) analysis following IR exposure with and without inhibition of transcription (Actinomycin-D treatment), TERRA foci were counted in treated and control (DMSO) groups using Metamorph 7.7 (Fig.3a). Data represent 2 independent experiments (50 cells scored for each condition). Statistical significance was assessed by two-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test. Informed consent was obtained from all human research participants. The Inspiration4 crewmembers were consented at an informed consent briefing conducted at SpaceX (Hawthorne, CA), and samples were collected and processed under approval of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Weill Cornell Medicine, under Protocol 21-05023569. The NASA Twins Study subjects and the Everest climbers were consented under WCM IRB protocol #1309014347. All participants consented for data and sample sharing.
