Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is a major health problem that manifests as an abrupt decline in renal function after iodine contrast exposure. CIN is known as the third most common cause of hospital-acquired acute kidney injury [1]. CIN contributes to chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression and prolonged length of hospital stay. Moreover, the rapidly increasing use of computed tomography scans or interventions using contrast agents, such as angiography, is raising concerns regarding CIN. In addition, there are limited options for the prevention and treatment of CIN, including fluid therapy and avoidance of additional nephrotoxins. Potential pathogenic mechanisms of CIN include vasoconstriction, medullary hypoxia, direct cytotoxicity, oxidative stress, and increased tubular fluid viscosity [2]. Previous experimental studies have mainly focused on direct tubular toxicity, vasoconstriction, and oxidative stress following contrast exposure [3]. Many researchers have linked the physicochemical properties of iodinated contrast materials to CIN. The administered volume, osmolality, and viscosity of contrast media (CM) may be related to nephrotoxicity [4]. Indeed, high-osmolar ionic CM is no longer used because of the high risk of adverse drug reactions and renal toxicity [5]. Currently, two types of contrast agents are widely used in clinical practice: high-viscosity iso-osmolar contrast media (IOCM) and low-viscosity low-osmolar contrast media (LOCM). IOCM has an osmolality similar to that of blood (290 mOsm/kg), while LOCM has a higher osmolality (600–900 mOsm/kg) than IOCM. Some studies have suggested the superiority of IOCM over LOCM in the prevention of CIN [6,7]. However, there was no difference in the overall risk of CIN according to the type of CM in meta-analyses [8,9]. It still remains unclear which of these two types of CM is better for renal safety. To date, the effect of CM viscosity on renal function has not been fully investigated due to the difficulty in experimental methodology. Accurately controlling and measuring fluid viscosity and shear stress is challenging in conventional experimental designs. Under in vivo conditions, the high viscosity of IOCM can be harmful to renal function. IOCM is further concentrated in the renal medulla with increasing viscosity, particularly in dehydrated individuals, which increases intraluminal pressure and decreases the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) [10]. Nevertheless, previous in vitro studies in static conditions showed that LOCM has more cytotoxic effects than IOCM [11]. However, this static condition does not reflect the rheological effects of CM. Given that animal models for CIN are not well established and clinical trials are much harder to implement due to high cost and ethical issues [12], alternative experimental approaches are warranted. In the field of nephrology, organ-on-a-chip technology is gradually being utilized for physiological in vitro disease models [13]. One of the key features of the organ-on-a-chip is the exposure of cells to easily controlled microfluidic conditions, which could enable rheological studies. Therefore, organ-on-a-chip experiments could be an alternative approach to bridge the gap between the in vitro and in vivo findings in CIN. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the nephrotoxic effects of the rheological factors of LOCM and IOCM using a kidney-on-a-chip platform. 2.1.

Viscosity of contrast media according to different iodine concentrations. In the present study, we investigated CM-induced nephrotoxicity under shear-stress conditions using kidney-on-a-chip models compared to that under static conditions. RPTEC was treated with varying iodine concentrations of IOCM and LOCM, which reflect renal concentrating process. Because IOCM and LOCM have different osmolalities and viscosities, we compared the nephrotoxic effects of each contrast agent in terms of physicochemical stress and performed mathematical simulations. IOCM and LOCM were used to evaluate the effects of high viscosity and osmolality on renal tubular cells, respectively. We tested each experimental group under different shear-stress conditions. Fluid shear-stress in vivo in human proximal tubules is estimated to be 0.1–1 dyn/cm2[14,15,16]; however, it was applied differently depending on the experimental conditions [17]. In a rectangular pipe-shaped channel of the OrganoPlate, the fluid shear-stress (τ) can be calculated asτ=6µQbh2, where b and h represent the width and height of the channel, respectively, Q represents the flow rate, and μ denotes the fluid viscosity. The fluid shear-stress is approximately 0.13 dyn/cm2when the rocker is set at an inclination of ±7° and an interval of 8 min [18]. Given that a single nephron glomerular filtrate directly reaches the initial part of the proximal tubule, a single nephron glomerular filtration rate (SNGFR) can be used for the calculation of shear stress. The SNGFR of healthy adults has been reported to be 80 ± 40 nL/min [19], and the diameter of the proximal tubule has been reported to be ~60 μm [20,21]. The fluid shear-stress at the proximal tubular wall can be calculated asτ=4µQπR2under the assumption of a laminar, incompressible Newtonian flow of urine filtrate through a cylindrical tube, where R represents the radius of the proximal tubule. Since about 60–70% of the filtered water and sodium is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule [22], fluid shear-stress in the human proximal tubule ranges from approximately 0.44 (initial part) to 0.13 (distal part) dyn/cm2(at 37 °C), which is comparable to that in the OrganoPlate. CKD is accompanied by a progressive loss of functioning glomeruli in the kidneys. Depending on renal disease, nephron loss induces an increase in the SNGFR of remaining nephrons [23]. These phenomena are particularly observed in post-nephrectomy animal models [24]. To mimic progressive nephron loss, we designed different mean flow rate conditions with varying rocker intervals (8 min, 4 min, and 2 min) applied to the chips. Mathematical simulation was performed using Python (Python Software Foundation, Wilmington, DE, USA) and gnuplot to examine the flow rate and shear stress in the upper channel of the chip. The test fluids, including iodinated CMs, were regarded as Newtonian fluids with constant viscosity and incompressibility. Parameters such as the dimensions of the OrganoPlate provided by the manufacturer were used. Mass density and dynamic viscosity at 37 °C were used for the calculations. Different viscosities of test fluids and rocking conditions were also considered. The shear stress and fluid flow rate at each time point during a single cycle of rocking were calculated. The time-averaged shear-stress and flow rate were calculated from the average of each value over multiple cycles of bidirectional flows. Three-dimensional images were reconstructed using the ImageJ software (NIH, USA). Graph plotting and data analysis were performed using GraphPad Prism 9 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Data are presented as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Each experiment was performed and analyzed in triplicate. Differences between experimental groups were compared using ANOVA and Bonferronit-tests.pvalues < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

In the present study, we suggest an alternative in vitro model of CIN using a three-dimensional proximal tubule-on-a-chip. Renal tubular cell injury induced by IOCM and LOCM was examined under different iodine concentrations and shear-stress conditions, which represent urine concentrations depending on the hydration status and SNGFR. The high viscosity of the concentrated IOCM noticeably slowed the tubular flow rate and increased the mean shear-stress levels. We identified significant cytotoxic effects from the increased viscosity of IOCM within a three-dimensionally perfused channel, which was not apparent under low-shear-stress conditions. LOCM was cytotoxic, even under static or low-shear-stress conditions, and the cytotoxicity was possibly mediated by Erk1/2 inactivation. However, nephrotoxicity was comparable between LOCM and IOCM under high-shear-stress conditions. Overview of the proposed models of contrast-induced nephropathy. (A) Iso-osmolar contrast media are twice as concentrated as low-osmolar contrast media and have a much greater viscosity. Data from Jost et al. [26]. The concentration and viscosity of CM are obtained from an in vitro dialysis model using polyethylene glycol solution with different osmolalities (290, 500, and 1000 mOsm/kg, which represents the mean osmolality of the renal cortex, outer medulla, and inner medulla, respectively). (B) Overall mechanisms of contrast-induced nephropathy. (C) Comparison of iso-osmolar and low-osmolar contrast media in our model. CM—contrast media; LOCM—low-osmolar contrast media; IOCM—iso-osmolar contrast media; GFR—glomerular filtration rate. Additionally, we evaluated some pathway molecules that have been reported to be linked to CIN. Akt and Erk1/2 are among the molecules involved in cell survival and proliferation [25]. A previous in vitro study of CIN showed that both IOCM and LOCM induced dephosphorylation of Akt and Erk1/2 [25]. In particular, IOCM caused a greater decrease in p-Erk 1/2 in HK2 cells. However, we revealed that decreased phosphorylation of Erk1/2 was only observed in the LOCM group under shear-stress conditions, and there was no difference in p-Akt levels between groups. Although our study was not designed to evaluate the exact mechanistic pathways of CIN, our findings possibly suggest that osmolar stress is associated with dephosphorylation of Erk1/2 or viscosity-related stress induces the activation of Erk1/2. Mechanical stretching of renal proximal tubular cells activates Erk1/2 signaling [42], and high-osmolar CM diatrizoate causes greater dephosphorylation of Erk1/2 compared to iopromide [43]. Collectively, viscosity-mediated nephrotoxicity was prominent under high shear-stress conditions. We found no difference between IOCM and LOCM under high fluid-shear-stress, which was similar to the clinical data. These findings suggest that the risk of CIN does not differ between IOCM and LOCM in patients with CKD. Even in a study showing a better effect of IOCM on renal toxicity, superiority of IOCM was not significant in the subgroup with lower GFR (<45 or 60 mL/min/1.73 m2) [44]. In this context, the kidney-on-a-chip microfluidic platform could be a potential alternative in vitro model, which can provide easier control of various physical parameters. Our study has some limitations. This study highlights the critical role of the rheological effects of CM in terms of tubulodynamics. However, detailed mechanisms that mediate viscosity-induced tubular injury still remain elusive. More sophisticated methodology is warranted to determine the main contributing factors to viscosity-related injury. High viscosity also affects the hemodynamics in peritubular vessels. Therefore, extended microfluidic models combining vascular compartments with tubular counterparts would be useful. In addition, the limitations of the assumptions of the experimental design should be considered. We mathematically regarded the renal tubule as a rigid channel; however, it was highly elastic and deformable. In addition, the bidirectional pulsatile flow used in our model was not the same as the unilateral fluid flow in the renal tubules.
