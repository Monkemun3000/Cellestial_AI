This report was designed to compare spaceflight-induced cellular and physiological adaptations ofCandida albicanscultured in microgravity on the International Space Station across several payloads.C. albicansis a common opportunistic fungal pathogen responsible for a variety of superficial infections as well as systemic and more severe infections in humans. Cumulatively, the propensity of this organism to be widespread through the population, the ability to produce disease in immunocompromised individuals, and the tendency to respond to environmental stress with characteristics associated with increased virulence, require a better understanding of the yeast response to microgravity for spaceflight crew safety. As such, the responses of this yeast cultivated during several missions using two in-flight culture bioreactors were analyzed and compared herein. In general,C. albicanshad a slightly shorter generation time and higher growth propensity in microgravity as compared to terrestrial controls. Rates of cell filamentation differed between bioreactors, but were low and not significantly different between flight and terrestrial controls. Viable cells were retrieved and cultured, resulting in a colony morphology that was similar between cells cultivated in flight and in terrestrial control conditions, and in contrast to that previously observed in a ground-based microgravity analog system. Of importance, yeast demonstrated an increased resistance when challenged during spaceflight with the antifungal agent, amphotericin B. Similar levels of resistance were not observed when challenged with the functionally disparate antifungal drug caspofungin. In aggregate, yeast cells cultivated in microgravity demonstrated a subset of characteristics associated with virulence. In addition, and beyond the value of the specific responses ofC. albicansto microgravity, this report includes an analysis of biological reproducibility across flight opportunities, compares two spaceflight hardware systems, and includes a summary of general flight and payload timelines. Candida albicans(C. albicans) is a commensal fungus found throughout the human body in locations such as the mouth, gastrointestinal tract, vagina, and skin [1,2]. Most infections are superficial, such as fungal nails, yet as an opportunistic pathogen, this yeast is capable of causing severe, life-threatening illness in immunocompromised hosts; therefore, it is a potential concern for crew during long term spaceflight [3,4,5,6]. In addition, the dichotomy between the commensal and pathogenic behaviors ofC. albicansis complex and the molecular events responsible for converting a normally benign commensal into a highly pathogenic organism, which in systemic infections can produce 30–45% mortality, have not been fully elucidated [7,8,9,10,11]. Moreover, the therapeutic repertoire to treat systemicCandidainfections is limited [12]. There are four classes of antifungal agents used clinically, including polyenes (e.g., Amphotericin B), echinocandins (e.g., caspofungin), azoles (e.g., fluconazole) and nucleoside analogs (e.g., flucytosine) [13]. Amphotericin B (AmB) was utilized as an early therapeutic forCandidainfections and its derivatives remain among the most effective treatments for systemic disease [14,15,16]. For these reasons, AmB was chosen for analyses in the microgravity-associated susceptibility studies described herein. It has been proposed that AmB functions at the level of the cell membrane, where it interacts with the yeast-specific sterol, ergosterol, forming pores and compromising membrane integrity [13,15]. In contrast, caspofungin (CAS) was used to evaluate the yeast response to an antifungal agent harboring a mechanism of action distinct from that of AmB. Caspofungin compromises cell wall formation by inhibiting (1–3)-β-D-glucan synthase [11]. C. albicansis a dimorphic eukaryotic organism consisting of spherical yeast form cells and elongated filamentous cells and has been shown to respond to environmental stresses such as temperature, pH, and altered gas environments with physiological characteristics often associated with virulence [17,18,19,20]. Indeed the extreme environment of microgravity presents a unique challenge for organisms that have evolved under normal gravity. Microgravity may provide novel environmental stress cues leading to physiological adaptations or may allow insights into molecular pathways otherwise masked by a gravity-based environment, such as that described for the PseudomonasHfqpathway [21,22]. Among the potential adaptations of interest are those properties ofC. albicans, on both the single and multicellular level, that enable it to infect an immunocompromised host. A well-studied phenotypic transition inC. albicansis filamentation, or hyphal/pseudohyphal formation, which can be induced by a variety of environmental conditions including temperature, pH, serum, elevated CO2and hypoxia [23,24,25]. The combination of filamentous and yeast form cells can also form biofilms, or multicellular communities, contributing to increased virulence and enhanced resistance to environmental insults. As such,C. albicans, particularly in community form, has been documented to have increased resistance to antifungal agents [4,26,27]. In short, this yeast is capable of altering its phenotype in a number of ways to become better suited for infection and the environmental cues responsible for initiating these transitions are numerous. Hallmarks of an infectious form ofC. albicansinclude robust growth, filamentation, biofilm production and resistance to antifungal agents. The studies included herein will focus on these yeast characteristics to determine whether microgravity represents an environmental cue with the potential to alter virulence. Due to limited access and the expense of spaceflight opportunities, ground-based simulators, such as rotating wall vessels or random positioning machines, have been used to generate a ‘modeled microgravity’ environment in order to predict the response of cells to spaceflight microgravity [28,29,30,31,32,33]. High Aspect Ratio Vessels (HARV) are rotating-wall vessels that, by revolving about an axis perpendicular to the gravitational vector, create a state of functional weightlessness and minimal fluid shear within the chamber. Low-fluid shear may indeed be an important environmental signal for organisms cultivated in microgravity. Reduced convection and diminished bulk flow may resulted in an altered cell-associated microenvironment through depletion of nutritional components and accumulation of waste products [34]. Interestingly, when cultivated in analog bioreactors or in the true microgravity environment, many, but not all, organisms display morphological and genetic changes consistent with increased virulence and invasive behavior [22,31,35,36,37,38]. Previous studies ofC. albicanscultured in HARV bioreactors demonstrated adaptations that included cells with increased filamentation, increased resistance to the antifungal agent AmB, altered colony morphology, and altered biofilm complexity [29,31]. The studies described herein focus on whether exposure ofC. albicansto true microgravity induces similar adaptation responses to those observed in ground-based analog studies, especially as they relate to the potential for increased virulence. Embedded in these studies are comparisons between spaceflight experiments and between two separate flight hardware systems. 2.1. Yeast Strain and Growth Conditions 2.2. Missions: Common Procedures Mission-specific timeline details for four separate experiments. ^ Transition to ISS crew and power resources; * Weather related unberth delay;#Late experiments not requested. Schematic representation of the hardware and experimental designs used in the mission payloads. (A) FPA bioreactors were used for the Micro-6/8 and Micro-14/FPA payloads and were loaded with two or three chambers, loaded in sequence, and separated by rubber septa. Medium was loaded in chamber A (2.7 mL in three chamber design, 5 mL in two chamber design) and cell inoculum was loaded in chamber B (0.5 mL). In the three chamber design, chamber C was loaded with 2.2 mL of fixative or fresh medium. Chambers were sequentially mixed on a predetermined schedule by depressing a plunger, and consequently the column of reagents and septa, to allow mixing of reagents through the bypass in the glass barrel. All eight FPAs within a GAP were processed as a unit. At the conclusion of the experimental operations, the FPAs were stored within the GAP at the prescribed temperature. (B) FEP bags were used for the Micro-14/FEP payload, allowing for dilution (D1and D2bags) and serial subculture procedures. To activate growth, yeast (1 mL, 4 × 104cells/mL) was injected into the first Large FEP bag (Bag A containing 11 mL YPD) and cultured for 24 h +/− 1 h at 30 °C. At the end of this growth stage, an aliquot was removed and diluted 20-fold (Bag AD1). From this dilution, the next Large FEP bag was inoculated (0.25 mL into Bag B containing 11.8 mL YPD) and cultured for 24 h +/− 1 h at 30 °C. This process was repeated until the cells had been cultured for five days (through Bag E). On each of the first four days, samples were also prepared to analyze antifungal sensitivity. For these samples, the dilution series was extended from the D1dilution bag to the D2dilution bag (1:10) and aliquots (0.2 mL) from D2were used to inoculate Small FEP bags (A1–A12, B1–B12, etc.) containing antifungal agents or control medium (2.8 mL). Each day following the 24 h growth period and any necessary sampling, FEP bags (Large FEP bags A–E, dilution D1bags A–D, and Small FEP antifungal bags) were frozen at <−80 °C for the remainder of the mission. (C) An overview is provided to summarize the experimental details for each payload. Cell inoculation, time of cultivation, relative time within the mission, and storage conditions are provided. In addition, the outcome measurements employed for each payload are indicated. Outcome measures that were performed/completed during flight with cells fixed in microgravity are indicated in black text. Outcome measures that were performed using cells returned viable (chilled or frozen) and processed post flight in the home laboratory are indicated in green text. 2.3. Mission-Specific Growth Conditions and Procedures 2.3.1. Micro-6 (and the Reflight Micro-8), Space X CRS-1 and -4, Respectively Temperature tracings comparing the experience of flight and terrestrial control samples throughout the duration of the missions. HOBO temperature sensors were incorporated into selected GAPs and retrieved during hardware de-integration at the end of the mission. (A) Samples in the Micro-6 payload that were activated early in the SpX CRS-1 mission, (B) Samples in the Micro-8 payload that were activated and then terminated late in the SpX CRS-4 mission, and (C) Samples in the Micro-14/FPA payload that were activated and ‘terminated’ with fresh medium late in the SpX CRS-16 mission for return of viable cells. Temperature sensors were not associated with FEP bag bioreactors in SpX CRS-17. Terrestrial control operations were performed near synchronously (2 h delay from flight) and for the purpose of this illustration the time offset was removed from the tracings to allow overlap of transitions for better comparison. Flight temperatures are traced in black, terrestrial control temperatures are traced in green, and key operations are indicated in text and highlighted with red vertical lines. 2.3.2. Micro-14/FPA, Space X CRS-16 2.3.3. Micro-14/FEP, Space X CRS-17 2.4.1. Cell Growth and Morphology Cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde (4%v/v, final) either in flight or immediately following hardware de-integration post flight. Direct manual cell counts were performed in duplicate using a Bright-Line hemocytometer (Sigma Aldrich) quantifying total cells as well as the contribution of cells with an extended morphology (filamentation; length greater than 2× the width of the cell) to the population. Samples were also stained with Calcofluor White (25 μM final, Molecular Probes) to stain chitin in the yeast cell wall and visualized using epifluorescence microscopy. Cell diameter and filament length were recorded using image collection on a Nikon Eclipse E-800 and interpreted using the software program Metamorph. Samples of non-fixed cultures were cultured post-flight on YPD agar plates as an indication of viability. Viability was calculated using colony forming units (CFU) with the actual/observed number of colonies compared to that expected based on cell counts. It is important to note that cell viability is likely to be higher than interpreted from the CFU analyses included in these studies due to the convention of our cell counting; budding cells are counted as two cells since that is how they will likely contribute to growth in planktonic cultures, whereas, these cells may remain associated during the plating process and give rise to a single colony. With this in mind, it should be understood that post-flight cell viability was quite high. 2.4.3. Antimicrobial Resistance For all data sets, means +/− standard deviations are shown. Determination of the difference between mean values for each data set was assessed by Studentt-test. Significance testing comparisons are described in the associated figure legends and are routinely provided as flight compared to terrestrial controls, antifungal agent to control, or between hardware types. Significance was established atpvalues <0.05, with more specificpvalues provided in the corresponding figure legends. 3.2. Sample Temperature Transitions throughout Mission Cell growth determination using direct cell counts at the end of each of the three missions. Cell growth was evaluated in the (A) Micro-6 (FPA), (B) Micro-14/FPA, and (C) Micro-14/FEP payloads. These analyses allowed mission-to-mission comparison using the same hardware (FPA comparison betweenA,B), as well as comparison using two different types of spaceflight hardware (A/B= FPAs versusC= FEP bags). ‘Low’ refers to the samples seeded with a low inoculum, ‘High’ refers to samples seeded with a high inoculum, ‘Early’ refers to samples activated near the beginning of the spaceflight mission, ‘Late’ refers to samples activated late in the spaceflight mission, and ‘viable’ refers to samples returned alive. Differential growth was not noted in the viable samples since flight cells were subjected to different transport temperatures than the terrestrial controls. Large FEP bags represent those with a final volume of 12 mL; small FEP bags represent those with a final volume of 3 mL. Black bars = flight; green bars = terrestrial controls. *p= 0.02; **p= 0.01. Generation time of yeast cells cultured in spaceflight and terrestrial control bioreactors. Passive seeding of biofilm communities on siliconized rubber membrane coupons. Siliconized rubber membrane coupons were included in the medium (chamber A) of selected FPAs in Micro-14/FPA and allowed to freely seed during the 24 h growth period of the experiment. Samples were fixed in microgravity and following sample return and hardware de-integration, the membranes were recovered and stained with Crystal Violet as an indicator of cells, cellular debris, and extracellular matrix. Stain that is retained on the membrane through a series of three water washing steps (wash 1, 2 and 3) and a final acetic acid wash (aa wash) is suggestive of a tighter integration of the cells with the substrate material. The stain removed by each wash was quantified by optical density at 595 nm. Black line = flight; green line = terrestrial control. 3.5. Cell Morphology and Filamentation Quantification of yeast filamentous cell morphology. Aliquots from each growth condition in the three payloads were fixed and retained at 4 °C for microscopic analyses. Some samples were fixed in microgravity, but for those samples returned frozen or viable, the aliquot was fixed immediately upon sample return to the home laboratory. (A) Filaments were quantified as a percentage of the total population. In this analysis, samples were aggregated by hardware, thus the FPA data represents samples cultured in YPD from the Micro-6 and Micro-14/FPA payloads. Similarly, the FEP data represents the aggregate from samples cultured in YPD in Large FEP bags and Small FEP bags from the Micro-14/FEP payload. *p< 0.003 for FPA vs. FEP. (B–E) Calcofluor White stained cells were visualized to evaluate cell morphology from Micro-14/FPA, scale bar = 35 μm; (B,C) are from terrestrial control samples and (D,E) are from flight samples. The arrows highlight key features in each of the images, including, (B) a cell with a bud scar, as indicated by a cell surface region with higher intensity staining and a second cell with a caliper measurement of 5.1 μm, (C) a caliper measured filament (142 μm) in which higher intensity staining also indicates intercellular septa (arrow), (D) cells in the process of budding (arrow), and (E) long filamentous cell demarcated with narrowed septal junctions (top arrow), a cell budding from the filament (middle arrow), and increased staining at septal junctions (bottom arrow). 3.6. Characteristics of C. albicans Cultured Post Flight Viability of yeast cells stored chilled or frozen. At the conclusion of the growth period during the mission, cells were chilled to 4 °C (A) Micro-6 and (B) Micro-14/FPA. Alternatively, cells were frozen at <−80 °C and transported to Earth at <−25 °C with (C) glycerol as a cryopreservation agent in Micro-14/FEP, Large FEP bags or (D) without glycerol in Micro-14/FEP, Small FEP bags. Following sample return and hardware de-integration, cells were immediately isolated, counted, diluted, and plated to quantify colony formation. Colonies were counted after 3 days of growth at 30 °C. Data is represented as the actual number of colonies relative to that expected based on cell counts. Panel A represents samples activated late in the mission (Late) with either the high inoculum (High) or low inoculum (Low), as previously described. Black bars = flight; green bars = terrestrial controls. *p< 0.03, **p= 0.003, flight vs. terrestrial. Colony morphology and size evaluated in yeast samples returned live. Following each mission, cells were isolated immediately following hardware de-integration, counted, diluted, and spread on YPD agar plates. Following 3 days of growth at 30 °C the plates were transferred to 4 °C pending analysis. (A–H) Individual colonies were imaged to evaluate colony architecture. (A,C,E,G) represent flight samples; (B,D,F) represent terrestrial controls;Hrepresents the HIW colonies produced after cultivation in the ground-based HARV bioreactor. Specifically, colonies are associated with the following payloads (A,B) Micro-6; (C,D) Micro 14/FPA, view of top of colony; (E,F) Micro 14/FPA, view of bottom of colony; (G) Micro-14/FEP and (H) HIW colony from HARV bioreactor as a morphology reference. Scale bars in panels (A,B) = 2.25 mm, (C–F) = 1 mm, (G,H) = 2 mm. (I) The diameter was measured on each of 15 colonies per plate for each payload. An aggregate of the data from all payloads was pooled and indicated as ‘All’. Black bars = flight; green bars = terrestrial controls. *p< 0.001, flight vs. terrestrial. 3.7. Susceptibility to Antifungal Agents C. albicanssusceptibility to antifungal agents. Micro-6 and Micro-14/FEP were designed to include analyses of the susceptibility of yeast to antifungal agents during cultivation in microgravity. Both payloads included amphotericin B (AmB) at concentrations previously determined to represent a functional range; the Micro-14/FEP payload also contained caspofungin (CAS) within a functional range. (A) Micro-6 samples were activated Early in the mission in the presence of 0.12 mg/L and 0.25 mg/L AmB and control conditions (YPD + DMSO), fixed at the end of the growth period, and cell counts performed upon return, (B) Untreated Micro-6 cells that were activated Late in the mission and returned viable were analyzed for antifungal sensitivity (AmB) at the conclusion of the mission using CFU analysis following drug exposure. Micro-14/FEP samples were cultured in the presence of (C) AmB at 0.12 mg/L, 0.25 mg/L, and 0.5 mg/L AmB and control conditions (YPD + DMSO) or (D) CAS at 0.01 mg/L, 0.025 mg/L and 0.1 mg/L CAS and control conditions, frozen on-orbit, and cell counts were completed following the mission. *p< 0.05, **p< 0.006, Flight vs. Terrestrial (A,B); treated vs. sham (C,D). Summary of data obtained across missions and in two types of hardware. * F = Flight; T = Terrestrial. Complex colony morphologies ofC. albicansare typically associated with an increase in filamented cells in the population [50]. Therefore, since complex macro-architectures were not observed in the studies herein, it is not surprising that cell filamentation was also found to be minimal. Interestingly, microarray studies published as part of the microgravity experiment conducted on STS-115 identified the upregulation of several genes associated with filamentous forms of the yeast, includingALS1,ALS4,YTH1,SPT5andSTI1. Other genes associated with filamentation were either downregulated or unchanged, namelyALS2,TEC1andALS2[35]. Of particular interest, the expression of form-associated genes was consistent with the observed low level of filamentation, specifically the gene coding for hyphal wall protein (HWP1) was unchanged in flight samples (−1.09) and yeast wall protein (YWP1) was elevated in flight samples (2.1). Current and ongoing studies will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of differential gene expression as related toC. albicanscultivation in microgravity. The complexity associated with spaceflight experiments and the challenges associated with them dictates the importance of determining whether, and to what extent, ground-based simulators can be predictive of cellular adaptation to the microgravity environment. As such, it is important for investigators to continue exploring biological systems in a variety of spaceflight hardware and to relate those studies to each other as well as ground-based simulators. Comprehensive analyses of these systems in space and on Earth will provide a guide for the predictability of ground-based models and a foundation for investigators to evaluate flight hardware.
