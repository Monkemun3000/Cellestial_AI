Primary root growth is required by the plant to anchor in the soil and reach out for nutrients and water, while dealing with obstacles. Efficient root elongation and bending depends upon the coordinated action of environmental sensing, signal transduction, and growth responses. The actin cytoskeleton is a highly plastic network that constitutes a point of integration for environmental stimuli and hormonal pathways. In this review, we present a detailed compilation highlighting the importance of the actin cytoskeleton during primary root growth and we describe how actin-binding proteins, plant hormones, and actin-disrupting drugs affect root growth and root actin. We also discuss the feedback loop between actin and root responses to light and gravity. Actin affects cell division and elongation through the control of its own organization. We remark upon the importance of longitudinally oriented actin bundles as a hallmark of cell elongation as well as the role of the actin cytoskeleton in protein trafficking and vacuolar reshaping during this process. The actin network is shaped by a plethora of actin-binding proteins; however, there is still a large gap in connecting the molecular function of these proteins with their developmental effects. Here, we summarize their function and known effects on primary root growth with a focus on their high level of specialization. Light and gravity are key factors that help us understand root growth directionality. The response of the root to gravity relies on hormonal, particularly auxin, homeostasis, and the actin cytoskeleton. Actin is necessary for the perception of the gravity stimulus via the repositioning of sedimenting statoliths, but it is also involved in mediating the growth response via the trafficking of auxin transporters and cell elongation. Furthermore, auxin and auxin analogs can affect the composition of the actin network, indicating a potential feedback loop. Light, in its turn, affects actin organization and hence, root growth, although its precise role remains largely unknown. Recently, fundamental studies with the latest techniques have given us more in-depth knowledge of the role and organization of actin in the coordination of root growth; however, there remains a lot to discover, especially in how actin organization helps cell shaping, and therefore root growth. Introduction: The Actin Cytoskeleton and Primary Root Growth The root system is an essential part of the plant that navigates the soil for water and nutrients. The primary root is the first organ to emerge from the seed, and therefore, its developmental plasticity is of utmost importance. The cytoskeleton is an interconnected filamentous network that is the key in controlling cell shape, rigidity, supports intracellular processes, and consists of microtubules and actin filaments (AF). AF consist of two helical strands of actin monomers that grow from the barbed plus end (compared to the pointed minus end) and rely on a plethora of actin-binding proteins to modify their organization and dynamics. Actin filaments are crucial for cell and tissue growth and participate in a large variety of processes including cell architecture and polarity establishment, signal transduction, cell-cell communication, cell division, and response to pathogens. Furthermore, the actin cytoskeleton is known to be an important player in vesicle trafficking, secretion, and endocytosis as well as endomembrane remodeling. By controlling the growth and division of cell, the actin cytoskeleton provides the means to dynamically respond to intracellular and extracellular stimuli (Mao et al., 2016;Zhu et al., 2016;Maeda et al., 2020) (Reviewed inPaez-Garcia et al., 2018;Li and Day, 2019;Takatsuka and Ito, 2020;Yang et al., 2020). The actin cytoskeleton responds to an extensive amount of stimuli, such as gravity, osmotic stress, pathogens, nutrients, and light (Henty-Ridilla et al., 2013;Leontovyčová et al., 2019) (Reviewed inLi and Day, 2019;Nakamura et al., 2019;Wang and Mao, 2019;Leontovyčová et al., 2020;Zhao et al., 2021). Plant hormones, and especially auxin, have strong effects on the composition of actin filaments (Arieti and Staiger, 2020; Reviewed inZhu and Geisler, 2015). The actin cytoskeleton has been studied extensively; however, the role that it plays in regulating the growth of the primary root is complex and often yields conflicting data. We hereby review how actin helps root growth. We first discuss how actin filaments organize during root growth. Then, we dissect how individual components of the actin filaments and the actin-binding proteins affect root growth. Next, we describe the evidence on how the hormones controlling growth affect the actin cytoskeleton and finally we discuss how actin affects the root tropisms to gravity and light. Actin Organization and Dynamics Correlate with Root Cell Elongation The main region that sustains primary root growth is the root apical meristem (RAM) through a tight balance between cell division and elongation (Ioio et al., 2008; Reviewed inTakatsuka and Umeda, 2014;Ötvös et al., 2021). The actin cytoskeleton has been connected to root growth through its participation mainly in cell expansion and, secondarily, cell division (Ingouff et al., 2005;Kandasamy et al., 2009;Takatsuka et al., 2018;Arieti and Staiger, 2020). Root meristem cells undergo two steps of rapid cell elongation. The first one occurs in the progression between the apical meristem and the transition zone (TZ), which is triggered by an endoreduplication event. A second fast elongation takes place in the boundary of the transition and elongation zones (EZ), characterized by an increase in vacuolar enlargement accompanied by cell wall loosening and new material deposition (Reviewed inVerbelen et al., 2006;Takatsuka and Umeda, 2014;Barrada et al., 2015). Actin cytoskeleton dynamics have often been connected to root cell elongation. Initial studies in the monocotZea mayspointed out specific actin arrangements depending on the cellular developmental stage in the longitudinal axis of the RAM. Immunolocalization revealed longitudinally oriented, often bundled, Filamentous actin (F-actin) in elongating cells while this disposition was lost during maturation (Baluška et al., 1997;Blancaflor and Hasenstein, 1997).

Cell growth has been proposed to be driven by a sequential coordination between cell wall modification and turgor pressure changes (Zimmermann et al., 1980). In this context, a turgor pressure increase is expected to raise the mechanical pressure on the cell wall, aiding cell elongation (Reviewed inKaiser and Scheuring, 2020). The actin cytoskeleton has been demonstrated to be key component of cell wall remodeling, mediating vesicle transport of cellulose synthase (CESA) complexes, cell wall modifying enzymes (e.g., expansins) or non-cellulosic cell wall components (Baluška et al., 2002;Leucci et al., 2006;Crowell et al., 2009;Sampathkumar et al., 2013). It is thought that the actin cytoskeleton transports vesicles containing cell wall modifying components that promote cell elongation. This hypothesis is supported by the negative effect of Latrunculin B-mediated actin depolymerization on the dynamics of CESA-containing Golgi bodies in roots or the decreased delivery and uptake of pectins and other polysaccharide components of the cell wall observed in other plant tissues (Baluška et al., 2002;Leucci et al., 2006;Sampathkumar et al., 2013). Conversely, plant cells treated with the cell wall inhibitor isoxaben or mutants with decreased cellulose content show altered F-actin distribution (Tolmie et al., 2017;Huang et al., 2020). In summary, longitudinally oriented actin bundles and increased actin dynamics are indicative of primary root cell elongation. Importantly, actin filaments seem to have a crucial role in the second rapid cell expansion of root cells. Why are these bundled and active filaments necessary for cell elongation in the root? Likely there are two important factors: First, actin filaments help to deliver cell wall remodeling components to the growing sides of the cell. There is a clear link between actin–myosin-mediated cytoplasmic streaming, endomembrane remodeling, and cell growth, suggesting that the organization of actin parallel to the growth axis could aid cell elongation by increasing delivery of endocytic cargoes (Peremyslov et al., 2012;Tominaga et al., 2013). Second, there is the plant-specific need to regulate a growing cells’ turgor pressure, which could be mediated by the vacuolar network. Root cell elongation is inversely correlated to vacuolar constriction and the two are tightly depending on specific actin organization and dynamics. However, the connection between vacuolar occupancy, actin, and root growth should be explored in more detail. The Role of Actin Isoforms and Actin-Binding Proteins in Primary Root Growth The actin cytoskeleton consists of actin filaments made up of strands of G-actin polymers of different isoforms, depending on the cell type, tissue, or specific cellular function. Proteins that bind to, interact with, and modify actin filaments to coordinate their orientation and dynamics, are crucial for the operation of the actin cytoskeleton. Actin nucleators promotede novoor branched filament assembly; actin-capping/severing proteins regulate the dynamics of actin filaments by mediating its turnover; network protein (NET) family members link actin and the endomembrane system; myosin motor proteins facilitate actin-based vesicle and organ motility. In the next section, we dissect which particular isoforms of actin are crucial for root growth and we discuss how and why various actin-binding proteins affect root growth. Actin and actin-binding protein role in primary root growth. TZ, transition zone; and EZ, elongation zone. Actin Nucleators and Actin Crosslinker/Bundling Proteins Actin-Capping/Severing Proteins ADF/cofilins are a family of actin-binding proteins that promote depolymerization, severing and bundling of actin filaments. There are 11 ADF genes that can be divided into two subfamilies: D-type ADFs with depolymerizing activities (ADF1-4, ADF6-8, and ADF10-11) and B-type ADFs with bundling activity (ADF5 and ADF9;Nan et al., 2017). Expression analysis of the members of this family has shown that all ADFs exceptADF7andADF10are expressed in root tissues of whichADF1,ADF5, andADF6in the vasculature,ADF5andADF9in the RAM andADF8andADF11in trichoblasts (Dong et al., 2001a;Kandasamy et al., 2007;Ruzicka et al., 2007).ADF1overexpression induced shorter roots, consistent with the phenotype observed when plants are treated with actin-depolymerizing drugs such as Latrunculin B. In contrast, reduced expression ofADF1resulted in longer roots. Research in hypocotyls showed an increase of actin bundling in mutants with decreasedADF1expression (Dong et al., 2001b).ADF2-RNAilines show increased actin density and bundling in roots but no visible root phenotype other than an occasional reduction in root apical meristem size, similar to the effect obtained with the actin-stabilizing drug Jasplakinolide (Clément et al., 2009). Once more,ADFgenetic redundancy may be the key to the lack of observable root phenotypes in knockout mutants, but the increase in actin bundling and density in the respective mutants suggests that ADF1 and ADF2 specifically are involved in increasing actin turnover in root epidermis. This is a hint of their function in root elongation; however, more research is needed to uncover the importance of other ADFs in this process. ACTIN INTERACTING PROTEIN 1 (AIP1) is facilitating the activity of ADF/cofilin proteins and has a function in capping the barbed end of actin filaments (Ketelaar et al., 2004). Consistent with the effect observed by drugs like Cytochalasin D,AIP1-RNAilines show reduced root growth accompanied by a general increase in actin bundling (Ketelaar et al., 2004). Downregulation ofAIP1expression leads to reduced FM4-64 internalization comparable to the effect observed after Jasplakinolide treatment. The phenotype observed is possibly a consequence of actin filament stabilization (Dhonukshe et al., 2008). Profilins regulate the pool of available G-actin to inhibitde novopolymerization and the addition of new monomers to existing filaments; they also contribute to depolymerization and monomer recycling (Michelot et al., 2005; Reviewed inBlanchoin et al., 2010). Profilins belong to a multigene family and can be divided into two main groups: vegetative (PRF1–PRF3) and reproductive (PRF4 and PRF5;Kandasamy et al., 2002). The vegetative profilin genePRF1has higher promoter activity in the elongation zone (Ramachandran et al., 2000). Analysis ofprf1knockout lines resulted in contradicting root length phenotypes that overall indicate a role for PRF1 in regulating root growth (Ramachandran et al., 2000;McKinney et al., 2001;Müssar et al., 2015;Cao et al., 2016). Theprf3mutant has no observable root growth phenotype and overexpression of PRF3 induces either WT-like or shorter roots (Fan et al., 2013;Müssar et al., 2015). PRF1 was shown to maintain actin filament density in elongation zone root epidermal cells (Cao et al., 2016). Analysis of actin dynamics in hypocotyl cells suggests a role of PRF1 in the positive regulation of actin turnover through the facilitation of nucleation of other actin pools through formin activity (Cao et al., 2016). Though, it is likely that different profilins regulate the dynamics of distinct pools of actin, therefore producing different phenotypes. Actin-Membrane Binding Proteins Hormonal Regulation of Actin-Mediated Primary Root Growth Primary root growth plasticity depends on the very tight balance between cell division, cell elongation, and cell differentiation. The rapid adjustment to new stimuli is mediated by the coordinated action of a complex network of plant hormones. However, as the previous sections showed, the actin cytoskeleton also plays an important role here. Often hormones lead to changes in actin, and actin changes lead to differences in hormone distribution. In this section, we focus on the role of the actin cytoskeleton in hormonal control of primary root growth, and especially the role of auxin, the most-studied hormone in this context. The Auxin-Actin Feedback Loop Modulates Root Development It appears that auxin and actin are very much interlinked via the control of polar auxin transport by actin dynamics, or via the direct or transcriptional effects of auxin on the same actin dynamics. Exactly how these two important players feedback on each other and create coordinated development and tropisms is still a topic with many questions. Especially interesting is the mechanistic connection between the intracellular transport of vesicles containing auxin transporters and the status of the actin network, or the way in which auxin sensing is quickly translated into changes in the actin network. Actin Control of Primary Root Tropisms and Light Response Root plasticity relies on the ability of the root to direct its growth toward or against a stimulus. For the primary root tip this is achieved mostly through asymmetric cell expansion that allows for its bending. Mainly two tropisms have been studied in relation to actin: positive gravitropism and negative phototropism. In both cases actin is involved in both stimuli perception and response. Effects of Light on Actin Organization in Roots Concluding Remarks and Future Perspective Knowledge in this field is lacking evidence on the role of actin-binding proteins in regulating the actin network with regard to growth and development of the root meristem. In general, actin-binding proteins are well studied, however, with respect to root growth, there is little data available on phenotypic effects, usually due to a high degree of genetic redundancy. Overexpression often leads to detrimental effects on root growth, while single or even double mutants do not. With recent advances in CRISPR multiplexing, this redundancy problem can be tackled efficiently and the roles of actin-binding proteins in root growth and development can and should be elucidated. Hormonal regulation of primary root growth occurs mainly through the coordination between auxin and cytokinin signaling, which contributes to the generation of developmental regions with a specific actin organization. The role of auxins, cytokinins, and especially other hormones in the control of the actin cytoskeleton requires more future work. This work would be made easier by the consistent and more precise denomination of which root zones and cell layers are analyzed, in order to compare the effects of individual hormones and their combination in the control of the actin network. Related to this is the study of root gravitropism, where actin has several different functions. It is involved in the direct sensing of gravity, controls the propagation of the hormone signal and it is likely involved in the subsequent regulation of cell elongation. This study brings together three different roles for actin and is therefore a very interesting subfield, which will benefit by recent advances in live imaging. With vertically oriented confocal laser scanning microscopes it is possible to study root gravitropismin vivoin real time and see details and subtleties not imaged before. Another new way of studying actin will be to use new optogenetic tools that allow the direct manipulation of the cytoskeleton or cytoskeletal components (Zhang et al., 2021), which might provide a deeper understanding of how actin functions in regulating cell elongation in complex tissues such as the root. With these new possibilities it will be possible to subtly disturb the actin network while imaging it at the highest temporal and spatial resolution.
