The central nervous system (CNS) is vulnerable to irradiation [1] and fluid shifts [2] experienced during short- and long-term spaceflight. An important goal for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is to identify the effects of spaceflight-like conditions on the CNS to better prepare astronauts during long-duration missions to the Moon and Mars. During missions beyond low-earth orbit (LEO), astronauts will be continuously exposed to low-dose ionizing radiation (LDR). While high linear energy transfer (LET) galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) and low LET solar particle event (SPE) radiation contribute large portions of the radiation dose accumulated by astronaut crew members [3], interactions between GCR and SPE particles and spacecraft release secondary radiation including γ-rays that can deliver a significant fraction of the total mission does [4]. In addition, altered gravity (hypergravity experienced at launch/landing and microgravity experienced in-flight) affects homeostatic fluid-shifting in the CNS. Studies examining readaptation to Earth’s gravity are of equal importance, as recovery from spaceflight exposure may require medical intervention, in particular within organs known to be sensitive to irradiation and fluid shifts. Astronauts in spaceflight experience impairments in neurocognition (as measured by altered decision making and problem solving) and neurobehavior (as measured by impaired visual perceptions, motor controls and sleep–wake cycles) [5]. The NASA Twins study offers some additional insight into post-flight cognitive decline that persists up to 6 months post-flight (end of experimental sampling) [6]. Longitudinal diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data collected from astronauts pre- and post-flight (shuttle missions <30 days and ISS mission <200 days) revealed whole brain shifting within the skull and white matter disruptions, suggesting spaceflight leads to long-term alterations of brain structure in humans [7]. Rodent models offer an appropriate alternative to assess the effects of spaceflight-like conditions on brain tissue. Recently, the Rodent Research (RR)-1 mission flew mice to the International Space Station (ISS) for 33 days and measured neurobehavioral outcomes through video monitoring, which indicated 16-week old (at launch) females displayed unique group hyperactivity behavior at 2 weeks post-launch, implying neurological disruptions occur in flight [8]. Moreover, long-term readaptation to chronic LDR and hindlimb unloading (HLU) (a ground-based analog of spaceflight) resulted in increased aquaporin-4 (AQP4) protein expression, oxidative stress damage, apoptosis, blood–brain barrier (BBB) compromise and an increase in neurobehavioral risk-taking behavior [9,10,11]. The effects of acute radiation doses on the CNS have been well documented [12]. However, responses to chronic LDR exposure, as encountered on space missions (<0.04 Gy/y), are not well investigated [13], particularly in a pan-transcriptome context. Moreover, long-term readaptive outcomes on neurohealth following spaceflight-like conditions are less studied. Due to the need to better understand the transcriptional changes associated with chronic LDR in combination with reduced gravity (unloading) on neurohealth, mice were exposed to chronic LDR γ-ray irradiation (0.04 Gy), HLU, or a combination of HLU+LDR for 21 days, followed by a 4-month readaptation period. Whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-seq) data were analyzed for differentially expressed genes (DEG), while data from reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) were analyzed to determine differentially methylated promoters (DMP) [14]. Overall, we found minimal gene alterations at 4 months of readaptation within single treatment conditions of HLU or LDR, namely, in pathways related to the reduced expression of translational machinery, while the combination of HLU+LDR resulted in a wide panel of altered DEG and DMP profiles for tight junctions, aquaporins, neurogenesis markers and neuropeptides. Therefore, exposure to spaceflight-like conditions may lead to mild, long-term neurological consequences, while readaptation is an active process involving neuroplasticity and repair that is cooperatively engaged post-HLU+LDR exposure to maintain neural homeostasis. 2.1. Experimental Design and Mouse Body Weights Across Experimental and Readaptation Timepoints Experimental timeline and body weights during- and post-hindlimb unloading (HLU), low-dose irradiation (LDR) or combined HLU+LDR. (A) Whole brains were isolated from C57BL/6J at 4 months post-experimental conditions of hindlimb unloading (HLU, 21 days), low-dose irradiation (LDR, 0.04 Gy for 21 days) or combined LDR and HLU timeline. (B) Body weights were monitored throughout the experiment (21 days) and during readaptation (4 months post-experimental exposure). Baseline weights were taken on day 0, prior to the initiation of HLU and LDR exposure. An unpairedt-test with Welch’s correction compared experimental groups with controls. A * denotes significance of HLU only compared to controls at the 7-day timepoint. Error bars denote standard error of means. Dashed gray arrows highlight start and endpoints of experimental LDR and HLU treatments, and the final timepoint of the experiment when tissue was collected for transcriptomic analysis.

LDR, HLU and Combined HLU+LDR Exposures Displayed Minimal Gene and Promoter Methylation Overlap at 4 Months Readaptation Gene list of overlapping differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially methylated promoters (DMPs) within each post-exposure condition. Minimal brain differential gene expression and promoter methylation overlap across different simulated spaceflight experimental conditions. Gene lists of DEGs and the genes corresponding to the differentially methylated promoters (DMPs) were created for each condition: LDR, HLU, or HLU+LDR combined versus controls. The dotted region depicts all conditions, and the connecting lines depict DEG/DMP overlap between experimental conditions. The vertical bars indicate the size of that overlap. A single, grey dot indicates the number of DEG/DMP that do not overlap with any other DEG/DMP. The red dots indicate DMP overlap across different conditions. The blue dots indicate DEG overlap across different conditions. The black dots indicate DEG and DMP overlap. “Upregulated/downregulated” denotes gene expression of DEG and “hypermethylated/hypomethylated” denotes methylation patterns of DMPs. 2.3. Readaptation at 4 Months Following Exposure to Combined HLU+LDR Involves Gene Expression Changes in Multiple Brain-Associated Pathways Altered biological processes and pathways identified at 4 months post-combined HLU+LDR exposure. (A,B) WebGestalt graphs depict enriched gene ontology (GO) terms for downregulated (A) and upregulated (B) DEGs. The x-axis measures the enrichment ratio for each GO term on a Log2scale. The y-axis measures -Log10(false discovery rate, FDR). The size and color tone of the dot is proportional to the size of the category. The displayed categories are from WebGestalt’s “Weighted set cover” option, which displays the GO categories that minimize redundancy. Combination of LDR and HLU versus controls DEG and Reactome pathway IDs in mice that translated to human orthologs. Herein, we identified that chronic exposure (21 days) to single or combined HLU and LDR resulted in long-term transcriptional alterations in CNS brain tissue in female mice at 4 months post-exposure. The gene expression changes observed here imply reduced transcriptional machinery, increased neurogenesis and neuropeptide production, and dysregulated cell structure and cell signaling. These studies offer translational value into pathways regulated in humans, as gene ontology analyses identified similar genetic overlap between mice and human profiles, in particular in pathways involved in neurodevelopmental homeostasis and signal transduction. Collectively, brain-related transcriptional changes that are dynamic in readaptation from exposure to spaceflight-like conditions may lead to long-term neurological consequences. Indeed, 21 days of exposure to combined HLU+LDR did not result in immediate neurobehavioral deficits (1 week post-exposure); however, increased risk-taking behavior was observed at 9 months post-exposure [9], indicating delayed neurological impairments in a combination of HLU+LDR, that was not apparent in HLU or LDR only. Brain structural damage through disruption of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) is associated with neurodegeneration and subsequent behavioral dysfunctions [18]. Our previous study showed that aquaporin-4 (AQP4), a water-channel protein involved in brain water homeostasis, was up-regulated following combined exposure to irradiation and unloading [9], suggesting a disturbance in BBB integrity may lead to edema [19]. Furthermore, AQP4 induction was seen in concert with subtle behavioral changes at 9 months post-exposure [9], indicating a potential role for BBB dysfunction and neurobehavioral consequences. AlthoughAqp4was not identified in this study,Aqp1gene expression was induced following combination of HLU+LDR at 4 months readaptation, suggesting similar BBB disturbances and possible shifts in brain water homeostasis [19]. In line with this, the induction of aquaporins may be linked to neuroinflammation [20,21,22], while the upregulation of additional immune activation markers includingCd74,H2-Ab1, C1ql2andIfit-3were also identified in combination HLU+LDR at 4 months readaptation, along with hypomethylatedCfi and Mx1, collectively suggesting chronic neuroinflammation may persist during brain readaptation post-combined HLU+LDR exposure. Tight junctions, including claudins, connexins, and occludins contribute to BBB permeability and maintenance. A reduction in these molecules has been implicated in acute BBB disruption in neuroviral [26] and neuroinflammatory diseases [27]. In line with this,Cdh12was downregulated, whereas,Cldn2was induced in combination of HLU+LDR. Furthermore,Cdhr4was hypomethylated in both LDR alone and HLU+LDR at 4 months readaptation, whileCdhr2was hypomethylated in LDR and HLU alone, but not in combination HLU+LDR at 4 months readaptation, suggesting BBB restructuring, and further indicating the dynamic process of brain physiology during readaptation. Adult neurogenesis is a process of neural and glia self-renewal and the generation of progenitor cells from radial glial cells (RGCs) within the subventricular and subgranular zones of the hippocampus [28]. RGCs are quiescent and are activated to initiate neurogenesis in response to a stimulus [29], such as LDR [17,30] or models of increased intracranial pressure [31,32]. Indeed, the majority of highly upregulated DEGs post-combination HLU+LDR were involved in HPA signaling, neuropeptide growth factors, and neurogenesis, i.e.,Otp,Uncx,Ucn3,Avp,Pmch,Prox1,Calb2,Tbr-1, andHcrt. While the magnitude of gene expression does not always result in observable phenotypes, these notable DEGs may serve an important purpose in neuromaintenance during readaptation. Interestingly,Crh, a stress-induced hormone, was hypermethylated post-exposure to LDR and combination HLU+LDR at 4 months readaptation, implying transcriptional silencing ofCrhmay be engaged to suppress robust HPA activity during readaptation, which warrants further studies. In summary, a multitude of neurological effects and persistent brain transcriptional alterations were observed at 4 months post-HLU+LDR in 21-day exposures. Changes included reduced transcriptional machinery, increased neurogenesis and neuropeptide production, and dysregulated cell structure and signaling genes. Thus, brain-related transcriptional changes are dynamic and plastic during readaptation from exposure to spaceflight-like conditions, and while these exposures may lead to long-term neurological consequences, the active processes of neuroplasticity and repair are engaged to maintain neural homeostasis. Six-month-old, femaleC57BL/6Jmice (Jackson Laboratory), as previously reported [10], were utilized in this report. Upon arrival, they were acclimatized for 7 days in standard habitats at 20 °C with a 12 h:12 h light:dark cycle. Commercial pellet chow and hydrogel were available ad libitum. Animal health status, water and food intake were monitored daily. The study followed recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals [36] and was approved on April 30, 2014, by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Loma Linda University (Protocol number 8130028). Following acclimatization, animals were housed one per cage and assigned to one of four groups: (1) control (n= 3); (2) hindlimb unloaded (HLU) (n= 6); (3) low-dose irradiated (LDR) (n= 6); and (4) combination hindlimb unloaded and low-dose irradiated (HLU+LDR) (n= 4) for 21 days. Post-experimental exposure animals were group housed (3 per cage) for up to 4 months (4M). 4.3. Hindlimb Unloading and Whole-Body Irradiation Hindlimb-unloaded animals (HLU) were treated as previously described [37], with animals maintained at a 35–40 head-down tilt with the hindlimbs elevated above the bottom of the cage. LDR gamma irradiation was performed by placing57Co plates (185 MBq activity; GPI, Stoughton, WI) under the cages (1 plate per 2 cages). These cobalt plates deliver chronic low-dose/low-dose-rate γ-ray irradiation. A total dose of 0.04 Gy was delivered at a rate of 0.01 cGy/h over 21 days. HLU+LDR animals were both unloaded and irradiated as described here. Control animals received no treatment. All animals were handled similarly. 4.4. Euthanasia, Dissection, Tissue Storage, and Nucleic Acid Extraction Mice were euthanized with 100% CO2followed by immediate exsanguination by cardiac puncture. Immediately after euthanasia brains were removed and bisected along the midline and coronally within the half hemispheres, with the brainstem and cerebellum removed. The right caudal half hemisphere of the brain (containing mid- and hindbrain) from each mouse was placed in a sterile cryovial, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at −80 °C. AllPrep DNA/RNA/miRNA Universal Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was used to extract RNA and DNA according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Tissue homogenization was performed using the Tissue homogenizing CKMix (Bertin Instruments, Montigny-le-Bretonneux, France) on a Minilys homogenizer (Bertin Instruments). RNA and DNA concentrations were measured using a Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and stored at −80 °C. The Ovation Mouse RNA-Seq System 1–96 (NuGEN Technologies, Redwood City, CA, USA) was used per manufacturer’s instructions to construct RNA-Seq libraries. A total of 100 ng of total RNA was used as input. First and second strands of cDNA were synthesized from total RNA spiked with 1 µL of 1:500 diluted ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In Mix 1 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) at the appropriate ratio. Following primer annealing and cDNA synthesis, the products were sheared using Covaris S220 Focused-ultrasonicator (Covaris Inc., Woburn, MA, USA) to obtain fragment sizes between 150–200 bp. This was followed by end-repair, adaptor index ligation and strand selection. Barcodes with unique indices out of 96 indices, were used per sample for multiplexing. Strand selection was performed using a custom InDA-C primer mixture SS5 Version5 for mice (NuGEN Technologies). Libraries were amplified by PCR with 17 cycles on a Mastercycler Pro (Eppendorf) and purified with RNAClean XP Agencourt beads (Beckman Coulter, Pasadena, CA, USA). These libraries were sequenced on a HiSeq 4000 (Illumina, Mira Loma, CA, USA) to generate 15–30 M 75-bp single end reads per sample. Raw data are available at NASA GeneLab (genelab.nasa.gov, accession GLDS-202) [14]. 4.6. Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS) The RRBS library was constructed with 100 ng of gDNA as input using Ovation RRBS Methyl-Seq System (NuGEN Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, MspI enzyme, which cuts the DNA at CCGG sites, was used to digest gDNA into fragments. The fragments were directly subject to end blunting and phosphorylation followed by ligation to a methylated adapter with a single-base T overhang. The ligation products were finally repaired in a thermal cycler under the program (60 °C for 10 min, 70 °C for 10 min, held at 4 °C). The product of the final repair reaction was used for bisulfite conversion using the EpiTect Fast DNA Bisulfite Kit (Qiagen). Bisulfite-converted DNA was then amplified on a Mastercycler Pro (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) and bead-purified with Agencourt RNAClean XP Beads (Beckman Coulter). The RRBS libraries were sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 4000 at Loma Linda Center for Genomics to generate 15–55 M 70-bp single end reads per sample. Raw data are available at NASA GeneLab (genelab.nasa.gov, accession GLDS-202) [14]. 4.7. Differential Expression and Pathway Enrichment Analysis 4.8. Differential Methylation Analysis Sequencing reads were first trimmed with Cutadapt [38] using the Trim Galore! wrapper using the “--RRBS” flag before processing with the “bismark” and “bismark_methylation_extractor” scripts from Bismark [45]. The differential methylation of gene bodies and promoters was performed with RnBeads version 1.10.8 and R version 3.4.1 (R Foundation, Boston, MA, USA) [46]. The combined ranking score was utilized to detect differential methylation. It combines absolute and relative effect sizes as well asp-values from statistical modeling into a single score.
