  "content": "Three Routes to Modulate the Pore Size of the MscL Channel/Nanovalve Correspondence: 5323 Harry Hines Blvd., Dallas, TX 75390, USA.paul.blount@utsouthwestern.edu MscL is a bacterial mechanosensitive channel that protects cells from lysis upon acute decrease in external osmotic environment. It is one of the best characterized mechanosensors known, thus serving as a paradigm of how such molecules sense and respond to stimuli. In addition, the fact that it can be genetically modified, expressed, isolated, and manipulated has led to its proposed use as a triggered nanovalve for various functions including sensors within microelectronic array chips, as well as vesicular-based targeted drug release. X-ray crystallography reveals a homo-pentameric complex with each subunit containing two transmembrane α-helices (TM1 and TM2) and a single carboxyl terminal α-helix arranging within the complex to form a five-fold cytoplasmic bundle (CB), whose function and stability remain unclear. In this study, we show three routes that throttle the open channel conductance. When the linker between the TM2 and CB domain is shortened by deletions or constrained by either cross linking or heavy metal coordination, the conductance of the channel is reduced; in later two cases, even reversibly. While having implications for the stability of the CB, these data also provide routes for engineering MscL sensors that are more versatile for potential nanotech devices. The mechanosensitive channel of large conductance, MscL, is a bacterial channel located in the cytoplasmic membrane that protects cells from lysis upon acute decrease in external osmotic environment by releasing cytoplasmic osmolytes.1This channel was first identified inE. coli, and most functional studies have been undertaken in this species. A MscL homologue fromMycobacterium tuberculosis, which has 67% similarity, has been resolved by X-ray crystallography and shown to be a homopentamer, with each subunit containing two transmembrane α helices (TM1 and TM2), of which TM1 forms the pore of the channel and TM2 is exposed to the lipid bilayer.2Although a more recent crystal structure of MscL fromS. aureusshows a tetrameric complex,3this appears to be a detergent-specific oligomeric organization not reflecting a physiological state;in vivoessentially all channels are pentameric.4–5The pentameric channel opens by the expansion of both TM1 and TM2 in response to tension in cell membrane.6–11The channel also contains a single carboxyl terminal α helix from each subunit that together assemble into a 5-helix cytoplasmic bundle (CB).2It remains unclear what the function of the CB is, and whether or to what extent the bundle is dissociated during channel gating. Previous studies have shown that theE. coliMscL channel has a very large pore size, greater than 30Å,12which has caused some researchers to speculate that it could be used in nanodevices. Indeed, it has many properties that would make it ideal for use as a triggered nanovalve in such devices. It can be translatedin vitro13or synthetically synthesized, reconstituted into lipids, and yet spontaneously assemble into a functional complex.14Since introduction of charges into the channel pore lumen can gate the channel in the absence of membrane tension,7,15–18E. coliMscL has been engineered into controllable nanovalves that detect alternative modalities including light19and pH.20The channel has been shown to be functional in vesicular-release devices,19–21as well as in an engineered microelectronic array chip;22its large pore size yields a robust response in such devices. However, for some purposes a smaller or adjustable pore size would be of advantage. The data presented within this study onE. coliMscL have two aspects: first, they resolve the issue of whether the CB disassociates upon normal channel opening, and second, they demonstrate that the MscL nanopore response can be effectively and reversibly modulated, which would have advantages in an assortment of potential nanodevices. Disassociation of the c-terminal α helical bundle is not required for normal gating and conductance of the MscL channel In vivocross linking of cytoplasmic terminal bundle (CB) of MscL L121-122C/L128-129C mutant. a. The side view of X-ray crystal structure of MscL fromMycobacterium tuberculosis(PDB code 2OAR). A single subunit of MscL channel is shown on the left and is also highlighted as dark gray in a homopentameric channel (right). Each subunit contains two transmembrane α-helices (TM1 and TM2) and one cytoplasmic α-helix, which assemble into a five-fold cytoplasmic terminal bundle (CB). In the middle of the cytoplasmic linker, the equivalent amino acids of E. coli (A110-115) that were either mutated or deleted for this study are shown, as well as the location of the mutated leucines within the bundle. Note that theE. coli128 and 129L are not observed in the M. tuberculosis structure. b. Western blot showing that disulfide bridges of a MscL tetra cysteine mutant (L121-122C/L128-129C) lead to cross linking of channel subunits. Before loading with non-reducing Laemmli sample buffer, cells expressing MscL L121-122C/L128-129C mutant were grown in high osmolarity (lane 1), some of which were then osmoticaly downshocked (lane 2), or osmoticaly downshocked in the presence of Cu-phenanthroline (lane 3), with the latest having a ladder of monomer through pentamer (1X–5X) formed by disulfide bridging between different subunits of the complex. The CB was originally revealed in the crystal structure of theM. tuberculosisMscL,2but it adopted what appeared to be a non-stable confirmation with negatively charged residues facing each other. Subsequently, Anishkinet al. proposed a more stable conformation for the CB based on the crystal structure of the pentameric cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), which has a consensus motif, ALQDVRELLR, similar to that of the MscL CB, LLxEIRDLLK.23The COMP crystal structure showed a strongly amphipathic helix in which all apolar residues are packed inside the fivefold bundle. In an attempt to address the correctness and the stability of this proposed structure for the CB, Anishkinet al. mutated the pairs of leucines predicted to face each other to cysteines within the consensus motif; these formed cross bridges between subunits, as anticipated from the authors’ proposed structure, yet normal channel activity was observed.23The authors interpreted these data as suggesting not only that their proposed structure was correct, but that the CB remained intact upon gating. Subsequently, a re-evaluation of the MscL crystal structure24confirmed the more stable conformation of the CB. However, a site-directed spin labeling study onE. coliMscL revealed a significant difference in the structure of the end of TM2, which was explained by several possibilities, including that the c-terminus of each channel subunit might not assemble into CB but, instead, fold toward the membrane interface establishing specific tertiary contacts with TM2.25In addition, a more recent study using atomic force microscopy noted that the bundle appeared to be missing in a spontaneously opened MscL mutant, suggesting that the CB was not as stable as predicted and did indeed disassociate upon gating.26In critically evaluating the Anishkinet al. study, we noted that the patch clamp traces were obtained at threshold- rather than saturating-stimulus conditions. But patch clamp is exquisitely sensitive, detecting single molecular events, while the cysteine crosslinking at these sites is extremely inefficient. It therefore seemed possible that the activities observed in the Anishkin study could simply be the channels that contained little or no crosslinking. Deletions within the TM2/CB linker lead to channels with decreased conductance Summary of single channel current and mechanosensitivity of MscL channels tested in this paper with the different experiments organized into four groups as marked in red. p< 0.001 byttext when compared with wild type (WT) MscL, G22C (group 2), or the corresponding controls (groups 3 and 4). Deletions in TM2/CB linker of MscL decrease its current. “O” and “C” refer to full opening and closing of the channel, respectively. Pressure applied to patch pipette is shown in mmHg. As shown, compared with single channel current of wild type MscL (WT), MscL with 110–112 deletion (Δ110-112) has slightly decreased current and the current of the MscL with the 110–115 deletion (Δ110-115) is further reduced and has a short open time, or ‘flickery’ behavior. All point histogram of the TM2/CB linker deletions. As shown, the single channel current of wild type MscL (WT) is 87pA, while that of MscL Δ110-112 is decreased to 73pA. Due to the short open times observed for MscL Δ110-115, the peak opening currents could not easily be measured, but most of the channel openings are below 30 pA Engineering a triggered nanovalve with a smaller pore size Engineering and testing of a MscL nanovalve with a decreased pore size. a. Patch clamp recordings show the spontaneous single channel opening of G22C (left) and G22C/Δ110-115 (right) after MTSET+treatment. “O1” and “C” refer to main opening and closing of the channel, respectively, and “O2” refers to a higher level opening of the channel; note that no pressure was needed to gate either channel. b. Percentage calcein release from vesicles reconstituted with G22C (black line), G22C/Δ110-115 (red line) or without MscL protein (gray line). The dashed lines show the standard derivation of fluorescence signal from three independent experiments. The arrows indicate addition of MTSET+, followed by Triton X-100 detergent to measure the 100% calcein content. Disulfide crosslinking of the TM2/CB linker decreases channel conductance Cysteine cross linking decreases MscL A110-112 current. a. Western blot showing that disulfide bridges of a MscL triple cysteine mutant (A110-112C) lead to cross linking of channel subunits. Before loading with non-reducing Laemmli sample buffer, cells expressing MscL A110-112C mutant were grown in high osmolarity (lane 1), some of which were then osmoticaly downshocked (lane 2), or treated with oxidizing agent Cu-phenanthroline (lane 3), or osmoticaly downshocked in the presence of Cu-phenanthroline (lane 4). A ladder of monomer through pentamer (1X–5X) is formed by cross linking between different subunits. As shown, shock plus Cu-phenanthroline treatment leads to the most pronounced formation of cross-linking among channel subunits. b. Change in the current of MscL A110-112C mutant before and after DTT treatment. Data were pooled from 15 patch clamp recordings. *** p < 0.001 by two tailed and paired t test. c. One representative patch clamp recording of single channel opening of MscL A110-112C before (left) and after (Right) DTT treatment, which serves as a reducing agent to break the disulfide bridges formed between two cysteines. “O” and “C” refer to full opening and closing of the channel, respectively. Pressure applied to patch pipette is shown in mmHg. Bundling the TM2/CB linker by engineering a heavy metal binding site within it allows for the reversible decrease in channel conductance Currents of MscL single histidine mutants (A110H and A112H) are decreased by ZnCl2. a. Patch clamp recordings of MscL mutants A110H and A112H. “O” and “C” refer to full opening and closing of the channel, respectively, and “S” refers to low level opening or substance of the channel. As shown, the current is decreased by ZnCl2treatment in the bath solution, and is reversed to the control level by washing out the ZnCl2. Pressure applied to patch pipette is shown in mmHg. B. The all point histogram analyses, reflecting the decrease in conductance of MscL A110H and A112H by ZnCl2treatment. Implications for nanotech-devices TheE. coliMscL mutants were generated using the Mega Primer method as described previously.35Mutants were inserted within the pB10b or pB10d expression construct, a modified pB10b plasmid.27,36–37E. colistrain PB104 (ΔmscL:Cm)36was used forin vivoassays and electrophysiological analysis. Cultures were routinely grown in Lennox Broth (LB) medium (Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, NY, USA) plus ampicillin (100μg/ml) in a shaker-incubator at 37°C and rotated at 250 cycles/min. Expression was induced by addition of 1 mM isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) (Anatrace Inc, Maumee, OH, USA). Overnight cultures were diluted 1:100 and grown 1 h at 37°C in LB. LB with 1 M NaCl was then added for a final concentration of 0.5 M. Cultures were then induced with 1 mM IPTG for 1 h when an OD 600 of 0.2 was reached. Cultures were either Mock shocked (0.5 M NaCl in LB media) or shocked in water (with or without 15 μM Cu-phenanthroline) at a 1:20 dilution for 20 min at 37°C. Samples were pelleted at 4,000 g for 20 min and immediately re-suspended in non-reducing sample buffer, adjusted for final OD, and run on a 4%–20% gel (Bio-Rad) for Western blot analysis.30,38The primary antibody anti-Penta His (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) was used at 1:2,000 and the secondary Goat anti-Mouse HRP (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) at 1:40,000. Blots were developed using HRP substrate (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and exposed to film. E. coligiant spheroplasts were generated and used in patch-clamp experiments as described previously.38–39Excised, inside-out patches were examined at room temperature under a membrane potential of −20 mV. Patch buffers used are 200 mM KCl buffer composed of 200 mM KCl, 90 mM MgCl2, 10 mM CaCl2, and 5 mM HEPES (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). The pH of patch buffer was 6.0, except for MscL A110H and A112H, which need to be treated with ZnCl2at pH 8.0 for histidine coordination. 0.5 μM to 2 mM ZnCl2 was applied to bath solution for 5 to 20 min for this purpose. Data were acquired at a sampling rate of 20kHz with a 5 kHz filter using an AxoPatch 200B amplifier in conjunction with Axoscope software (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA, USA). A piezoelectric pressure transducer (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL, USA) was used to monitor the pressure introduced to the patch membrane by suction throughout the experiments. Where possible, the pressure thresholds required for MscL gating within single patches were compared before and after treatment (e.g. addition and washout of Zn2+). To compare MscL pressure threshold sensitivities between patches of native membranes, MscS was used as an internal standard as described previously27,36; the changes in mechanosensitivity of MscL were measured by comparison of the pMscL/pMscS pressure threshold ratios. Measurements were performed using Clampfit9 from Pclamp9 (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA, USA). Agarose (Bio-Rad Hercules, CA, USA) bridge (2% agarose in 200 mM KCl buffer) was used as the reference electrode. To cleave disulfide bridges formed in the cysteine mutant MscL channels, 2–10 mM Dithiothreitol (DTT) was applied in to the bath solution for 3 to 20 min. As previously described,7,15,322–4 mM MTSET+(2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl methanethiosulfonate bromide) (Toronto Research Chemicals Inc, North York, Canada) was applied in bath solution (Cytoplasmic side of MscL) and single spontaneous opening of MscL channel with G22C or G22C plus Δ110-5 was achieved by opening a single channelviasuction to allow access of MTSET+. The calcein efflux assay was performed as previously described.19Pet21a plasmid was used for the construction and hosted in strain PB116, which is a λDE3 lysogenization (Novagen, San Diego, CA, USA) of PB10627. The MscL proteins were tagged with a multihistidine tag at their c-terminal ends. The histidine-tagged MscL proteins were purified12and reconstituted into lipid vesicles composed of in molar 70 % 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, 10 % Cholesterol and 5 % 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[methoxy(polyethylene glycol)-2000] (Avanti Polar Lipids Inc., Alabaster, AL, USA). After protein reconstitution was performed at 60 °C for 30 min in the presence of Anapoe-X-100 (Anatrace Inc.), calcein was added and allowed to equilibrate with the liposomes at room temperature for 20 min. The detergent was removed by biobeads incubation overnight at 4°C. Free calcein was then removed by passage through a G-50 fine Sephadex column (GE Healthcare Inc., Piscataway, NJ, USA) washed with vesicle buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 500 mM sucrose, pH 8.0). Vesicles were placed into clear 96-well plates and their fluorescence was recorded at 538 nm with the excitation at 485 nm using a Fluoroskan Ascent (Thermo Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). The baseline of samples was recorded for 5 min followed by 30 min recording in the presence of 1 mM MTSET+. Vesicles were finally lysed by the addition of 0.5 % Triton X-100 to determine the total fluorescence levels of calcein encapsulated in vesicles. The authors thank Drs.
