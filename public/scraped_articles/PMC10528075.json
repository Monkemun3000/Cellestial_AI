Numerous studies have shown that in normal mammalian cells grown in culture, microgravity induces an array of phenomena such as apoptosis and changes in their cytoskeleton, as well as in signal transduction, cell differentiation, proliferation, migration and adhesion. Effects differ depending on the cell type [1]. Microgravity also alters differentiation and augments apoptosis in thyroid carcinoma cells [2,3] and alters breast cancer-derived cells [4]. Microgravity is thus considered as a platform to study the metabolism of normal, developing, mature and cancerous cells, as well as the potential pharmacological approaches to treat, on Earth, neurodegeneration, developmental disabilities and cancer. We have pioneered the study of simulated microgravity (sim-μG) using the “the 3D-clinostat” robot (Mitsubishi Heavy Industries) on neural cells and, in particular, neural stem cells and oligodendrocytes (OLs). OLs are the myelinating cells in the central nervous system (CNS) and are essential for the efficient synthesis and maintenance of myelin [5,6]. They form the compact segments of the myelin membrane that coil around the axon and allow for the saltatory conduction of action potentials, ensuring the healthy functioning of the CNS. Neurological diseases involving this cell type are characterized by myelin loss and an impairment in nerve conduction. A lack of or damaged myelin is debilitating and disabling because the nerve impulses slow down or even stop, causing neurological deficits. Understanding how OL progenitors (OLPs) differentiate and form myelin sheaths around nerve axons is of interest for the prevention and treatment of myelin-associated diseases. In many cases, OLPs fail to mature and, therefore, they cannot remyelinate axons in dys- and de-myelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease or after a traumatic injury. Moreover, a chronic lack of myelin leads to axonal transection [7]. As neurological impairments have been observed after human space journeys, e.g., intracranial hypertension (ICP) and visual impairment intracranial pressure (VIIP), we have studied in previous papers the effects of artificial microgravity on cultured OLPs. Our first study using BrdU revealed that rodent and human OLPs displayed enhanced and sustained proliferation while they were in sim-µG with a concomitant shortening of the cell cycle. Moreover, these cells appeared to remember having been in µG and continued to proliferate more after having been placed in Earth’s gravity [8]. More recently, we studied the effects of space-µG on OLPs and found enhanced proliferation [9], yet some of them displayed incomplete cytokinesis [10]. Moreover, based on the expression of stage-specific developmental markers, we discovered that these cells came back in a more immature stage than that of the ground control OLPs [10]. Here we sought to determine A) the impact of space flight on the global metabolomic profile of the secretome produced by OLPs while in space-µG in order to start unraveling extracellular processes, as well as identifying gravitational-sensitive molecules, and B) the energetic status of OLPs after space flight. We found the presence of some gravitational-sensitive molecules, as well as enhanced energy and glutamate metabolism in the secretome generated while the OLPs were on board the International Space Station (ISS). Notably, we found an elevated energy demand in the OLPs upon return to Earth, which led to an increased use of glycolysis to support their energy demands. 2.1. Culture System for OLPs and Pre-Myelinating OLs Complete DMEM/F12 medium with supplements. 2.2. Hardware and Space Flight For structurally unnamed biochemical, mass spectral entries have been created and identified by virtue of their recurrent nature (both chromatographic and mass spectral). The asterisk in figures indicates that this compound has been identified based on two of the three characteristics mentioned above. Compounds identified in this manner, have the potential for their future identification by classical structural analysis. Alternatively, a new standard may be added to the library and the biochemical name confirmed. To determine the statistical significance, Welsh’s two-samplet-tests were performed on the SPC, 1G and control medium groups ofn= 5 in ArrayStudio (Omicsoft) or “R” to compare data between them;p< 0.05 was considered significant (Array Studio, RRID:SCR_010970). The false discovery rate (Q-value) was calculated to take into account the multiple comparisons that normally occur in metabolomic-based studies, with Q < 0.05 used as an indication of high confidence in a result. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Hierarchical Clustering Analysis (HCA) were performed in ArrayStudio. Random forest analysis was performed as described [18,19]. For the box plots, whiskers reflect the 5th and 95th percentiles (with the box displaying the 25th to 75th quartiles); the bisecting line represents the population median, while “+” represents the population mean, [20]. We only considered the molecules that presented a significant difference (p< 0.05) between the groups shown, with a metabolite ratio of <1.00. Synopsis of passive experiments. OLPs came back alive and were used for the respirometry analysis, a part of the Bioscience-4 space biology NASA experiment. These cells were flown to the ISS on board SpaceX-21 (A). It was launched on 6 December 2020 and landed (splashdown) on 13 January 2021. The cells remained in microgravity for 38 days. Its orbit height was 254 miles; its speed at orbit was 4.76 miles/s; and maximal speed reached 17,400 mph. On Earth, humans are exposed to 3 to 4 millisieverts (mSv) of radiation from natural sources per year, mainly from cosmic rays that make it through the atmosphere. On the ISS, astronauts receive about 150 mGv per six months. For the current mission, the average daily total radiation dose was 0.425 (mGv) on board the space station. This experiment is called “passive” because it was designed to mimic the trajectory that astronauts’ brains undergo during space flight (i.e., launch, stay in space, and splashdown when returning to Earth) without manipulation or medium change. (B) Example of mesh without cells. OLPs were seeded on the floating mesh carriers. (C) View of the 8-well Petri dishes used for the passive experiments on Earth. (D) All cells were maintained at 37 °C for the duration of the experiment. (E) View of the external shell in which the units travelled and stayed while in space. The same number of chambers was flown to space or stayed on Earth in our laboratory as ground control. Ground control cells were also seeded in these containers and maintained at the same temperature and conditions in our laboratory; the only difference was gravity vs. microgravity. (F) Secretome collected from each well separately. Upon splashdown, they were transferred from the Kennedy Space Center to the World Carrier and brought to our laboratory (UCLA) at 37 °C. Upon return from space, we ascertained a drop of pH from 7.4 to 7.1, which should represent the negligible effect of CO2 levels on the cells’ metabolism. For the assay, the OLPs were seeded onto an XF24 Cell Culture Microplate (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) at 5 × 104cells per well in OSM. The cells were kept for 24 h in standard culture conditions (37 °C, 4.5% CO2). The following day, the wells were filled with fresh OSM. The following day, some of the supernatant was removed from the well plates. We used an XF24 Analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience, North Billerica, MA, USA) to measure the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR). The OCR and ECAR reflect the rates of cellular respiration and glycolysis, respectively. Measurements were performed with the cells in unbuffered Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) supplemented with 1 mM of pyruvate, 2 mM of glutamine, and 25 mM of glucose. Measures were recorded before (basal reading) and after the sequential injections of oligomycin, FCCP and rotenone/myxothiazol. The mitochondrial respiration was the difference between the total and rotenone/myxothiazol response. The maximal OCR was the response to the FCCP, whereas the maximal ECAR was the response to oligomycin. Values were normalized to the cellular protein concentration, determined with the protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) in all experiments. 3.1. Global Profile of the Secretome from the Different Treatments Comparative view of the number of metabolites that contribute to the secretome composition in SPC OLPs vs. 1G OLPs and vs. medium alone, respectively. Column one shows the secreted molecules produced by OLPs in Earth’s gravity. Column two shows the secreted molecules produced by OLPs over 26D while in the ISS (secretome from the tank found underneath the automated hardware units). Column three shows the difference of metabolites up or downregulated in SPC vs. 1G OLP secretome. Discriminative power of secretome analysis. The diagram (A) shows the comparison of metabolites secreted by OLPs with regard to their media and SPC vs. 1G. The random forest analysis (B) represents the 30 top-ranking biochemicals in the secretomes. 3.2. Glycolysis and Energy-Related Metabolism Comparison of metabolite utilization by 0G and 1G OLPs showed that in space, OLPs secreted significantly more fumarate than their 1G counterparts. OLPs from both groups secreted high levels of citrate and lactate, although with a slight but significantly higher level in 0G OLPs. (n= 5). For box plots, whiskers reflect 5th and 95th percentiles (with the box displaying 25th to 75th quartiles); bisecting line represents the population median, while the plus sign (+) represents population mean; for details, see [21]. Comparison of metabolites secreted by OLPs grown in 0G or 1G vs. OSM culture medium alone. The figures in columns 1 and 2 represent the ratio of the signal intensities between the secretomes (1 G or 0 G) and OSM. Column 3 compares these two ratios. The numbers in green indicate a low release (pyruvate, phosphate) and those in red a high release. The statistical significance of these ratios was rated applying the Welsh two-samplet-test, with rho ≤ 0.05 for the first nine metabolites and for phosphate, and ≤0.05 < rho < 0.1 for the others. 3.3. Differences in Glutamate Metabolism Comparison of metabolite utilization by SPC and 1G OLPs showed that in space, OLPs secreted significantly more glutamate and glutamine while both groups secreted similar levels of alpha-ketoglutarate (1G) (n= 5). For box plots, whiskers reflect 5th and 95th percentiles (with the box displaying 25th to 75th quartiles); bisecting line represents the population median, while the plus sign (+) represents population mean; for details, see [20]. 3.4. Differences in Lipid Metabolism 3.5. Space Flight Elicits Higher Respiration Rates in hiPS-Derived OLPs Space-flown OLPs and 1G cells were cultured in Seahorse Bioscience V7 plate for 20 h. A higher basal OCR, mitochondrial and higher maximal OCR showed significant differences with regard to SPC OLPs, indicating that the cells were in a higher bioenergetics state. Interestingly, there were not significant differences for the ECAR. There were 12 samples per experiment. Values are expressed as mean+SD. Student’st-test revealed that these differences were **:p< 0.01 ***:p< 0.001 vs. respective controls. We all were born, developed and have lived in Earth’s gravity and, for technical reasons, the effect of gravity has been, so far, poorly explored, although its mechanical effects are germane to the well-documented effect of cell contacts during their growth, development and differentiation. In our current study, we examined the metabolomic profile of the secretome produced by OLPs in space and discovered subtle but significant changes in the metabolite levels of the SPC OLPs vs. the 1G OLPs. Indeed, we found a differential regulation of metabolites in response to weightlessness. In addition, glutamate production and energy requirements were also increased. 4.1. Glycolysis and Energy Related Metabolites The total energy intake of the brain corresponds to 20% of overall energy intake, even though it weighs 2% of a person’s weight. During development, glucose and lactate are the main source of energy for oligodendrocyte progenitors (OLPs) [21]. OLs use lactate as a source of energy as well as a precursor for lipid synthesis by converting it to pyruvate. Subsequently, pyruvate is transported to the mitochondria for the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), or converted to ATP in their cytosol via glycolysis. During development and myelinogenesis, OLs have high energy demands and are extremely vulnerable to energy deprivation [22]. Metabolic dysfunction is commonly associated with MS [23,24]. In these patients, acute hypoxia-like lesions, mitochondrial impairment and a reduction in complex I and complex IV of the electron transport chain are reduced [25]. There are several patterns of de-myelination and several classifications of MS. One is named oligodendrogliopathy, where the cell processes of OLs are dying back, and it is the distinctive characteristic for “pattern III” MS [26]. It has been reported that OLs’ metabolism is impacted by dimethyl-fumarate (DMF, Tecfidera®). This compound is being used for the treatment of MS [27,28]. It is believed that it modulates both antioxidant and lipid metabolism in OLs [29]. Patients treated with this molecule displayed a higher brain magnetization transfer ratio (MTR), and this was thought to correlate with the preservation of myelin density [30]. As observed previously in sim-μG, the OLPs secreted more fumarate and methyl-fumarate (mesaconate) in SPC while maintaining their progenitor stage [12]. Here, we show that the OLPs exposed to space μG displayed an enhanced need for energy with regard to their ground control counterparts. In addition, more lactate (produced during anaerobic oxidation to fulfill energy needs) was also significantly released by the SPC OLPs. The use of extra energy in the SPC OLPs cannot be explained through a stimulation of myelin synthesis; glycerate, a building element in the formation of triglycerides, was secreted by these cells, indicating that they were still at the immature developmental stage, while the 1G OLPs may have been moving forward towards maturation as previously demonstrated by Tran et al. [10]. Further studies are needed to ascertain the causes of such enhanced energy consumption by OLPs. The knowledge we have on the primary sources of energy for mammalian cells derives solely from experiments performed within Earth’s gravity. These sources are proteins, fats and sugars. Besides being a source of energy, lipids act as signaling molecules to direct OLPs and pre-myelinating OLs to either proliferation or maturation into myelinating OLs [46]. Moreover, fatty acids (FAS) are necessary for myelin synthesis. Myelin is the lipid-rich membrane that insulates the axons in the CNS, and it is essential for our daily life activities. Its composition differs from cellular membranes [47,48] in terms of their lipid to protein ratio, where lipids account for 70% myelin, whereas cholesterol and glycosphingolipids such as galactosylceramides, sulfatides and gangliosides account for 40% and 20% of the total lipids, respectively. Abnormal or impaired OLs result in severe CNS pathologies during development and in neurodegenerative disorders. In most myelin disorders, OLPs are present but fail to mature [49]. In the present study, we found that OLPs secreted phospholipids in a higher quantity in SPC than in 1G, except for certain species of phosphatidylcholine. In contrast, we did not observe differences in sphingomyelin secretion between 1G and SPC. Here, using respirometry measurements, we demonstrate important differences in energy metabolism. The SPC OLPs consumed more oxygen (basal respiration) and were able to increase respiration under stress (maximal respiration), suggesting a higher mitochondria-dependent energy demand, and probably a higher mitochondria content. Based on our previous work, we hypothesized that we would have more OLPs after space flight, yet we had to obtain confirmatory evidence. Both findings, the increased proliferation [8] and enhanced energy metabolism, are in agreement with our previous report where, using sim-µG, we revealed that there was increased mitochondrial respiration and increased glycolysis after 24 h of exposure to sim-µG [16]. Interestingly, in the case of the SPC OLPs, they showed preferential oxidative respiration rather than glycolysis. This is a different outcome from that obtained when using the 3D-clinostat. The reasons for these differences are currently unknown. Nonetheless, although the glycolytic reserve capacity appears not to have been used, the SPC OLPs still had higher energy demands after space flight. We previously performed the same secretome analysis of OLPs in sim-µG [9,10]. Although there was major difference in the measure of the secretome of OLPs, like time (3 days vs. 26 days) and method (µG in 3D-clinostat vs. SPC), it is interesting to compare the similarities and the differences. In both instances, lipid secretion, especially phospholipids, was increased in µG/SPC. Mitochondrial respiration was also elevated in µG/SPC, suggesting that this increased ATP demand could be necessary to sustain lipid synthesis/secretion, as well as cell proliferation. Comparisons of the TCA cycle-related metabolites were not identical: more fumarate was secreted in µG/SPC, but the α-KG secretion was discordant [12]. We do not know how long human OLs would take to synthetize myelin and myelinate axons in space, but we recently showed that these cells expressed earlier OLP markers with regard to the 1G OLPs; thus, the maturation of these cells appeared to be delayed [10]. Here, we observe another indication of a delayed lineage progression. What we do not know is whether this delay is transient as part of adapting to weightlessness, or it would result in an arrest of their development. Longer studies with OLPs in space could answer these questions. Finally, the Seahorse experiments revealed significantly higher mitochondrial respiration in OLPs after space flight, revealing that OLPs and their progenies remember having been in space. This is a very important point, as the SPC OLPs also proliferated more in 1G after returning to Earth, pointing toward the imminent need to perform epigenetic studies. An important difference with our studies in sim-µG is that the glycolysis was equivalent in the SPC OLPs and 1G OLPs, indicating that they did not need to switch to glycolysis as their last resource for energy. Since, in most myelin disorders, OLPs are present but fail to mature, our current study shows that glutamate and energy metabolism are significantly enhanced in response to microgravity. Therefore, both pathways are plausible targets to address OLPs’ maturation in MS, as well as other related myelin disorders and developmental disabilities like peri-ventricular leukomalacia, in order to enhance myelination in myelin-deficient CNSs. We have started to unravel the effects of microgravity on the metabolic pathways inherent to OLPs that show significant changes. Nonetheless, so far, they appear not to be deleterious and appear to remain functional in astronauts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that uses space as a novel platform to understand molecular changes in OLs at their progenitor stage. How this new knowledge is applicable to astronauts will become clearer when more studies of this nature are performed as they embark on long-term space missions. Years ago, we started our work using microgravity to test if we could produce healthier human OLPs in short periods of time, aiming at transplanting them to remyelinate myelin-deficient CNSs, like in the case of MS or leukodystrophies. We have shown that both sim-µG and space microgravity increase OLPs’ proliferation. The present study provides evidence that OLPs produce glutamate and that this is enhanced by space flight, contributing perhaps to maintaining OLPs in an immature stage. This point is crucial to elucidate, as the modulation of glutamate in MS patients might lead to enhanced myelination.
