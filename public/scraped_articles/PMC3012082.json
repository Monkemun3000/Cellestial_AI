Infections with nontyphoidalSalmonellaserovars are a leading cause of bacterial enteric disease and are the single most common cause of death from food-borne illnesses in the United States[1]. An essential feature of the pathogenicity ofSalmonellais its interaction with host intestinal epithelial cells, whereSalmonellainvasion/entry into host cells is critical for bacterial survival and establishment of disease in a host. Currently, it is thought thatSalmonellainvasion of epithelial cells requires the Type Three Secretion System (T3SS), a Gram negative bacterial “molecular syringe” that injects effector proteins into the host cell cytosol, thus altering cellular functions[2],[3],[4].Salmonellapossesses two T3SSs that direct the secretion of proteins into host cells, and a third T3SS that directs the secretion of proteins to be assembled into the external flagellular organelle[5],[6]. The T3SS considered to be necessary for epithelial cell invasion is encoded on Salmonella Pathogenicity Island-1 (SPI-1), a large region of theSalmonellagenome that contains numerous genes involved in pathogenesis and infection[6],[7],[8],[9]. The second T3SS is encoded on a second pathogenicity island, SPI-2, which is induced afterSalmonellainvasion of host cells and secretes protein effectors necessary for intracellular bacterial trafficking and replication[10],[11]. The third T3SS is under the transcriptional control of theflhDCoperon, the master regulator of the flagellum assembly machinery[5],[12],[13],[14]. A) Rotating Wall Vessel (RWV) bioreactor containing cell culture media and porous microcarrier beads. B) Sedimentation of cells within the RWV is offset by the rotating fluid, creating a constant free fall of the cells through the culture medium, allowing the cells to form 3-D aggregates under conditions of physiological fluid shear. Three-dimensional aggregates are taken out of the bioreactor for analysis including light microscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) (i), or seeded evenly in a 24 well plate format for various profiling and infection assays (ii). C) Enlarged representation of intestinal epithelial cells attached to microcarrier beads of a 3-D aggregate. After intestinal epithelial cells adhere to the beads, they begin to differentiate and displayin vivo-like characteristics such as narrow columnar cellular morphology, basement membrane, tight junctions, mucus, and microvilli[31],[32],[36]. D) A further enlarged depiction of a single bead within the 3-D aggregate displaying characterized cellular surface structures and components, and infected withSalmonella. In this work, we demonstrate several key aspects ofSalmonellapathogenesis during infection of RWV-derived 3-D organotypic models of human colonic epithelium that mimicin vivoobservations, but contradict prevailing paradigms established using monolayers and many non-human model systems. We report for the first time thatSalmonellais able to invade 3-D intestinal cells independently of all knownSalmonellaT3SSs, including SPI-1 and SPI-2 encoded T3SSs and the flagellar secretory system regulated by theflhDCoperon[13]. Within the 3-D intestinal epithelial aggregates, we were able to identify three different epithelial cell types that are present in the human large intestine, further showing the complexity and physiological relevance of the 3-D intestinal model. Unlike previousin vitroreports, there was no identifiable preferential host cell type targeted in our 3-D intestinal models during infection by wildtype or the T3SSSalmonellamutants[39],[40],[41],[42]. Non-invasive bacterial strains, bacterial-size beads, and heat-killedSalmonelladid not appear to be localized intracellularly in 3-D intestinal cells, demonstrating that an active bacterial invasion mechanism(s) is necessary for internalization, rather than a non-specific host cellular uptake mechanism. Following invasion of 3-D cells, the SPI-1, SPI-2, SPI-1/2 double mutant, and the SPI-1/2flhDCtriple T3SS mutant, all grew to similar levels intracellularly, but to substantially lower levels than wildtypeSalmonella. Collectively, we provide evidence that our highly differentiated 3-D models of human colonic epithelium exhibit infection phenotypes that are consistent with anin vivoentericSalmonellainfection. To our knowledge, this is the first report that bacterial invasion, but not intracellular growth, is largely independent of the functions encoded by TTSSs. Salmonellainvades 3-D intestinal cells in the absence of SPI-1, SPI-2, and flagellum T3SSs and their effector proteins A) HT-29 monolayers (black bars) and 3-D aggregates (grey bars) infected with wildtype, ΔinvA, ΔSPI-1, ΔSPI-2, and ΔSPI-1/2Salmonellamutants for 1 hour at an m.o.i. of 10.

SalmonellaT3SSs are required for substantial intracellular growth in 3-D HT-29 cells Intracellular growth of wildtypeSalmonella,T3SSSalmonellamutants, and non-invasiveE. coliandB. subtilisstrains measured at 3 hpi (black bars), 8 hpi (gray bars), and 24 hpi (white bars) in HT-29 monolayers (A) and 3-D aggregates (B). For both cell culture models, HT-29 cells were infected at an m.o.i. of 10 for 1 hour and lysed at each indicated time point and plated to enumerate bacterial CFU. CFU quantitation represents an average of at least three independent experiments from three separate batches of cells. * and ** indicate statistical significance ofp<0.05 and 0.001, respectively, comparing 8 and 24 hpi to 3 hpi for each bacterial strain. In previous work, we established and characterized a 3-D organotypic model of human large intestinal epithelium from the colonic epithelial cell line HT-29 utilizing the cellular suspension RWV bioreactor system[32],[36]. HT-29 cells grown in three-dimensions in the RWV displayed numerous characteristics relevant to theirin vivotissue counterparts, demonstrating the potential of utilizing RWV-derived 3-D cells as surrogate models to elucidate cellular mechanisms and responses to conditions encountered in the human gastrointestinal tract, such as during an enteric pathogen infection[32],[36]. We previously reported that aninvA Salmonellamutant (which is defective for invasion of monolayers) invaded into 3-D HT-29 cells to similar levels as wildtype, and to our knowledge, this was the first report to suggest that the SPI-T3SS may not be the main determinant for invasion ofSalmonellaintoin vitromodels of human intestinal epithelium[32],[43]. While intriguing, our previous findings did not definitively preclude a role for the SPI-1 T3SS in intestinal invasion, nor did we apply the 3-D large intestinal model to investigate the role of the two other T3SSs inSalmonella, the SPI-2 encoded T3SS and theflhDCregulated flagellum secretory system. In this report, we fundamentally expanded our studies to show that the 3-D model of large intestinal epithelium displays multicellular complexity relevant to the normal parental tissuein vivo, including formation of M-cells/M-like cells, enterocytes and Paneth cells. We subsequently applied these highly differentiated 3-D intestinal cultures as human surrogate infection models to elucidate the role of all characterizedSalmonellaT3SSs in the early stages of human enteric salmonellosis. Specifically, we infected 3-D HT-29 and monolayer cells with variousSalmonellamutants carrying single (SPI-1 or SPI-2), double (SPI-1/2) and a complete T3SS knockout (SPI-1/SPI-2:flhDC), respectively. We observed substantial differences in the roles of the T3SSs during invasion into and growth within the 3-D HT-29 cells as compared to monolayers, but notably, we identified similar key phenotypic responses between the 3-D cells followingSalmonellachallenge with those reported during thein vivoinfection process. The work presented here reveals many key similarities between the response of in vitro 3-D models of human intestinal epithelium and their parental tissuesin vivoduring aSalmonellainfection, highlighting the potential of these organotypic models to 1) serve as powerful tools to facilitate the dissection of the molecular mechanisms of human enteric salmonellosis, 2) provide anin vivolike system to study other gastrointestinal pathogens, and 3) serve as models for the development of novel strategies to combat infectious disease. Mammalian Cell Lines and Bacterial Strains Bacterial strains used in this study are described inTable S1. All bacterial strains were grown in Lennox broth (L broth) as described below[82]. The human colonic epithelial cell line, HT-29, was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)[32],[83],[84]. The cells were cultured in a specialized growth medium comprised of a triple-sugar minimal essential medium α–L-15 base supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, designated as GTSF-2[85], and incubated at 37°C at 5% CO2environment. Antibodies against specified antigens were obtained from the following sources: Sialyl Lewis A (MC-551; Kamiya), polyclonalSalmonellaO antisera (BD Difco), monoclonalSalmonellaantibody (MAI-83451; Affinity Bioreagents), syndecan-1 (MCA681T; AbD seroTec), Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) (ab58375; Abcam), ITF goblet cell marker (15C6; Santa Cruz), and Alexa Fluor 633 phalloidin (A22284; Invitrogen). Fluoresbrite plain YG 2.00 micron microspheres (fluorescent beads) were obtained from Polysciences, Inc. (18338). For mammalian cell viability, 0.4% trypan blue (Sigma) was used at a 1∶1 ratio with cells suspended in cell culture media. Growth of 3-D intestinal cells in the RWV The development of 3-D intestinal tissue models was performed as previously described[31],[32]. In brief, HT-29 epithelial cells were initially grown as monolayers in tissue culture flasks, trypsinized, and resuspended in fresh medium at a density of 2×106cells/ml. Cells were then introduced into RWV bioreactors (Synthecon, Inc.) together with collagen-coated Cytodex-3 microcarrier beads (Pharmacia), resulting in a final ratio of ∼10 cells/bead[85]. Cells were cultured in the RWV bioreactors in GTSF-2 at 37°C and 5% CO2with rotation at 20 rpm. Fresh medium was replenished after 5 days and then every 24 hours thereafter until harvest of the cultures at 18-23 days. Bacterial invasion and intracellular growth assays HT-29 monolayers were grown in GTSF-2 medium in a 24-well plate at a concentration of ∼1.2 million cells/plate. For 3-D aggregates, cells were harvested from the bioreactor and seeded into 24 well plates at a concentration of ∼19 million cells/plate. For infections, all bacterial strains were grown shaking overnight in L broth medium at 37°C. Bacteria were back-diluted 1∶200 and grown with aeration until the bacterial growth reached OD 600 of ∼0.8. Bacteria were washed twice with Dulbecco's PBS (D-PBS) and used to infect mammalian cells at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 10 for 1 h, whereupon infected cells were washed three times with D-PBS and incubated in medium containing 100 µg/ml gentamicin for 3 hour. The cells were then washed three times with D-PBS and fresh medium containing 7.5 µg/ml gentamicin was added. At indicated times post-infection (p.i.), media was removed, cells were washed with PBS, lysed with 500 µl of 0.1% Triton-X 100, and a fraction of the lysate was plated on L agar to enumerate colony-forming units (CFU). For heat killedSalmonellastudies, bacteria were taken from the back dilutedSalmonellacultures, washed 3 times with D-PBS, resuspended in D-PBS, heated at 90°C for 30 minutes, and used to infect mammalian cells as with liveSalmonella. Data sets in triplicate were analyzed using Microsoft Excel software to calculate the Student's unpaired t-test for independent samples. P-values of <0.05 (*) and <0.001 (**) were considered significant and highly significant, respectively.
