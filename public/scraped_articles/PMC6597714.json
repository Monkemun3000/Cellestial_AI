  "content": "Effect of Leptin Deficiency on the Skeletal Response to Hindlimb Unloading in Adult Male Mice Received 2018 May 4; Accepted 2019 Jun 6; Collection date 2019. Subject terms:Physiology, Endocrinology Leptin, a hormone produced primarily by adipocytes, serves as a messenger in a feedback loop between adipose tissue and the hypothalamus and contributes to regulation of energy intake and energy expenditure1,2.ob/obmice, homozygous for loss of function mutation in the obesity gene (ob), are unable to generate leptin1,2.ob/obmice become morbidly obese due to the combined influence of increased food intake and decreased energy expenditure1. The physiological actions of leptin extend beyond energy metabolism and include regulation of skeletal growth and maturation3–6; a detailed review of the effects of leptin on the skeleton can be found in Reidet al.7Leptin stimulates endochondral ossification and osteoblast differentiation and activity in long bones of the lower limb, where the hormone also inhibits differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells to adipocytes8–10. Compared to wild type (WT) mice,ob/obmice have smaller craniofacial dimensions11, shorter long bones12,13and, when evaluated by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), have lower total body and femur bone area, bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density (BMD)8. Based on microcomputed tomographic (µCT) and histomorphometric analyses,ob/obmice have bone- and bone compartment-specific alterations in cortical and cancellous bone mass and architecture8,14, and greatly increased levels of marrow adipose tissue (MAT)15,16. Whereas, total and cortical bone mass is normal or lower inob/obmice, cancellous bone mass, depending upon skeletal site and age, can be lower, normal, or higher7. Hypothalamic leptin gene therapy reverses skeletal abnormalities inob/obmice17. While the literature strongly supports an important role of leptin in increasing bone accrual prior to peak bone mass and in maintaining normal bone turnover, the hormone likely has additional, less well characterized, actions on bone metabolism. In this regard, there is conflicting evidence that leptin plays a role in mediating skeletal response to changes in body weight. Kapuret al. reported leptin signaling to be a negative modulator of bone mechanosensitivity18. Specifically, a loading strain of ∼2,500 μϵ, which was insufficient to produce a bone formation response in B6 mice, significantly increased bone formation parameters in leptin-deficientob/obmice. However, other studies suggest that leptin is required for full expression of positive effects of weight on bone mass. For example, total femur mass is positively associated with body weight in WT mice19. Also, mice heterozygous for theobgene (ob/+ mice) have adipocytes with a reduced capacity to generate leptin but have near normal leptin levels due to compensatory increases in white adipose tissue (WAT) mass19.ob/+ mice exhibit an association between body weight and bone mass nearly identical to WT mice. In contrast, weight differences inob/obmice have a positive but quantitatively smaller effect on bone mass20. Thus, it is possible that leptin is not required for skeletal adaptation to changes in weight but the hormone may enhance the magnitude of response by increasing sensitivity of bone to external loads. ob/obmice were pair fed to WT mice from 4 to 16 weeks of age and all mice were pair fed to WT HU mice during HU. Food intake averaged 2.3 ± 0.0 g/d for two weeks prior to HU and 1.8 ± 0.1 g/d during HU (Supplemental Fig.S1). As expected (because of pair feeding), significant genotype, HU, or interaction effects were not detected for food intake. The respective and combined effects of leptin status and HU on body weight, abdominal WAT weight, seminal vesicle weight (an index of gonadal hormone status), blood glucose levels, and serum corticosterone and osteocalcin levels are shown in Fig.1. Compared to WT mice,ob/obmice had greater body weight (Fig.1a), abdominal WAT weight (Fig.1b), and corticosterone levels (Fig.1e), lower seminal vesicle weight (Fig.1c) and osteocalcin levels (Fig.1f), and no difference in glucose levels (Fig.1d). No significant difference in WAT weight was observed in response to HU but HU resulted in trends for lower body weight (p = 0.09) and blood glucose levels (p = 0.06). HU resulted in lower seminal vesicle weight and higher corticosterone levels. No significant genotype by treatment interaction was detected for any of the measured endpoints. The respective and combined effects of leptin status and HU on total femur are shown in Fig.2.ob/obmice had lower total femur bone area (Fig.2a), bone mineral content (Fig.2b), bone mineral density (Fig.2c), bone volume (Fig.2d), and bone length (Fig.2e) than WT mice. No significant difference in total femur bone area or length was observed in response to HU. However, HU mice had lower total femur bone mineral content, bone mineral density, and bone volume than control mice. No significant genotype by treatment interaction was detected for any of the measured endpoints. Following evaluation of total femur, bone architecture was assessed in the femur diaphysis, distal femur metaphysis, and distal femur epiphysis. The regions of interest are illustrated in Fig.3. Volume of interest for the femur diaphysis, metaphysis and epiphysis. Image compiled by J.A.K. The respective and combined effects of leptin status and HU on cortical bone microarchitecture in the femur diaphysis are shown in Fig.4.ob/obmice had greater cross-sectional volume (Fig.4a) and marrow volume (Fig.4c) but lower cortical volume (Fig.4b) and cortical thickness (Fig.4d) than WT mice. No significant difference in cross-sectional volume or cortical volume was observed in response to HU but cortical thickness tended (p = 0.06) to be lower with HU. IPolar(Fig.4e) was not different between genotypes and not altered by HU. No significant genotype by treatment interaction was detected for any of the measured endpoints. The respective and combined effects of genotype and HU on cancellous bone microarchitecture in the distal femur metaphysis are shown in Fig.5. Bone volume fraction (Fig.5a), connectivity density (Fig.5b), structure model index (Fig.5c) trabecular number (Fig.5d), and trabecular spacing (Fig.5f) were not different between genotypes. However,ob/obmice had lower trabecular thickness than WT mice (Fig.5e). HU resulted in lower bone volume fraction, lower trabecular thickness, and a tendency (p = 0.06) for lower connectivity density and structure model index. No significant difference in trabecular number or spacing was observed in response to HU. No significant genotype by treatment interaction was detected for any of the measured endpoints. The respective and combined effects of genotype and HU on cancellous bone microarchitecture in the distal femur epiphysis are shown in Fig.6. Bone volume fraction was not different between genotypes (Fig.6a). However,ob/obmice had greater connectivity density (Fig.6b), structure model index (Fig.6c), and trabecular number (Fig.6d), and lower trabecular thickness (Fig.6e) and trabecular spacing (Fig.6f) than WT mice. HU resulted in lower bone volume fraction and trabecular thickness and higher structure model index, but no significant difference in connectivity density, trabecular number or trabecular spacing. No significant genotype by treatment interaction was detected for any of the measured endpoints. The respective and combined effects of leptin status and HU on histomorphometric indices of bone formation, bone resorption, and bone marrow adiposity in the distal femur metaphysis are shown in Fig.7. Osteoblast perimeter (Fig.7a) was lower inob/obmice, while osteoclast perimeter (Fig.7b) and declomycin label length (Fig.7c) did not differ between genotypes. Mineralizing perimeter (Fig.7d), mineral apposition rate (Fig.7e) and bone formation rate (Fig.7f) did not differ with genotype.ob/obmice had greater bone marrow adiposity (Fig.7g), adipocyte density (Fig.7h), and adipocyte size (Fig.7i) than WT mice. HU resulted in greater osteoclast perimeter and lower declomycin label length. Mineralizing perimeter, mineral apposition rate, and bone formation rate did not differ with HU. No significant difference in adipocyte density or adipocyte size was observed in response to HU, but there was a trend (p = 0.09) for higher bone marrow adiposity. The differences between genotypes in marrow adiposity and osteoclast-lined bone perimeter with HU can be visually appreciated in Fig.8. No significant genotype by treatment interaction was detected for any of the measured endpoints in distal femur metaphysis.

Note the higher number of adipocytes inob/obmice and the higher number of osteoclasts in HU mice. Images taken by RTT. The respective and combined effects of genotype and HU on cancellous bone microarchitecture in 5thlumbar vertebra are shown in Table1. Bone volume fraction and trabecular thickness were higher and structure model index was lower inob/obmice compared to WT mice. HU resulted in lower cancellous bone volume fraction and trabecular thickness, and higher structure model index. However, significant genotype by treatment interactions were noted for trabecular number, trabecular spacing, and connectivity density. HU resulted in lower trabecular number and higher trabecular spacing in WT mice and higher connectivity density inob/obmice. Effects of genotype and hindlimb unloading (HU) on cancellous bone microarchitecture in the 5th lumbar vertebra in WT andob/obmice. Data are mean ± SEM; N = 10/group. aDifferent from control within genotype, P ≤ 0.05. We evaluated the skeletal response to HU in leptin-deficientob/obmale mice. Based on the observation that leptin deficiency attenuates the positive association between body weight and bone mass (e.g., more weight gain is required inob/obmice compared to WT mice to achieve a comparable increase in bone mass), we hypothesized thatob/obmice would exhibit diminished bone loss in response to HU. However, contrary to our expectations, the magnitude of HU-induced osteopenia inob/obmice in femur, a weight bearing bone, was virtually indistinguishable from that of WT mice. In concordance with previous studies in WT mice, cancellous bone loss in HU mice housed at thermoneutral was due to increased bone resorption. The increase in bone resorption was due, at least in part, to increased osteoclast-lined bone perimeter24. Leptin has differential effects on osteoclast number and activity in weight-bearing mice.ob/obmice have normal or increased osteoclast-lined bone perimeter25,26, indicating that the hormone is not required for osteoclastogenesis. Indeed, subcutaneous administration of leptin attenuates ovariectomy- and HU-induced bone loss in rats by reducing osteoclast number3,27. On the other hand, several lines of evidence suggest reduced osteoclast activity inob/obmice. Specifically,ob/obmice have low serum levels of CTX, a biochemical marker of global bone resorption20,26. In spite of elevated osteoclast-lined bone perimeter, resorption of declomycin is diminished in femurs ofob/obmice16. Furthermore,ob/obmice are resistant to polyethylene particle-induced osteolysis28. Finally,ob/obmice have impaired ability to remodel the calcified cartilage network in growing femur, leading to pathological retention of cartilage during skeletal maturation10,16,26. In the present study, bone resorption was increased in femur metaphysis inob/oband WT mice in response to HU. In support, we observed an increase in osteoclast-lined bone perimeter. Furthermore, we observed decreases in cancellous bone volume fraction and fluorochrome label retention. Specifically, declomycin label given at the start of the study was lower after two weeks of HU compared to weight-bearing mice, indicating greater resorption of fluorochrome labeled bone occurred with HU. This association between unloading and label loss is in agreement with previous spaceflight and HU studies in rats29. HU for two weeks had no significant effect on body composition in WT orob/obmice. This is important because changes in weight could independently influence bone turnover balance30. Thus, contrary to our expectation, skeletal unloading enhanced bone resorption in leptin-deficient mice. In addition to femur, we evaluated the respective effects of leptin deficiency and HU on lumbar vertebra. Cancellous bone loss occurs in lumbar vertebra in rodents subjected to microgravity34and the bone loss is due, at least in part, to increased bone resorption35. Femurs experience high levels of ground reaction forces in response to weight bearing, and these forces are abolished by HU. Lumbar vertebrae do not generally bear weight in mice. However, lumbar vertebrae are load bearing and HU alters the orientation of the vertebral column to the gravitational vector, changing the direction of the load36. Similar to femur, leptin deficiency did not prevent HU-induced cancellous bone loss in lumbar vertebra. While there were no genotype-specific differences in magnitude of cancellous bone loss in lumbar vertebra of HU mice, the bone loss in WT mice was due to a combination of decreased trabecular thickness and trabecular number, whereas the bone loss inob/obmice was due to decreased trabecular thickness only. Therefore, minor genotype-specific changes in bone microarchitecture accompanied changes in bone volume fraction in lumbar vertebrae following HU. MAT levels are often (but not always) negatively associated with osteoblast number and bone mass and are increased in humans following long-duration bed rest and in rodents following spaceflight and in some skeletal disuse models9,24,35,51–55. Osteoblasts and adipocytes differentiate from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and some researchers have concluded that adipocyte differentiation impairs osteoblast differentiation35. Furthermore, adipokines produced by MAT have the potential to increase bone resorption56–58. Thus, high levels of MAT in mice could theoretically diminish the skeletal response to mechanical loading by at least two non-mutually exclusive mechanisms, impairment of osteoblast differentiation and stimulation of osteoclast activity. Despite greatly increased levels of MAT in distal femur metaphysis ofob/obmice, the mice did not differ in cancellous bone volume fraction from WT mice. There were also negligible differences between the two genotypes in cortical or cancellous bone responses to HU. Taken together, these findings add to a growing list of studies that contradict a deterministic model where increased MAT levels invariably negatively affect bone metabolism59. These findings also fail to support a model where adipokines produced by MAT contribute to HU-induced bone loss. Cancellous bone volume fraction in femur inob/obmice has been variably reported to be lower14, equivalent (present study), or higher17than in age-matched WT mice. In our experience, cancellous bone volume fraction in the distal femur metaphysis in conventionally-housed (room temperature) mice declines with age in both WT andob/obmice, but the rate of decline is greater in WT mice. Impaired osteoclast activity inob/obmice provides a plausible explanation for slower age-related bone loss as well as reported differences in their skeletal phenotype. As expected, leptin deficiency and HU each resulted in higher corticosterone levels. Although glucocorticoids influence bone metabolism, Zerathet al.60reported that microgravity-induced cancellous osteopenia occurred independent of endogenous corticosterone secretion. Furthermore, elevation of endogenous corticosterone levels did not replicate the skeletal changes observed in HU rodents61. While these two studies do not rule out a role for adrenal hormones, it is important to note that parallel increases in corticosterone with HU were detected in WT andob/obmice. This is consistent with the similar magnitude of bone loss following HU in the two genotypes. There are limitations to the present study. The study focused on the role of leptin in skeletal response to changes in weight. While impact loading on the hindlimbs caused by weight is important to skeletal health, we cannot rule out that leptin plays a role in other forms of skeletal loading, such as loading mediated through muscle contraction. Furthermore, we performed the present study in male mice. Since estrogen is important in regulation of appetite, energy expenditure and metabolism, future studies comparing the skeletal response of femaleob/oband WT HU mice are warranted. The animals were maintained in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the Oregon State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved the experimental protocol. Four-week-old male C57BL/6J (WT, n = 20) mice and B6.Lepob/ob(ob/ob, n = 20) mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and single-housed in a 32 °C room for the duration of the experiment. Housing mice at 32 °C (thermoneutral temperature) minimizes resting energy expenditure74,75and prevents premature cancellous bone loss associated with cold stress induced by sub-thermoneutral housing49. Water was providedad libitumto all animals for the duration of study.ob/obmice were pair-fed to WT mice from 4 to 16 weeks of age to minimize differences in weight gain16. At 16 weeks of age, the mice were randomized by body weight into one of four treatment groups (n = 10/group): (1) WT control, (2) WT HU, (3)ob/obcontrol, and (4)ob/obHU. Immediately prior to HU, animals were given a declomycin injection (15 mg/kg; sc). The mice were unloaded for 2 weeks as described21. In brief, HU mice were placed in a restraint device, where the tail was cleaned with ethanol-soaked gauze and sprayed with a tincture of benzoin. A thin piece of traction tape was looped through a large paper clip, and then pressed along the sides of the mouse’s tail. Filament tape was wrapped around the tail in two locations to secure the traction tape: the base of the tail and 2.5 cm caudal. The paperclip end was looped through the clasp secured on the unloading apparatus. Mice were positioned in a 30° head-down tilt. During unloading, theob/obHU group and control groups of both genotypes were pair-fed to the WT HU group. The fluorochrome calcein (15 mg/kg; sc) was administered at 4 days and 1 day prior to sacrifice. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and terminated using decapitation. Blood was collected from the trunk following decapitation. Serum was stored at −80 °C. Femora and 5thlumbar vertebrae from each mouse were placed in formalin for 24-hour fixation, then stored at 4 °C in 70% ethanol. Body weight (g), abdominal WAT weight (g) and seminal vesicle weight (g) were recorded at necropsy. Blood glucose was measured using a glucometer (Life Scan, Inc., Milpitas, CA, USA) immediately following decapitation. Serum corticosterone (ng/ml) and osteocalcin (ng/ml) were measured using a mouse Corticosterone ELISA kit obtained from Abcam (Cambridge, MA, USA) and a mouse Gla-osteocalcin High Sensitive EIA kit obtained from Clontech (Takara Bio Inc Shiga, Japan), respectively. Total femur bone mineral content (BMC, g), bone area (cm2), and bone mineral density (BMD, g/cm2) were measured using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA, Piximus 2, Lunar Corporation, Madison, WI, USA). µCT was used for nondestructive three-dimensional evaluation of total femur bone volume (mm3), femur length (mm), and cortical and cancellous bone architecture. Femora were scanned using a Scanco µCT40 scanner (Scanco Medical AG, Basserdorf, Switzerland) at a voxel size of 12 µm × 12 µm × 12 µm (55 kVpx-ray voltage, 145 µA intensity, and 200 ms integration time). Filtering parameters sigma and support were set to 0.8 and 1, respectively. The threshold value for evaluation was determined empirically and set at 245 (gray scale, 0–1000). Cortical bone was evaluated in the femoral diaphysis and cancellous bone was evaluated in the distal femur metaphysis and epiphysis (Fig.3). Assessment of cortical bone in the femur diaphysis began 60% down the midshaft from the femoral head and consisted of 20 slices (240 µm in length). Automated contouring was used to delineate cortical bone from the marrow cavity. All cortical slices were visually examined for evidence of cancellous struts originating from the endocortex and manually removed when present. Direct cortical bone measurements included total cross-sectional volume (mm3), cortical volume (mm3), marrow volume (mm3), and cortical thickness (µm). Polar moment of inertia (mm4) was determined as a surrogate measure of bone strength in torsion. Assessment of cancellous bone in the distal femur metaphysis began 45 slices (540 µm in length) proximal to the growth plate, and included 40 slices (480 µm in length) of cancellous bone. The entire cancellous bone compartment was evaluated in the distal femur epiphysis (31 ± 1 slices) and 5thlumbar vertebral body (149 ± 1 slices). Direct cancellous bone measurements included bone volume fraction (bone volume/tissue volume; volume of total tissue occupied by cancellous bone, %), connectivity density (number of redundant connections per unit volume, 1/mm3), structure model index (an architectural index defining bone as plate-like or rod-like with values ranging from 0 to 3, respectively), trabecular thickness (mean thickness of individual trabeculae, µm), trabecular number (number of trabecular intercepts per unit length, 1/mm) and trabecular spacing (distance between trabeculae, µm). Static (cell-based) histological measurements include osteoblast perimeter (osteoblast perimeter/bone perimeter; %), osteoclast perimeter (osteoclast perimeter/bone perimeter; %), bone marrow adiposity (adipocyte area/tissue area; %), adipocyte density (#/mm2), and adipocyte size (µm2). Osteoblast perimeter was determined as a percentage of total bone perimeter lined by cuboidal cells adjacent to a thin layer of osteoid in direct physical contact with bone. Osteoclast perimeter was determined as a percentage of cancellous bone perimeter covered by multinucleated cells with an acid phosphatase-positive (stained red) cytoplasm. Adipocytes were identified as large circular or oval-shaped cells bordered by a prominent cell membrane lacking cytoplasmic staining due to alcohol extraction of intracellular lipids during processing77. Fluorochrome-based measurements of cancellous bone formation included mineralizing perimeter (mineralizing perimeter/bone perimeter: perimeter covered with double label plus half single label, normalized to bone perimeter, %), mineral apposition rate (the distance between double calcein labels, divided by the 3 day interlabel period, µm/day), and bone formation rate (mineralizing perimeter multiplied by mineral apposition rate expressed per bone perimeter (µm2/µm/y). Retained declomycin label (single label perimeter/tissue area; mm/mm2) in the distal femur metaphysis was measured as a dynamic index of bone resorption. This method is based on the premise that treatment groups did not differ in bone formation (and as such fluorochrome label incorporation) prior to HU35and that differences measured at the study termination reflect the effect of treatment on resorption of the fluorochrome-labeled bone78.
