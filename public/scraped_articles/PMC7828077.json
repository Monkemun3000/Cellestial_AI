There has long been an interest in understanding how the hazards from spaceflight may trigger or exacerbate human diseases. With the goal of advancing our knowledge on physiological changes during space travel, NASA GeneLab provides an open-source repository of multi-omics data from real and simulated spaceflight studies. Alone, this data enables identification of biological changes during spaceflight, but cannot infer how that may impact an astronaut at the phenotypic level. To bridge this gap, Scalable Precision Medicine Oriented Knowledge Engine (SPOKE), a heterogeneous knowledge graph connecting biological and clinical data from over 30 databases, was used in combination with GeneLab transcriptomic data from six studies. This integration identified critical symptoms and physiological changes incurred during spaceflight. NASA recognizes five main hazards of spaceflight to human health, including altered gravity (microgravity and hypergravity), ionizing radiation, isolation/confinement, hostile/closed environment, and distance from Earth. These health risks caused by the space environment resemble multiple disorders found on Earth, including muscle atrophy and bone loss, cardiovascular deconditioning, immune dysfunction, and central nervous system deficits [1]. Therefore, repurposing current FDA-approved treatments for issues that arise during spaceflight could significantly reduce the time needed to develop new therapeutics and limit their side effects. NASA GeneLab is planning to set up a portal dedicated to computational modeling that enables comparisons between datasets in addition to already existing data input, query, analysis, and visualization capabilities. Knowledge graphs (KGs) would be a suitable approach to facilitate this goal by unifying disparate datasets into a human queryable framework. KGs have already been widely adopted in biomedical research to unravel the complex relationship between biological changes and disease phenotypes [6,7,8,9,10]. Specifically, a new massive UCSF-based KG database, the Scalable Precision Medicine Oriented Knowledge Engine (SPOKE) has transformed structured data from over 30 human biomedical databases (-omics, chemical structures, molecular and cellular responses, physiological data including e.g., patient symptoms and drug side effects, etc.) into a KG with almost 400,000 nodes of 12 types and over 10 million edges of 32 types [11,12]. Therefore, SPOKE has the potential to be combined with the NASA GeneLab modeling portal, expanding it to link terrestrial biomedical sciences to space biosciences research and space medicine. Analysis workflow and summary of experimental conditions across GeneLab datasets used for the analysis. (a) Workflow depicting the different stages of the analysis. (b) Datasets GLDS-4, -244, -245, and -246 used C57BL/6NTac mice. Datasets GLDS-288 and -289 used C57BL/6J mice for spaceflight and both C57BL/6J and Charles River mice for ground controls. 2.1. GeneLab Data Processing and Analysis Gene expression data were downloaded from the NASA GeneLab repository (https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/), datasets GLDS-4, GLDS-244, GLDS-245, GLDS-246, GLDS-288, and GLDS-289. All data had been processed and analyzed using standard NASA GeneLab techniques detailed below. Matched flight/live animal return versus ground control data was used for analysis. Data representing the quantitative analysis of gene expression for each dataset was downloaded from the NASA GeneLab repository, where it had been previously analyzed and imported into R [18] (version 3.6.3). It was then combined to create a gene counts table containing the data for all samples of every dataset. For GLDS-244, GLDS-245, and GLDS-246, only non-ERCC (External RNA Controls Consortium [19], i.e., a spike-in mixture used for normalization) genes were used. Data was normalized with DESeq2 [20] (version 1.26.0). A principal component analysis was performed using prcomp (stats version 3.6.3) and plotted using plotly [21] (version 4.9.2.1). For datasets containing DNA microarray assays (GLDS-4) raw CEL files were read in and normalized using an in-house R script as described [22]. To quantify overlapping pathways between GLDS-244, -245, and -246, Entrez Gene IDs of genes that showed a significant difference (p< 0.05) between 29-day flight/live animal return and ground controls were used as the input to Molecular Signatures Database v7.2, GeneOntology [23,24,25] (GO) gene sets. (GO biological process, GO cellular component, GO molecular function). The top 50 statistically significant gene sets were compared to identify overlaps. The same approach was applied to quantify the overlapping gene sets between GLDS-288 and -289. 2.2. Scalable Precision Medicine Oriented Knowledge Engine Scalable Precision Medicine Oriented Knowledge Engine (SPOKE) [11,12] is a population level heterogeneous knowledge graph. SPOKE was generated by unifying over 30 publicly available databases. Currently, SPOKE contains almost 400,000 nodes of 12 types (Anatomy,BiologicalProcess,CellularComponent,Compound,Disease,Gene,MolecularFunction,Pathway,PharmacologicalClass,Protein,SideEffect, andSymptom). These nodes are connected by 32 types of biologically meaningful edges (n> 10 million). 2.3. Gene-Specific Propagated SPOKE Entry Vectors Propagated SPOKE Entry Vectors (PSEVs) are generated using a modified version of topic-specific page rank to learn and embed the importance of each node in SPOKE for a given restart node or set of nodes [26,27]. These restart nodes, called SPOKE Entry Points (SEPs), are any concept in the input data that overlaps with a node(s) in SPOKE [28]. In this analysis, the SEPs were the mouse genes that have homologs to the humanGenenodes in SPOKE. A Gene PSEV was produced by allowing a random walker to traverse the edges in SPOKE and then forcing them to restart at a specificGeneSEP. The forced restart ensures that the walker will spend the majority of time on nodes that are important for thatGene. The significance of each node is then stored in an element of the PSEV such that the length of the PSEV is equal to the number of nodes in SPOKE (n= 389,297). Code used to generate the data in this manuscript is available at (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4408540). 2.4. Integrating Gene Expression Data and PSEVs For each study, the −log2fold-change (FC) mouse gene expression data was mapped to the human gene nodes in SPOKE. The homologous mapping between species was achieved using HomoloGene IDs [29]. If multiple mouse genes mapped to a single human gene, then the average FC was used. Additionally, some studies contained multiple comparisons between space and ground or baseline control mice. An example of this is the study GLDS-244 that compared mice at two space-time points (day-29 and days 53–56). In these instances, genes were removed if the FC comparisons were not in the same direction (i.e., if space versus ground day-29 had a positive FC and days-53–56 had a negative FC). This filter focuses on the data set of genes that remain consistent during space travel. After genes were mapped and filtered for a given study, the pre-computed PSEVs for the remaining genes were extracted. This PSEV matrix was z-score normalized and then ranked such that the most important node in a given PSEV was equal to the number of nodes in SPOKE (n= 389,297) and the least important was ranked one. Then for each comparison, the filtered PSEV matrix was adjusted using the FCs. This was accomplished by taking the product of a single column in the FC matrix and the filtered normalized PSEV matrix. It is necessary for the rows (genes) of the filtered normalized PSEV matrix to be in the same order as the rows in the FC matrix. Next, each column (node) in the adjusted PSEV-matrix was summed resulting in a vector in which each element or position corresponded to a node in SPOKE (length = 389,297). Each node was then ranked as before (with the highest value in the vector ranked 389,297). In practice, this was achieved by taking the dot product of the filtered FC matrix (transposed) and the filtered normalized PSEV matrix and then ranking the resulting matrix. 2.5. Finding Significant Spoke Nodes 2.6. Retracing Paths from Input Gene to SPOKE Node A high correlation between a gene’s FC and the rank of a specific node suggests that the gene FC is at least partially responsible for the prioritization of the node within a PSEVs. The correlation was calculated between genes (present in >20% of FC comparisons;n= 7567) and a set of topAnatomy,BiologicalProcess,CellularComponent,MolecularFunction,Pathway, andSymptomnodes (n= 22). Next, paths were found between genes that had a high correlation (correlation > 0.6) and the set of top nodes. Gene-node pairs were then filtered to only include pairs that had the same sign (positive gene expression and positive Welcht-statistic). Then, in order to visualize paths between gene-node pairs, paths were filtered to have a maximum of three edges and less than 100 possible combinations of nodes within the path. This left over 17,000 gene-node pairs and 234,000 possible paths. 3.1.

Fold-Change Enhanced Propagated SPOKE Entry Vectors Propagated SPOKE Entry Vectors (PSEVs) using gene expression fold-change (FC). (a) PSEVs were pre-computed for all SPOKE genes. For each gene, the random walker was forced to restart at that gene (probability of random jump = 0.1). After PSEVs were finished they were stored in the pre-computed PSEV matrix. (b) For each study, the pre-computed PSEV matrix was filtered and normalized. Then the dot product was taken between the normalized matrix and the FC matrix to generate the PSEV matrix for that study. (c top) The PSEV matrices for each study were pooled together and separated into groups: Ground vs. Baseline (blue), Space vs. Baseline (yellow), and Space vs. Ground (green). (c bottom) The distributions of the node ranks were adjusted using the mean Ground vs. Baseline rank. Retracing paths between genes and top nodes. Gene expression FC values drive information flow to nodes in SPOKE. (a–e) Paths were traced between genes that were partially responsible for pushing information to a set of significant nodes (n= 22). These paths were shown for (a) 10Symptomnodes, (b)taste receptor complex(CellularComponent), (c)regulation of cortisol secretion(BiologicalProcess) andVitamin D(calciferol)metabolism(Pathway), (d)regulation of vasoconstriction(BiologicalProcess) andregulation of blood vessel diameter(BiologicalProcess), and (e) sixAnatomynodes. Violin plots for each significant node show that the ranks within Space vs. Baseline and/or Space vs. Ground separated from the Ground vs. Baseline. In each violin plot Ground vs. Baseline (blue), Space vs. Baseline (yellow), and Space vs. Ground (green). One of the major objectives of biomedical research is to advance our understanding of human diseases in order to develop effective countermeasures. This aim becomes considerably more challenging when the physiological changes arise from spaceflight. Major efforts have been made by NASA GeneLab to collect and provide multi-omics data from model organisms. Additionally, NASA GeneLab data brought into the SPOKE system could be complemented by including murine phenotypical pathophysiological and biochemical non-omics data (more nodes) from the Ames Life Sciences Data Archive [34], and eventually the SPOKE system could be used for human spaceflight research data related to astronauts. However, the major challenges of analyzing any datasets generated during spaceflight are their low statistical power, considerable heterogeneity, and limited reproducibility [35]. These limitations are largely accepted by the scientific community as a reasonable trade-off for the novelty and potential for discovery these experiments entail. As a new strategy to maximize the utility of these datasets, we propose the data from model organisms can be integrated through a knowledge graph (KG) such as SPOKE. KGs including SPOKE, are bounded by present day biological knowledge. As a result, inferences made through SPOKE may change as our biological data and knowledge expands. Next, we hypothesized that, though this data came from a diverse set of experiments, SPOKE embeddings (i.e., “signatures”) could be used to recover space travel changes that are conserved across the studies. To accomplish this, −log2fold-change gene expression (FC) data from each study was applied to gene-specific Propagated SPOKE Entry Vectors (PSEVs). Gene-specific PSEVs are vectors that describe how important each node in SPOKE is for a given gene. Therefore, multiplying PSEVs by FC data will highlight nodes that are both important for the input gene set and to prioritize them according to how differentially expressed the input genes are. There is increasing interest in developing personalized risk predictions and treatments in support of long-duration deep space missions [36]. Thus, expanding the computational approaches from thegeneralcomparison of spaceflight and terrestrial diseases to using input from a single subject to map theirindividualrisk profile would allow developing optimal medical care for individual astronauts. Notably, the power of SPOKE stems from a wide variety of its inputs that combine multi-omics, clinical, and physiological data, which may provide a useful complement to the currently utilized risk management tools that are based upon probabilistic mathematical modeling and simulations [37].
