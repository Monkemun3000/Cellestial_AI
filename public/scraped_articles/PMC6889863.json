Introduction:Traveling to nearby extraterrestrial objects having a reduced gravity level (partial gravity) compared to Earth’s gravity is becoming a realistic objective for space agencies. The use of plants as part of life support systems will require a better understanding of the interactions among plant growth responses including tropisms, under partial gravity conditions. Long-term exploration of the Solar System will require that humans travel within a nearly close life-support systems, reducing to the minimum the amount of water, oxygen, and nutrients to be transported and optimizing the recycling of reusable waste. Such a system is being under development, for example, in the Melissa project from the European Space Agency (Godia et al., 2004), but it will require an edible plant to be successfully cultivated in the environmental conditions expected to be achieved during spaceflight and on arrival at nearby objects. Isolation chambers could avoid, at least partially, some of the suboptimal environmental conditions that can greatly compromise organism adaptation to spaceflight (Beckingham, 2010), including temperature, radiation, air, and soil composition constrains. However, providing artificial gravity will require large diameter centrifuge (Van Loon et al., 2008) or even expensive railroad-based platforms that could be subjected to other biological limitations. Gravity influences the direction of plant growth and the pattern of development, from seedlings to adult plants (Volkmann and Baluska, 2006), and even gravitational effects onin vitroplant cell cultures have been reported (Babbick et al., 2007;Barjaktarovic et al., 2007). Light is the only tropistic response that plays a substantial role in determining overall plant architecture with a contribution similar to gravity. Typically, plants orient their roots towards the gravity vector (positive gravitropic response), and away from blue/white light exposure (negative phototropic response). Shoots show the opposite orientation, growing away from the gravity vector (negative gravitropic response) and towards a blue/white light source (positive phototropic response;Kutschera and Briggs, 2016;Briggs, 2014;Chen et al., 1999). Any tropistic response is divided into three stages; perception, transduction and response. During the perception phase, starch-filled statoliths interact with other cellular components in the specialized columella cells. Once the gravity signal is perceived, a differential auxin gradient develops along the root to the root elongation zone (transduction stage), where differential plant growth occurs and leads to reorientation of the root in the direction of the gravity vector (reviewed inVandenbrink et al., 2014). Studies on the response of living organisms to altered gravity are greatly facilitated by the development of ground-based facilities for simulation of gravity alterations to perform basic science as well as to design and prepare for space experiments (Herranz et al., 2013). The biological system (cell proliferation and growth during early plant development) had previously been studied under real microgravity in the ISS (Driss-Ecole et al., 2008;Matía et al., 2010;Mazars et al., 2014). Similar effects to the ones observed during spaceflight (increased cell proliferation rates together with decreased cell growth parameters) also were observed in root meristem cells in simulated microgravity studies (Bouchern-Dubuisson et al., 2016;Valbuena et al., 2018) and in two partial-gparadigms. The imbalance of the cell proliferation and cell growth rates is also observable at the Moon´s gravity level, while less pronounced effects were observed at Marsglevel (Kamal et al., 2018;Manzano et al., 2018). In terms of spaceflight transcriptional experiments, a number of studies performed in orbit are available in public databases (Paul et al., 2012;Paul et al., 2013;Johnson et al., 2017;Zupanska et al., 2017). In these studies, some Gene Ontology categories as responses to biotic or abiotic stress, oxidative stress, cell wall reorganization and secondary metabolism remodeling commonly show the highest variation in gene expression. Transcriptional response in microgravity is different in each experiment, due to both the biological material (developmental stage or organ analyzed) and the technical/environmental constraints of each spaceflight experiment [late or early access to the sample during spaceflight, the hardware used, type of dissection/fixation/preservation see for example (Kruse et al., 2017)]. Seedling Growth Spaceflight Experiments Seeds ofA. thalianaecotypeLandsberg erecta(Ler) were flown to the ISSviathe SpaceX Dragon. Spaceflight experiments were conducted utilizing the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) in the Columbus Module of the ISS. The EMCS facility provides two centrifuges for creation of simulated gravity vectors, as well as atmospheric, temperature and hydration monitoring and control (Brinckmann and Schiller, 2002;Brinckmann, 2005;Kiss et al., 2014). In addition, the EMCS contains a video camera for image acquisition as well as monitoring of growth. The Seedling Growth series of experiments was conducted in two parts. The first set of seedlings were uploaded on SpaceX CRS-2 (March 2013) followed by returnviaCRS-3 (May 2014), and the second set of seedlings were carried to the ISS on SpaceX CRS-4 (September 2014) and returned on CRS-5 (February 2015). Experimental containers were uploaded to the ISS and loaded into the EMCS as previously described (Kiss et al., 2014;Vandenbrink and Kiss, 2016;Vandenbrink et al., 2019). Experimental conditions were controlled remotely from the Norwegian User Support and Operations Centre (N-USOC; Trondheim, Norway). The experiment was initiatedviahydration of the seeds. Plants were grown under 6 nominal gravity conditions produced by different rotational speeds on the EMCS centrifuge, microgravity (stopped EMCS centrifuge), 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.8, and 1.0g. The angular speed to generate each fractional gravity level was calculated for the cassette in the center of the Experimental Container. In the case of the 1.0 g cassettes, the value was calculated for the fifth cassette in order to prevent values higher than Earth nominal gravity. Seedlings were illuminated under white light (30–40 µmol m−2s−1) for 96 h, followed by 48 h of unidirectional photostimulation with blue light. Light sources were LEDs (Kiss et al., 2014). RNA-Seq analysis was only conducted on seedlings exposed to unidirectional blue light. After conclusion of the experiments, seedlings were frozen in dedicated holders by placing them at -80°C in the General Laboratory Active Cryogenic ISS Experiment Refrigerator (GLACIER) freezer of the ISS. Upon return of frozen seedlings to Earth, samples were transported on dry ice and immediately preserved with RNALater for subsequent RNA-Seq analysis. RNA was extracted individually for each EC TROPI cassette for most of the samples (i.e. from 24 cassettes, 20 samples were obtained to collect approximately 10–15 seedlings per extraction). A plant specific RNA extraction NucleoSpin kit (MACHEREY-NAGEL, Catalog # 740949.250) including a DNase treatment was used to isolate whole plant mRNA. The quantity and quality of the extracted RNA was determined by Nanodrop 2000 (Thermo Scientific). Extracted RNA was keep frozen at −80 C until shipped on dry ice to the David H. Murdoch Research Institute in Kannapolis; North Carolina, USA. During sequencing, twenty total RNA samples were used to generate twenty sequencing libraries using the Illumina TruSeq RNA Library Preparation Kit (Illumina, USA). Samples were individually indexed. The samples then were combined at equimolar proportions into three pools with 6–7 samples per pool. Each pool was loaded onto a single lane of a flow cell. A 125bp paired end sequencing run was performed on the Illumina HiSeq2500. Paired-end 125bp reads were aligned to theArabidopsisTAIR10 genomes using the HISAT2 pipeline on the Clemson University Palmetto Cluster (Kim et al., 2015). Fragments with a Phred score below 33 were filtered using Trimmomatic (Trimmomatic, 2013). HISAT2 (v2.1.0) was used to align sequencing reads. Reads were assembled into transcripts using StringTie (v1.3.4). Annotation was conducted using TAIR10 FASTA sequence the TAIR10 genome GTF annotation file (www.arabidopsis.org). This transcriptional dataset has been submitted to the GENELAB database (https://genelab.nasa.gov) and it will be released with the reference GLDS-251. Differential Gene Expression Analysis Statistical analyses of differential gene expression was conducted utilizing DESeq2 (v1.18.1;Anders and Huber, 2010). A multiple-test corrected p-value (q-value;Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995) of 0.05 was employed. The 20 samples were organized to reduce theg-level interval within biological replicates so the following groups were established: microgravity (stopped EMCS centrifuge, 4 replicates), low gravity (0.09 ± 0.02g, 3 replicates), Moon gravity (0.18 ± 0.04g, 3 replicates), Mars gravity (0.36 ± 0.02g, 3 replicates), reduced Earth gravity (0.57 ± 0.05g, 4 replicates) and 1gcontrol (0.99 ± 0.06g, 3 replicates). Venn Diagrams comparing the number of differentially expressed genes (DEG) across gravity levels were created using jvenn [http://jvenn.toulouse.inra.fr/app/index.html(Bardou et al., 2014)] with both q-value < 0.05 and p-value < 0.05. Afterwards, gene ontology (GO) analysis of specific groups of DEGs was performed using BinGO (Maere et al., 2005) with the full list of GO terms (GO_Full) or using PANTHER (Mi et al., 2019) with the molecular functions, biological process and cellular component GO lists. Subcellular localization of DEGs was analyzed using the abundance tool (MMAP) of the Subcellular Localization Database for Arabidopsis Proteins [SUBA4, (Hooper et al., 2017)]. For a global view of the whole genome transcriptional status alongg-levels into the SG1 and SG2 experiment (comparisons versus 1g), global expression patterns were calculated using the Gene Expression Dynamics Inspector (GEDI v2.1) program analysis (Eichler et al., 2003). GEDI profile allows the visualization of the gene expression across the transcriptome generating a mosaic image or dot matrix, consisting of 5 x 9 pixels (average of 5–14 probe sets/tile) using a self-organizing map algorithm and standard setting of the software (Eichler et al., 2003). Analysis was done using the signal log2 ratio of the selected probe sets through using the 5,571 probes with any significant (p < 0.05) change in expression from more than 21,000 sequences assignated to annotated genes. The same study was repeated adding the false discovery rate correction (FDR, q < 0.05, 861 genes). Each pixel represents a group or cluster of genes that share a similar transcriptional profile in any experimental condition. Each pixel has a color which reflects the average expression of the genes included in the cluster for each experimental condition compared to 1gcontrol in each panel. The GEDI program SOM algorithm determines which genes should be assigned to each cluster, and then places similar clusters in a nearby area of the mosaic, creating an image and allowing global transcriptome analysis as a single entity for display in different gravitational conditions. For certain pixels of interest, the gene list extracted from the clusters was used to find functional links between genes using Genemania App embedded into the Cytoscape v3.6.1 (Shannon et al., 2003) software with default settings.

Partial Gravity Differential Effect Whole-genome transcriptional status variations alongg-levels into the SG1/SG2 experiments (comparisons versus 1g). A 5x9 clustering analysis of the differentially expressed genes (in at least one of the partialglevels, using normalpvalues (first row, n = 5,571 genes) or adjustedq-values (second row, n = 861 genes) on the transcriptome have been done with the average of each gene expression level within a similarly expressed cluster across the samples. Values are shown according to the log2 ratio scales at the border of the figure (from highly overrepresented in red to highly down-represented in blue). The mean value of −0.3 or −0.7 indicates an overall repression in gene expression under microgravity. The gene density maps are shown in the middle of the figure for each analysis. Calculatedg-levels have been obtained by considering replicates the more similar samples across the nominal µg, 0.1g, 0.3g, 0.5g, 0.8gand 1g(precisely, µg(4 replicates), 0.09 ± 0.02g(3 replicates), Moon level (0.18 ± 0.04g, 3 replicates), Mars-level (0.36 ± 0.02g, 3 replicates), 0.57 ± 0.05g(4 replicates) and control 1g(0.99 ± 0.06g, 3 replicates).

Total number of up-regulated and down-regulated DEG (p < 0.05) are shown for the five reduced gravity conditions vs. 1gcontrol. The ten most significant gene ontology (Panther biological process GO Enrichment) categories for the three upregulated and the three downregulated DEGs are shown for the microgravity, low gravity (circa 0.1g) and Moon gravity (0.18g) vs. 1g(*** FDR q < 0.001, **FDR q < 0.01, *FDR q > 0.05). Blue Light Phototropism May Be Enough to Reduce the Gravitational Stress Response on Orbit Image analysis of seedlings grown during the Seedling Growth suite of experiments previously characterized a novel blue-light phototropic response in roots ofA. thalianagrown in conditions of microgravity (Vandenbrink et al., 2016). This relationship was shown to be linearly related to the magnitude of the gravity vector for plants exposed to red light, but plants exposed to blue light showed rapid attenuation of the response in the presence of increasing gravity levels. To determine the differential response to reduced gravity and attempt to dissect the molecular mechanisms of gravisensing, we performed RNA-seq analysis to characterize changes in gene expression that may be associated with the novel blue phototropic response. Interestingly, the effect of blue-light illumination is clearly observable in the microgravity samples, with a clear enrichment in GO terms related with light perception, photosynthesis and biosynthesis of the photosynthetic complexes as previously reported (Vandenbrink et al., 2019), but it is barely appearing in the GO enrichment analyses that we performed on partial gravity samples, even bellow 0.1g(lowgconditions). Surprisingly, the phototropic response to the blue light seems to be enough to cancel the effects of other genes of interest in gravitational research (as the ones observed at lowgor Moonglevel) to be not significantly affected in microgravity conditions. This result may be complementing previous reports from the same Seedling Growth spaceflight experiment but with plants exposed to red photostimulation. Fundamental plant functions, as cell proliferation and cell growth activity in root meristems, known to be affected by microgravity in the absence of light (Matía et al., 2010) are balanced just by providing a red photostimulation phase (Valbuena et al., 2018). In both red and blue photostimulation samples within the Seedling Growth experiment, roots are exhibiting a positive phototropism that can compensate the gravitropism stimuli role that it is required to preserve meristematic competence in orbit, as shown by the longer root growth in microgravity and 1gsamples in comparison with 0.1gseedlings (Vandenbrink et al., 2016). Low-gEffect: Competition Between Tropisms or Artifacts of Reduced-Gravity Simulation? An alternative explanation to the low-geffects that cannot be completely excluded could be put in connection with simulated microgravity experiments. Secondary effects of microgravity simulation facilities (shear or inertial forces) and even small variations in the environmental conditions of experimental and control samples may lead to gene expression variations in a similar set of genes as those observed in the low-gsubgroup in this work. Similarly, it is important to take into account the existence of hardware effects when growing plants in real microgravity (Kiss, 2015), including lack of convection, reduced CO2levels, improper temperature, elevated ethylene, spacecraft vibrations, increased radiation exposure, among others. However, the tropism conflict interpretation introduced early on this section seems to have a greater contribution than the artifacts of centrifugation in the low-geffects. A hardware side-effect explanation is less conceivable since the present study was conducted utilizing the European Modular Cultivation System, which contains an air scrubbing/filtration system designed for removing excess ethylene from the seedlings during the growth phase (Kiss et al., 2014;Kiss, 2015). Thus, even with proper ventilation, a reduction in gene expression of photosynthetic genes was observed in the microgravity samples (Vandenbrink et al., 2019). In the case of the samples exposed to centrifugation, the ventilation effect should be less important, but the centrifugation by itself could lead to additional stress in the samples. However, this centrifugation factor is also present in the 1gcontrol sample, exposed to even higher angular speeds. Spaceflight experimentation is required to verify that simulation strategies on Earth analogues are reliable and worthy. The continuous validation of the best simulation strategies will optimize and increase our chances of success in future spaceflight experiments (Herranz et al., 2013). Additional research in simulated low-gconditions on Earth or even in the Moon surface will help to extend and validate this research work.
