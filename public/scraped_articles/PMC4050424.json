Box 118205, Gainesville, FL 32611-8205, USA. E-mail:mdelp@ufl.edu Received 2012 Sep 6; Accepted 2012 Oct 15. Orthostatic hypotension was found to manifest among the astronauts of Project Mercury after only brief excursions into space, making this condition one of the first medical complications reported to occur in astronauts (1,2). Following short-term flight (2–3 wk) on the space shuttle, 20–50% of astronauts exhibit orthostatic hypotension when reexposed to normal gravitational stress (3–5), with the prevalence of this condition rising markedly after longer term (4–6 mo) habitation in microgravity (6). This orthostatic hypotension is due, in part, to a diminished ability to elevate peripheral vascular resistance (PVR; refs.3,7–9). One possible mechanism for the impaired ability to elevate PVR following spaceflight is a reduced magnitude or rate of vasoconstriction of the arterial resistance vasculature. Ground-based human and animal models used to simulate the effects of microgravity suggest decrements in vasoconstrictor responsiveness of arterial segments in various regions of the body, including the splanchnic circulation (10–13), as a potential mechanism contributing to orthostatic hypotension in astronauts. Experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and conformed to the U.S. National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH Publication no. 85-23, revised 1996). Experiments described herein were performed on distinct animal groups from three separate NASA space shuttle missions. Female C57BL/6 mice (16–23 wk old;n=11; Charles River, Raleigh, NC, USA) were flown on the STS-131 mission for 15 d. Microvessel dissection procedures commenced ∼2.5 h after the landing of the space shuttle, following isoflurane anesthesia and euthanasiaviaexsanguination. Female BALB/cJ mice (12–13 wk old) were flown on the STS-133 mission for 13 d. Animals were euthanized with a high dose injection of xylazine and ketamine (i.p., 30 mg/kg body weight xylazine plus 300 mg/kg body weight ketamine), and microvessel dissection procedures commenced precisely 1 d (R+1;n=2), 5 d (R+5;n=2), and 7 d (R+7;n=2) after the return landing. Female C57BL/6 mice (9 wk old;n=3) were flown on the STS-135 mission for 13 d. Microvessel dissection procedures commenced ∼3–4 h after landing, following isoflurane anesthesia and euthanasiaviacardiac puncture and exsanguination. Spaceflight group (SF) mice were housed in NASA's animal enclosure modules (AEMs) located on the orbiter's middeck, maintained on a 12-h light-dark cycle, and provided food (19) and waterad libitum. Age-matched ground-based control group (GC) animals were housed in identical AEMs within an orbital environment simulator at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) to mimic the temperature, humidity, and CO2of the space shuttle middeck. GC mice during the STS-131 (n=11) and STS-135 (n=9) missions were housed for the duration of each mission, beginning 48 h after launch and ending 48 h after landing. Aged-matched GC animals during the STS-133 mission were housed beginning and ending simultaneously to SF animals; experiments with GC mice (totaln=10) were performed simultaneously at theR+1 (n=3),R+5 (n=4), andR+7 (n=3) time points. All experimental procedures conducted on SF animals were duplicated on GC animals. The KSC veterinarian deemed all animals healthy prior to SF and GC experiments. Allin vitrolaboratory experiments involving animals from each space shuttle flight were identically performed as described below. Mesenteric tissue was dissected from the carcass, placed in physiological saline solution (PSS) buffer on ice, and transported in a staggered fashion from KSC to the University of Florida campus in Gainesville, FL (∼3-h drive). Distal arcading resistance arteries (STS-131, STS-133) and veins (STS-135) from the mesentery were then dissected free using a stereomicroscope (Olympus SZX12; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Vessels were transferred to a Lucite chamber containing PSS, cannulated at each end with glass micropipettes, securedvia11-0 ophthalmic sutures (Alcon Laboratories, Inc., Fort Worth, TX, USA), and pressurized with PSS. After cannulation, the isolated vessel tissue chamber was transferred to the stage of an inverted microscope (Olympus IX70) interfaced in series with a video camera (Panasonic BG310; Panasonic, Tokyo, Japan), a horizontal video caliper (307A; Colorado Video, Boulder, CO, USA), a data-acquisition system (Powerlab; ADInstruments, Colorado Springs, CO, USA), a video cassette recorder (VCR; Panasonic AG-7300), and a video monitor (Panasonic WV-BM1410). Vessels were equilibrated for 15 min at 37°C with an intraluminal pressure of 108 cmH2O for arteries (20) and 4 cmH2O for veins prior to investigation of vasoconstrictor and myogenic properties. The distance between cannulating micropipettes was adjusted following pressurization so that the vessel axial length was straight but not stretched. Bathing PSS was replaced every 15 min during equilibration and throughout the experimental procedures. Intraluminal diameters were continuously measuredviavideomicroscopic techniques (12,13). Intraluminal pressure was maintained and manipulated by way of two independent reservoirs connected to the glass micropipettes cannulating mesenteric arteries. The basal pressure of 108 cmH2O was achieved by setting both reservoirs to the same hydrostatic level. Active myogenic behavior was determinedviastepwise increases in intraluminal pressure (i.e., from 100 to 180 cmH2O) by raising the height of both reservoirs in 20-cmH2O increments. Intraluminal pressure was then decreased in 20-cmH2O increments from 180 to 100 cmH2O before return to basal pressure. Vasoconstrictor responses to increasing concentrations of KCl (10–100 mM) were measured to investigate the contribution of voltage-gated Ca2+channels. Target isotonic K+bath concentrations were achieved by balancing concentrations of NaCl and KCl in PSS such that bath osmolarity was maintained. Vasoconstrictor responses to the cumulative addition of norepinephrine (NE, 10−9to 10−4M) were measured to investigate α-adrenoreceptor-mediated vasoconstriction. Vasoconstriction through intracellular Ca2+release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum was determined by measuring arterial responses to caffeine (15 mM) as previously described (12,21). Maximal intraluminal diameter and medial wall thickness were determined after two 15-min incubations in Ca2+-free PSS at 108 cmH2O. A bolus dose of sodium nitroprusside (SNP; 10−4M) (22,23) was added during the second 15-min incubation in Ca2+-free PSS in order to ensure complete smooth muscle relaxation. Medial wall thickness was taken as the mean of three separate wall thickness measurements from positions randomly selected along the microvessel. In a second set of mesenteric arteries, passive vessel behavior was determined using identical procedures as that for the active myogenic response, except that the arteries were incubated twice for 15 min in Ca2+-free PSS with SNP (10−4M) present during the second incubation prior to and during determination of the pressure-diameter relation. During the NE dose-response test described above, a VCR was used to record the mesenteric artery constriction at 30 frames/s. To characterize mesenteric artery vasoconstrictor dynamics (12), the temporal response to NE was evaluated during the 10−4M NE dose by using a video caliper (307A; Colorado Video) to conduct frame-by-frame measurements of intraluminal diameter, beginning at the onset of vasoconstriction and proceeding until a steady state was observed. Time and diameter values were curve-fit to a monoexponential-plus decay model (24,25) using an iterative least-squares technique by means of a commercial graphing/analysis package (KaleidaGraph 3.5; Synergy Software, Inc., Reading, PA, USA). A user-defined function to the data was fit using the following equation: To determine whether alterations in adrenergic vasoconstriction of arteries returns to normal within 1 wk of return to terrestrial gravity, experiments were performed on daysR+1,R+5, andR+7 after landing. Mesenteric arteries were dissected and prepared forin vitroexperimentation. NE dose responses, maximal intraluminal diameter, and medial wall thickness measurements were performed as described above. Basal intraluminal pressure of mesenteric veins was set at 4 cmH2O. NE dose response curves were determined as described above for mesenteric arteries. Immediately after incubation in the final concentration of 10−4M NE, intraluminal pressure was decreased to 2 cmH2O for 3 min before increasing intraluminal pressure in a stepwise fashion up to 12 cmH2O in 2-cmH2O increments to determine the pressure-diameter relation. Maximal intraluminal diameter and medial wall thickness at 4 cmH2O were determined as described above for mesenteric arteries. Additional mesenteric arteries isolated from SF and GC mice from the STS-131 mission were snap-frozen and stored at −80°C for later analysis of mRNA levels as described previously (12,26,27). The RNAqueous-Micro Kit (Applied Biosystems/Ambion, Austin, TX, USA), specified for use in microdissected tissue, was used to isolate total RNA from mesenteric arteries. Vessels immersed in 100 μl of lysis buffer were homogenized using a pellet mixer (Argos Technologies, Elgin, IL, USA). The lysate solution was then passed through the RNAqueous silica filter for total RNA isolation. Total RNA was reverse transcribed into complimentary DNA (cDNA)viathe High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA). cDNA was then used in the real-time PCR (StepOnePlus; Applied Biosystems) to determine mRNA levels by way of TaqMan gene expression assays and endogenous controls (Applied Biosystems) specific for ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR-2; Mm00465877_m1), ryanodine receptor 3 (RyR-3; Mm01328421_m1), and 18S ribosomal RNA (4319413E). On the basis of data from a previous study where no ryanodine receptor 1 mRNA expression was detected in mesenteric arteries from hindlimb-unloaded rats (12), we elected only to probe for changes in RyR-2 and RyR-3 mRNA. PSS contained (in mM) 145 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 1.2 NaH2PO4, 1.17 MgSO4, 2.0 CaCl2, 5.0 glucose, 2.0 pyruvate, 0.025 EDTA, and 3.0 MOPS, with pH 7.4. PSS was supplemented with bovine serum albumin (BSA; 1 g/100 ml; USB Corp., Cleveland, OH, USA) and passed through a 0.22-μm cellulose acetate filter (430015; Corning, Corning, NY, USA). Ca2+-free PSS preparation was identical except for the addition of 2 mM EDTA, the replacement of CaCl2with 2.0 mM NaCl, and the exclusion of BSA. KCl and NE stock solutions were prepared in PSS. Caffeine (15 mM) was prepared in Ca2+-free PSS. Intraluminal diameters were measured in micrometers and expressed as a percentage of vasoconstriction as follows: whereDbis the initial baseline intraluminal diameter measured before experimental intervention, andDssis the steady-state intraluminal diameter measured after agonist addition. Spontaneous tone was expressed as a percentage of the maximal diameter (Dm) as follows: The significance of differences in body mass, vessel characteristics, and mRNA levels were determinedviaStudent's unpairedttests. Pressure-response and concentration-response curves were evaluated by using repeated-measures analysis of variance with one within (intraluminal pressure or agonist concentration) and one between (experimental groups) factor. Planned contrasts were conducted at each intraluminal pressure or concentration level to determine whether differences existed between experimental groups (GCvs.SF). All values are presented as means ±se. An α level of 0.05 delineated significance. For STS-131 mice, total body mass was not different between GC and SF mice (22.0±0.4vs.20.9±0.7 g, respectively). Total body mass of STS-133 GC mice (21.7±0.2 g) was greater than that of SFR+1 (18.7±0.3 g) and SFR+5 (20.3±0.1 g) mice, but not different from that of SFR+7 (20.6±0.7 g) mice. And total body mass of STS-135 mice was not different between groups (GC: 19.7±0.5 g; SF: 19.4±1.4 g). Right soleus muscle mass was greater in GC than SF mice in both the STS-131 (GC: 13.5±0.6 mg; SF: 10.4±0.4 mg) and STS-135 (GC: 6.0±0.3 mg; SF: 4.6±0.1 mg) missions; soleus muscle mass was not obtained from STS-133 animals. Values are means ±sefor vessels from mice associated with the STS-131 (GC:n=11; SF:n=11), STS-133 (GC:n=10; SF:R+1,n=2;R+5,n=2;R+7,n=2) and STS-135 (GC:n=9; SF:n=3) space shuttle missions;n= number of animals studied. Mesenteric artery vasoconstrictor responses NE produced a dose-dependent increase in vasoconstriction of mesenteric arteries from both GC and SF animals (Fig. 1A). The vasoconstriction induced by NE was lower in the arteries from SFvs.GC (Fig. 1A). When quantifying temporal vasoconstrictor responses of mesenteric arteries to 10−4M NE, both groups demonstrated a delay followed by a monoexponential decrease in lumen diameter. The monoexponential model provided a superb fit, as demonstrated by a high correlation coefficient (GC:r=0.983±0.006; SF:r=0.946±0.042). The speed of vasoconstriction was markedly slower in the SF group, resulting in a doubling in the time taken to reach a steady-state diameter after exposure to NE (GC: 10.0±2.5 s; SF: 20.6±5.6 s;P< 0.05). Arteries from the SF mice demonstrated a prolonged MRT (i.e., time delay + time constant;Fig. 1B) as well as an ∼50% reduction in the rate of vasoconstriction (Δ vasoconstriction ÷ time constant;Fig. 1B)vs.the GC response.

Increases in KCl concentration produced dose-dependent decrease in luminal diameter of mesenteric arteries from both groups; however, constriction evoked by KCl was lower in arteries from SF mice (Fig. 2A). Spaceflight did not alter active myogenic responses to pressure changes (Fig. 2B) or affect the passive-pressure response characteristics of mesenteric arteries (Fig. 2B).

Venoconstriction to NE was lower in veins from SF mice (Fig. 5A).

Mechanistic basis for diminished arterial vasoconstriction To elucidate potential mechanisms of reduced vasoconstriction after spaceflight, vasoconstrictor responses that occur through discrete mechanisms were determined. NE and KCl cause vasoconstriction through both the influx of extracellular Ca2+and intracellular Ca2+release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (32–34). In contrast, myogenic vasoconstriction appears to be more dependent on extracellular Ca2+for smooth muscle contraction (35–38). Several studies have shown that while mobilization of intracellular Ca2+stores may occur during myogenic vasoconstriction (39), release of intracellular Ca2+is not an essential component for this vasoconstriction to occur (37,38). Therefore, the differential effects of spaceflight to impair vasoconstriction elicited through both NE (Fig. 1A) and KCl (Fig. 2A), but notviaa myogenic response (Fig. 2B), could reflect a deficit in intracellular Ca2+release. To test this possibility, caffeine-induced vasoconstriction, which occurs through an intracellular Ca2+-release mechanism (32–34), was measured. The finding of a lower caffeine-mediated vasoconstriction of arteries from SF mice (Fig. 3A) suggests that microgravity adversely affects elevations in smooth muscle cell cytosolic Ca2+levels through an impaired sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-release mechanism. This conclusion is supported by the findings of reduced RyR-2 (Fig. 3B) and RyR-3 (Fig. 3C) mRNA levels in the mesenteric arteries from SF mice. These ryanodine receptor subtypes are important for intracellular release of Ca2+in smooth muscle cells (40,41). Numerous ground-based studies using HU rats to simulate the effects of microgravity have found deficits in arterial vasoconstriction, including those of the abdominal and thoracic aorta (42–46), pulmonary arteries (47), femoral arteries (46,48,49), skeletal muscle arterioles (22,50) and mesenteric arteries (12,13,51,52). In mesenteric arteries, Colleranet al.(12) demonstrated lower NE-, KCl-, and caffeine-induced vasoconstriction, as well as decreased RyR-2 mRNA and protein after 14 d of HU. In addition, ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum is decreased in vascular smooth muscle cells isolated from mesenteric arteries of HU rats (53). Thus, the mechanism of the microgravity-induced impairment of mesenteric artery vasoconstrictor responsiveness in the present study appears to be consistent with that of ground-based studies with HU rats. Alternative mechanisms have been proposed to underlie reductions in responsiveness of central arteries to NE, including enhanced endothelial-dependent vasodilation (offsetting vasoconstriction), and atrophic vascular remodeling resulting in a reduction in medial wall thickness and medial cross-sectional area. With regard to the first alternatively proposed mechanism, it is possible that arterial hyporesponsiveness to NE with simulated microgravity involves up-regulation of the endothelial NO/cGMP pathway, as differences in vasoconstriction were abolished with the ablation of the endothelial cell lining or inhibition of nitric oxide synthase activity (42,47). However, Delpet al.(44) and Sanghaet al.(48) have demonstrated in the abdominal aorta that the impairment of vasoconstriction persists regardless of whether the endothelium is removed or intact. And in perhaps the most relevant study, Hattonet al.(30) demonstrated an attenuated relaxation to the endothelium-dependent vasodilator acetylcholine in mesenteric arteries of rats after spaceflight, suggesting that endothelium-derived NO bioavailability is depressed rather than enhanced in arteries showing reduced vasoconstrictor responsiveness to NE. Mechanistic basis for diminished venous constriction Time course of arterial recovery from spaceflight Functional ramifications of vasomotor alterations Stroke volume has been shown to be diminished during orthostasis following spaceflight (5,15). Because stroke volume is affected by cardiac contractility and venous filling pressure, a blunting of the magnitude and rate of arterial vasoconstriction would not only affect PVR, but also compromise central venous filling pressure by increasing the volume of blood located within peripheral arterioles, venules, and small veins (71). Given the prodigious vascular capacitance of the splanchnic region (16), a diminished mesenteric vasoconstriction after spaceflight in humans could impair central mobilization of blood volume to support stroke volume and cardiac output. Indeed, a compromised ability to lower perfusion of splanchnic areas during lower-body negative pressure has been shown to occur following prolonged bedrest (10,11). Intact vasoconstrictor mechanisms are also required for the redistribution of cardiac output away from visceral tissue to active skeletal muscles during exercise (71,72). Thus, an impaired ability to reduce visceral blood flow in HU rats (14,51) would adversely affect aerobic capacity and exercise tolerance. Therefore, dysfunction of vaso- and venoconstrictor mechanisms within the splanchnic vasculature in astronauts likely plays a fundamental role in the altered hemodynamics during exercise and orthostasis upon return to Earth. These studies were originally flown on space shuttle mission STS-107, on which the orbiterColumbiatragically disintegrated during its return flight to Earth. This manuscript is dedicated to the STS-107 crew, who were willing to risk their lives to advance our understanding of the effects of microgravity on human health.
