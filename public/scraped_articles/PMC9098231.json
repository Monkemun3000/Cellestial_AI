Wang, School of Pharmacy, University of Southern California, 1985 Zonal Ave Rm 406A, Los Angeles, CA, 90089-9121, Phone: (323) 442-1670,clayw@usc.edu The first global genomic, proteomic, and secondary metabolomic characterization of the filamentous fungusAspergillus nidulansfollowing growth onboard the International Space Station (ISS) is reported. The investigation included theA. nidulanswild-type and 3 mutant strains, two of which were genetically engineered to enhance secondary metabolite production. Whole genome sequencing revealed that ISS conditions altered theA. nidulansgenome in specific regions. In strain CW12001, which features overexpression of the secondary metabolite global regulatorlaeA, ISS conditions induced the loss of thelaeAstop codon. Differential expression of proteins involved in stress response, carbohydrate metabolic processes, and secondary metabolite biosynthesis was also observed. ISS conditions significantly decreased prenyl xanthone production in the wild-type strain and increased asperthecin production in LO1362 and CW12001, which are deficient in a major DNA repair mechanism. These data provide valuable insights into the adaptation mechanism ofA. nidulansto spacecraft environments. It has been well documented that fungal populations persist in extreme conditions, such as various temperatures and pH (López-Archilla et al. 2001;Amaral Zettler et al. 2002;Onofri et al. 2007;de Crecy et al. 2009;Gunde-Cimerman et al. 2009), desiccation (Barnard et al. 2013), ionizing radiation (Dadachova and Casadevall 2008;Tkavc et al. 2018), Mars-like conditions (de la Torre Noetzel et al. 2018;Onofri et al. 2018a;Onofri et al. 2018b), and the spacecraft environment (Onofri et al. 2008;Checinska et al. 2015). Through adaptation, fungi have developed the capacity to sense and respond to external stimuli, enabling their survival in a wide variety of ecological niches (Onofri et al. 2007;Onofri et al. 2008;Dadachova and Casadevall 2008;de Crecy et al. 2009;Checinska et al. 2015). These omnipresent microorganisms can be both beneficial and detrimental to human health, as fungi produce a myriad of secondary metabolites (SMs) in response to environmental stressors with activities ranging from therapeutic to toxic (Segal 2009;Newman and Cragg 2012;Sharpe et al. 2015). SMs have had a tremendous impact on human health, as the majority of small-molecule drugs introduced between 1981 and 2010 were either SMs, SM derivatives, SM mimics, or possessed a SM pharmacophore. In fact, approximately 49% of all anticancer drugs are SMs or were inspired by SMs (Newman and Cragg 2012). Fungi are also potent producers of enzymes, and therefore have various industrial applications (Vries and Visser 2001;MacCabe et al. 2002). We are on the cusp of significant advances in human interplanetary space exploration, as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) aims to send humans back to the Moon and subsequently to Mars in the 2030s. In entering this new era of human spaceflight, a thorough understanding of how fungi respond and adapt to the various stimuli encountered while in space will play an important role in ensuring a health living environment for crew-members. Further, such studies enable the evaluation of fungi as drug production hosts during these exploration class missions, as fungi currently play an indispensable role in pharmaceutical biotechnology on Earth. Fungi residing onboard the International Space Station (ISS) are exposed to microgravity and increased levels of radiation due to being outside of Earth’s protective atmosphere (Horneck et al. 2010). Microgravity is thought to decrease the transfer of extracellular nutrients and metabolic by-products, which may alter the chemical environment that the cell is exposed to (Horneck et al. 2010;Huang et al. 2018). Radiation alters biological processes by acting as a promoter of mutagenesis, which may result in an increased rate of biological evolution leading to the development of adaptive responses (Horneck et al. 2006). Although it has been established that fungi are ubiquitous in spacecraft environments (Pierson 2001;Novikova et al. 2006;Van Houdt et al. 2012;Venkateswaran et al. 2014;Checinska et al. 2015), our understanding of how fungi respond and adapt to the various conditions encountered during spaceflight remains in its infancy (Council 2011). The objective of this study was to investigate the changes encountered in various aspects of fungal “omics” under ISS conditions using the well-characterized organismAspergillus nidulans. Of 30 distinct fungal species retrieved from ISS habitat surfaces during one microbial monitoring study,Aspergilluswas the dominant genus, featuring a diverse population of 13 species, withA. nidulansbeing one of four fungal species isolated from both surfaces and air onboard the ISS (Novikova et al. 2006). Of particular interest is how the space environment alters secondary metabolism, as fungal SM production is highly variable and dependent on external stimuli (Haas 2015).A. nidulansis an extensively studied model organism and in the last decade many of the genes and regulatory networks involved in SM formation have been characterized (Yaegashi et al. 2014). This new information enabled a comprehensive investigation into genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic alterations in response to the space environment. Herein, we report the multi-omic characterization of wild-type (WT)A. nidulansFGSC A4 and three mutant strains, displayed inSupplemental Table S1, following 4 and 7 days of growth onboard the ISS and compared to ground counterparts (Fig. 1). The first mutant strain, LO1362, is theA. nidulans nkuAdeletion strain, which is a homolog of the human KU70 gene. These genes are crucial for non-homologous end joining of DNA double strand break repair, and therefore deletion ofnkuAdisrupts a major DNA repair mechanism inA. nidulans(Krappmann 2007). The second mutant strain, LO8158, is deficient inmcrA, which is a negative regulator of at least 10 SM gene clusters (Oakley et al. 2017). Deletion of this gene stimulates SM production while impairing fungal growth. The final mutant strain used in this study was anA. nidulans laeAoverexpression mutant, CW12001. LaeA is a global positive regulator of secondary metabolism, and therefore overexpression oflaeAincreases the production levels of a number of SMs (Bok and Keller 2004). ISS- and Earth-grown strains were subjected to genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses with the aim to identify genetic and molecular alterations that occur in fungi in response to exposure to the space environment that could pave the way to new discoveries that could benefit human spaceflight and people on Earth. Schematic overview of theA. nidulansISS experiment. TheA. nidulanswild-type (FGSC A4) and three mutant strains (LO1362, LO8158, and CW12001) were seeded onto GMM agar Omnitray plates and integrated into PHAB systems. Samples were transported to the ISS at 4°C, where they remained for approximately 26 or 23 days until being subjected to growth in SABL systems at 37°C for either 4 or 7 days, respectively. Earth-grown PHABs were simultaneously transferred to on-ground containers mimicking ISS SABL systems. Following growth, all samples were subjected to 4°C and ISS-grown samples were transported to Earth. All samples were subjected to genomic, proteomic, and metabolomics analyses. Strains, media, and growth conditions The WTA. nidulansFGSC A4 strain was obtained from the Fungal Genetics Stock Center (McCluskey et al. 2010). LO1362 and LO8158 were obtained from previous studies (Oakley et al. 2017). ThelaeAoverexpression strain (CW12001) was generated using the constitutivegpdApromoter according to standard protocol (Hunter et al. 1992). Protoplast production, construction of fusion PCR products, and transformation were carried out as described previously (Szewczyk et al. 2006;Nayak et al. 2006). Primers used are listed inTable S2and correct transformants were verified using diagnostic PCR. Genomic DNA extraction, library preparation, and genome sequencing Mycelia was collected from Earth-grown (7-day) and space-grown (4- and 7-day) GMM agar Omnitrays for all strains (FGSC A4, LO1362, LO8158, and CW12001), frozen with liquid nitrogen, and ground using a mortar and pestle. DNA was extracted using the Mo Bio PowerMax Soil DNA Isolation Kit (Mo Bio Laboratories, Carlsbad, California, USA) according to the manufacturers protocol. Library preparation and whole genome sequencing were performed at the Duke Center for Genomic and Computational Biology (Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, USA). DNA quality and quantity were checked using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer DNA assay (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, California, USA) and Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). The library was prepared for paired-end sequencing using the TruSeq Nano DNA Library Preparation Kit (Illumina, San Diego, California, USA). Samples were sequenced using a HiSeq 4000 Illumina Sequencer and 101 base read lengths were generated. Genetic mutation identification Illumina sequence reads were trimmed using Trimmomatic v 0.36 (Bolger et al. 2014) and quality was checked using FastQC v 0.11.7 (Andrews 2010). The genome and annotation files forA. nidulansFGSC A4 (Galagan et al. 2005) were downloaded from the FungiDB web portal (Stajich et al. 2012). Reads were mapped to the FGSC A4 reference genome using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) software package v 0.7.12 (Li and Durbin 2009), and further processed with SAMtools v 1.6 to generate sorted BAM files (Li et al. 2009). SNPs and indels were identified using GATK v 3.7 (DePristo et al. 2011). Duplicates were marked using Picard-tools MarkDuplicates (https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/) to remove PCR artifacts. Sequence reads containing putative indels were realigned using GATK’s IndelRealigner to generate an updated BAM file. Variants within each sample were called using GATK’s Haplotype Caller, and the resulting Variant Call Format (VCF) files were combined using GATK’s Genotype GVCFs so that there was one VCF file for each strain (4 in total). GATK’s VariantFiltration was used to filter each VCF file based on stringent cutoffs for quality and coverage {SNPs: QD <2.0, MQ <40.0, QUAL <100, FS >60.0, MQRankSum <−12.5, SOR >4.0, ReadPosRankSum <−8.0; Indels: QD <2.0, FS >200.0, MQRankSum <−12.5, SOR >4, InbreedingCoeff <−0.8, ReadPosRankSum <−20.0}, so that only high-quality variants remained. Mycelia was collected from Earth-grown (7-day) and space-grown (4- and 7-day) GMM agar Omnitrays for all strains (FGSC A4, LO1362, LO8158, and CW12001), frozen with liquid nitrogen, and ground using a mortar and pestle. For protein extraction, the lysis buffer consisted of 100 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB) with 1X Halt Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (100X) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) and 1mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, USA). The frozen ground mycelia were transferred and subjected to a Precellys 24 homogenizer (Bertin Instruments, Rockville, Maryland, USA) in which each sample was processed inside a 2-mL cryotube with 1.0 mm glass beads for three times (at 4°C, 6500 rpm, 1 min., repeated 3 times with 15 s pauses in between). The lysed cells were centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 15 min. Protein concentrations in the supernatants were measured by a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. Hercules, California, USA). Tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling About 200 μg proteins from each sample were precipitated in 20% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) at 4°C. Protein pellets were obtained by centrifugation (17,000 g), washed with ice-cold acetone, and resuspended in 25μL TEAB (100 mM) and 25μL 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE). Proteins were reduced by adding 1μL of tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP, 500 mM) and incubated for 1 hour at 37 °C (10 mM final TCEP concentration). Proteins were alkylated in presence of iodoacetamide (IAA, 30 mM) in the dark for 1 hour at room temperature. 2.5 μg per sample of mass spec grade trypsin/lysC (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, USA) was used to digest the peptides overnight at 37 °C. The digested peptides were quantified using the Pierce Quantitative Colorimetric Peptide Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). 40 μg of peptides from each sample was labeled with the Thermo Scientific TMT 6-plex (TMT6) Isobaric Mass Tagging Kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The TMT6-130 label was used as either 4 day or 7 day strains’ reference that contained 5 μg of peptides from each of the 8 strain. The TMT6-131 label was used as a total mixture reference that contained 2.5 μg of peptides from each of the 16 strains. All six labeled-peptide mixtures were combined into a single tube, mixed, and fractionated using the Pierce High pH Reversed-Phase Peptide Fractionation Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). While this kit usually uses only eight fractions with step elution of up to 50% acetonitrile, we added a ninths fraction eluting at 100% acetonitrile. Nine fractionated samples were dried using a SpeedVac concentrator and re-suspended in 1% formic acid prior to LC-MS/MS analysis. The samples were analyzed on an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer with an EASYnLC 1000 Liquid Chromatograph, a 75 μm x 2 cm Acclaim PepMap100 C18 trapping column, a 75 μm x 25 cm PepMap RSLC C18 analytical column, and an Easy-Spray ion source (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). The column temperature was maintained at 45 °C and the peptides were eluted at a flow rate of 300 nL/min over a 110 min gradient, from 3–30% solvent B (100 min), 30–50% solvent B (3 min), 50–90% solvent B (2 min), and 90% solvent B (2 min). The solvent A was 0.1 % formic acid in water and the solvent B was 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. The full MS survey scan (m/z 400–1500) was acquired in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 120,000 and with an automatic gain control (AGC) target of 2×105. The maximum injection time for MS scans was 50 ms. Monoisotopic precursor ions were selected with charge states 2–7 with a ±10 ppm mass window using a 70 s dynamic exclusion. The MS2scan (m/z 400–2000) was performed using the linear ion trap with the CID collision energy set to 35 %. The ion trap scan rate was set to “rapid”, with an AGC target of 4×103, and a maximum injection time of 150 ms. Ten fragment ions from each MS2experiment were subsequently simultaneously selected for an MS3experiment. The MS3scan (m/z 100–500) was performed to generate the TMT reporter ions in the linear ion trap using HCD at a collision energy setting of 55 %, a rapid scan rate and an AGC target of 5×103, and a maximum injection time of 250 ms. Quantitative proteomics analysis All MS/MS spectra were analyzed using the Proteome Discoverer v 2.2.0.388 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) with the Sequest-HT searching engines against anAspergillus nidulansFGSC A4 database containing 10,525 protein group sequences based on the annotated genome (NCBI, BioProject PRJEA40559, Assembly GCA_000011425.1, Release date 2009/09/24). The search was performed with the following parameters: 2 maximum missed cleavage sites, 6 minimum peptide length, 5 ppm tolerance for precursor ion masses, and 0.6 Da tolerance for fragment ion masses. The static modification settings included carbamidomethyl of cysteine residues and dynamic modifications included oxidation of methionine, TMT6plex modification of lysine ε-amino groups and peptide N-termini, and acetyl modification of protein N-terminus. A false discovery rate (FDR) of 1% for peptides and proteins was obtained using a target-decoy database search. The reporter ions integration tolerance was 0.5 Da while the coisolation threshold was 75%. The average signal-to-noise threshold of all reported peaks was greater than 10. The quantitative abundance of each protein is determined from the total intensity of the detected reporter ions. The ratios between reporter and the reference reporter ion (TMT6- 131) were used to estimate the abundance ratio of each protein. Secondary metabolite extraction and analysis Organic compounds were extracted by taking 3 plugs of fungal-grown agar and extracting with 3 ml methanol (MeOH), followed by 3 ml 1:1 MeOH-dichloromethane, each with 1 hour of sonication and filtration. The extract was evaporatedin vacuousing a rotary evaporator, re-dissolved in 250 μl of 20% dimethyl sulfoxide in MeOH, and a portion (10 μl) was examined by high performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array detection-mass spectroscopy (HPLCDAD-MS) analysis. HPLC-MS was carried out using a ThermoFinnigan LCQ Advantage ion trap mass spectrometer with a reverse-phase C18 column (3 μm; 2.1 by 100 μm; Alltech Prevail) at a flow rate of 125 μl/min. The solvent gradient for HPLC-DAD-MS was 95% MeCN/H2O (solvent B) in 5% MeCN/H2O (solvent A) both containing 0.05% formic acid, as follows: 0% solvent B from 0 to 5 min, 0 to 100% solvent B from 5 min to 35 min, 100 to 0% solvent B from 40 to 45 min, and re-equilibration with 0% solve B from 45 to 50 min. For quantification, positive-ion electrospray ionization (ESI) was used for the detection of austinol, dehydroaustinol, sterigmatocystin, nidulanin A and analogues, emericellamides A and C-F, emericellin, shamixanthone, and epishamixanthone. Negative-ion ESI was used for the detection of asperthecin, terrequinone, and sterigmatocystin intermediate. Relative production levels were quantified by integrating the area under each SM’s ESI trace. Raw WGS data for ISS-grownA. nidulansstrains and ground-grown counterparts are available in the NCBI SRA under accession numbers SRR7724113- SRR7724124 and BioProject accession number PRJNA486827. Proteomics data is accessible through the ProteomeXchange Consortium via PRIDE with the dataset identifier PXD010778.

Significance was determined using Welch’s t-test.cChemical structure of asperthecin. Although the persistence of fungi within space vessels is well-documented and unavoidable (Novikova 2004;Novikova et al. 2006;Checinska et al. 2015), little is understood about how fungi respond and adapt to spacecraft conditions, such as microgravity and enhanced radiation. To date, most microbiological studies conducted in such environments have focused on changes occurring within bacteria or the microbiome as a whole (Tixador et al. 1985;Wilson et al. 2008;Checinska et al. 2015;Mora et al. 2016;Huang et al. 2018). Additionally, despite the various therapeutic and industrial applications of SMs, few studies have analyzed the global influence of space conditions on fungal secondary metabolism, as previous investigations have often focused on the production of a single SM (Lam et al. 1998;Lam et al. 2002;Benoit et al. 2006). Therefore, with the duration of space missions expected to increase, a major goal of this study was to investigate space-induced alternations in fungal ‘omics’ to identify specific adaptation biomarkers and acquire insight into potential benefits of fungi that may not be discernable using traditional methodology. Correlations linking genomic and proteomic data were observed with the two strains genetically engineered to increase SM production. Expsoure to the space environment appeared to curtail enhanced SM production in thelaeAoverexpression strain through the introduction of a point mutation that resulted in loss of thelaeAstop codon, thereby activating nonstop decay degradation oflaeAmRNA (Hoof et al. 2002;Klauer and van Hoof 2012). The ISS-induced down-regulation oflaeAwas also observed in the proteome of those samples, which exhibited an expression profile opposite that of themcrAdeletion strain for many proteins. Proteins involved in SM biosynthesis pathways regulated bylaeAexhibited decreased and increased abundance in ISS-grown CW12001 and LO8158, respectively. The extensively studied protein LaeA forms a nuclear complex with VeA and VelB that coordinates secondary metabolism regulation with fungal development (Bayram et al. 2010). LaeA is often referred to as a global regulator of secondary metabolism (Bok and Keller 2016), and has been reported to also influence proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism and oxidative stress response (Lv et al. 2018). Accordingly, several proteins involved in carbohydrate and antioxidant metabolic processes exhibited opposite protein expression profiles in LO8158 and CW12001. Regulation bylaeAhas been reported for some of these proteins inA. flavus, including endo-1,4-beta-xylanase, betaglycoside, endo-beta-1,4-glucanase, and oxidative stress response proteins CatA and GstB (Lv et al. 2018). These findings verify the extensive regulatory role oflaeAand highlight the complexity involved in identifying thelaeA-controlled processes responsible for conferring selective advantage of the observedlaeAstop lost mutation. This is compounded by reports thatlaeAalso alters chromatin remodeling, cell growth and metabolism, conidiogenesis, conidialchain elongation, sporulation, pigmentation and colony hydrophobicity in various fungal species (Kosalková et al. 2009;Chang et al. 2012;Brakhage 2013;Lv et al. 2018). It is also possible that curtailinglaeAoverexpression is favored in ISS conditions to reduce energy expenditures in a stressful environment. ISS conditions significantly increased production of asperthecin, an anthraquinone pigment, in LO1362 and CW12001. Both mutants are deficient in NkuA production, which facilitates non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) DNA repair, the favored DNA double strand break repair pathway in filamentous fungi (Krappmann 2007). We had anticipated that NkuA deficient strains would be particularly interesting in flight studies due to impairment of a preferred DNA repair pathway in a mutagenic, high-radiation environment. Additionally, deletion of thenkuAhomolog has been reported to increase sensitivity toward gamma irradiation in other fungal species (Meyer et al. 2007). Although we cannot discriminate the specific ISS condition that induced asperthecin production in LO1362, we hypothesize that it served as an alternative protective mechanism from the high levels of radiation present on the ISS. Our observation stays in agreement with other reports suggesting that pigment production is a key adaptive response of fungi exposed to similar environments (Volz and Dublin 1973;Singaravelan et al. 2008;Dadachova and Casadevall 2008). It is therefore possible that asperthecin can be used to protect other forms of life present on the spacecraft. Only a small proportion of proteins were differentially expressed in ISS-grownA. nidulanssamples, which emphasizes the potential and safety ofA. nidulansas a therapeutic production host during outer space missions. This finding may not hold true across theAspergillusgenus, as increased virulence has been reported inAspergillus fumigatusstrains isolated from the ISS (Knox et al. 2016). Currently, if pharmaceutical stocks in space are depleted, a small, unmanned spacecraft is launched to restock crew supplies. In the era of long-term space travel, the duration of future space missions is expected to drastically increase. The inability to deliver required drugs to astronauts in a timely manner could result in serious complications. Through heterologous expression of specific genes,A. nidulansintroduces the ability to biosynthesize a wide range of pharmaceutical drugs within a week, which could significantly improve astronauts’ safety during long-term manned space missions. In summary, this work has revealed the multi-omic response of the well-characterized model filamentous fungus, A. nidulans, to spacecraft conditions. These findings illustrate the potential of asperthecin to confer radiation resistance and ofA. nidulansto be utilized as a small molecule production host in space. Further, specific genetic mutations involved in the adaptive mechanism of fungi in space environments were identified. Such knowledge may be valuable to NASA’s Space Biology Program (https://www.nasa.gov/spacebio) in planning for future outer space explorations.
