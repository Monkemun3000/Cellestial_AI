Parasitoid wasps serve as biological control agents of agricultural insect pests and are worthy of study. Many parasitic wasps develop inside their hosts to emerge as free-living adults. To overcome the resistance of their hosts, parasitic wasps use varied and ingenious strategies such as mimicry, evasion, bioactive venom, virus-like particles, viruses, and extracellular vesicles (EVs). We describe the effects of a unique class of EVs containing virulence proteins and produced in the venom of wasps that parasitize fruit flies ofDrosophilaspecies. EVs fromLeptopilina heterotomaare widely distributed throughout theDrosophilahosts’ circulatory system after infection. They enter and kill macrophages by destroying the very same subcellular machinery that facilitates their uptake. An important protein in this process, Rab5, is needed to maintain the identity of the macrophage; when Rab5 function is reduced, macrophages turn into a different cell type called lamellocytes. Activities in the EVs can eliminate lamellocytes as well. EVs also interfere with the hosts’ genetic program that promotes lamellocyte differentiation needed to block parasite development. Thus, wasps combine specific preemptive and reactive strategies to deplete their hosts of the very cells that would otherwise sequester and kill them. These findings have applied value in agricultural pest control and medical therapeutics. Parasitoid (parasitic) wasps have an obligatory relationship with their insect hosts. Engaged in a biological “arms race,” each partner continuously adapts to the other to emerge alive. For reproductive success, parasitic wasps target their hosts’ behavior, development and immune system. Their attack mechanisms range from biochemical warfare and mimicry, to passive evasion and active immune suppression [1–3].Drosophilaand their parasitic wasps are an emerging model for studying how wasps evade or suppress host defenses [4,5]. The generalistLeptopilina heterotoma(Lh) succeeds on theDrosophilaspecies within and beyond the melanogaster group. Its close relative,L.boulardi(Lb), considered a specialist, mainly infects flies of the melanogaster group. Both wasps are highly successful onD.melanogaster; they consume its developing larval and pupal stages to emerge as free-living adults [6]. Oviposition into second-to-early-thirdD.melanogasterlarval hosts byLbandLhwasps yields divergent immunological effects.Lbinfection activates many components of humoral and cellular immunity: Toll-NF-κB, JAK-STAT, and the melanization pathways and their target genes are transcriptionally upregulated; there is a burst of hematopoietic proliferation and differentiation of blood cells (also called hemocytes) in the lymph gland and in circulation. If the immune responses are strong and sustained, macrophages and lamellocytes encapsulate and kill wasp eggs [7–11].Lhinfection in contrast suppresses immune gene expression and kills immature and mature larval hemocytes [12,13]. LbandLhfemales (and alsoL.victoriae, a sister species ofLh) produce discrete immune-suppressive extracellular vesicle- (EV) like structures in their venom glands (called multi-strategy extracellular vesicles, MSEVs inLhand venosomes inLb) [14,15]. Previously called virus like particles [16–18], these EVs lack clear viral features [15,19]. They are produced in the venom gland, a structure made up of the long gland and a reservoir. The secretory cells of the long gland synthesize and secrete proteins, some of which are initially incorporated into discrete non-spiked vesicle-like structures. In sister speciesLhandLv, these structures mature in the reservoir and assume a stellate morphology with 4–8 spikes radiating from the center. Mature EVs are roughly 300 nm in diameter, [14,16,20–22]. Packed with more than 150 proteins, EVs are, in part, responsible for divergent physiological outcomes in infected hosts [15,19,23]. Among the most abundant in theLhEV proteins is a 40 kDa surface/spike protein (SSp40) [20]. SSp40 shares structural similarities with the IpaD/SipD family of proteins of the gastroenteric disease-causing Gram negative bacteria,ShigellaandSalmonella[15]. Similar to SSp40’s localization toLhEV spike tips, IpaD localizes to the tips of the T3 secretion injectisome, a bacterial transfer system that injects virulence proteins into mammalian cells. IpaD itself promotes apoptosis of mammalian macrophages [24,25]. These parallels betweenLhSSp40 and bacterial IpaD/SipD suggest thatLhEVs may share some similarities with bacterial secretion systems. Comparative transcriptomic/proteomic approaches revealed that SSp40 and a few other EV proteins are not expressed in theLbvenom [15]. WhereasLhEVs lyse lamellocytes within a few hours of wasp attack,LbEVs do not have the same effect [7,16,26]. Our immune-inhibition experiments suggested thatLh’s SSp40 mediates EV interactions with lamellocytes [20].Lhinfection also uniquely promotes apoptosis of larval macrophages and of lymph gland hemocytes [13]. Macrophages make up more than 95% of all hematopoietic cells while differentiated lamellocytes are rarely found in naïve hosts [8–10,27]. Work in the field strongly suggests that the protein activities concentrated within theLhEVs are responsible for the destruction of these mature and immature blood cells. However, how a macro-endoparasite targets the hematopoietic system and accesses its progenitor population has not been studied. The modes ofLhEV entry into these cells and the pathways of destruction are also not well understood. The goal of this study was to obtain a macro-level view ofLhEV interactions with cells of the larval hemolymphatic system after infection. The term hemolymph refers to the interstitial fluid that distributes hormones, peptides and other macromolecules into organs through the pumping action of an unbranched tubular heart, or the dorsal vessel. Dozens of macrophages circulate in the hemolymph. The heart lumen is surrounded by a column of paired cardiomyocytes and associated pericardial cells. This tubular structure is held in place by alary muscles [28–30]. Hematopoietic cells are organized in paired cell clusters (or lobes) on the dorsal vessel. In third instar larvae, the anterior-most lobes have blood cells at various stages of differentiation; the least differentiated progenitors are confined adjacent to the dorsal vessel, whereas the developing macrophages are sequestered in the cortical regions of the lobes (Fig 1A). In naïve hosts, the progenitor state is maintained by a putative niche (also called the posterior signaling center, PSC). The PSC is a tight unit of about 25–50 cells and is positioned posteriorly to the progenitors [31,32]. UponLbinfection, the PSC reprograms hematopoiesis inducing macrophage and lamellocyte differentiation [30,32–39]. The entire structure is covered by the acellular basement membrane [28,40]. Fig 1.LhEVs associate with the larval lymphatic system. (A) Anterior lobes (ALs, without lamellocytes) from a naïveAntp>mCD8GFP Dome-MESO-GFP(AntpDMG) animal shows medullary zone (MZ), cortical zone (CZ) and posterior signaling center (PSC).

(B-D) Anterior lobes from uninfected (UI;B),Lb- andLh-infected (C, D)Antp>mCD8GFPanimals.Lb17infection induces lamellocyte differentiation in the cortex (lamellocytes are larger than their progenitors and are rich in F-actin). The GFP-positive PSC appears unaffected.Lh14attack leads to loss of lobe cells; the PSC cells are not tightly-clustered and displaced from their original location. (E-K) Lymph glands fromPxn>GFPanimals. (E) GFP is expressed in the cortex of uninfected animals, but GFP expression is reduced after wasp attack (F-H).Lh14-infected ALs from the same infection experiment showing variability in loss of cells;LhEVs (anti-SSp40 staining, referred to as p40 here and in remaining figures) are seen in some cells of these lobes and within the dorsal vessel. (I-K) Posterior lobes from uninfected (I) andLh-infected animals (J, K). (L) Circulating hemocytes from infected animals. LhEVs are present within the larval lymphatic system Lb17attack triggers lamellocyte differentiation in the larval lymph gland cortex (Fig 1A–1C). At an equivalent time-point,Lh-infected lobes are significantly smaller (Fig 1D–1K); [13]. Surprisingly, unlikeAntp>mCD8GFP-expressing PSCs of naïve andLb-infected lobes that remain tightly clustered (Fig 1A–1C), PSC cells ofLh-infected hosts are dislodged and some are distributed in the body of the lobe (Fig 1D). To understand these responses, we imaged more than 25 hosts in multiple experiments. Throughout these studies, we used a polyclonal antibody to mark SSp40, anLhEV-specific protein [20].Lhinfection ofPxn>GFPanimals reducedPxn>GFPexpression (Fig 1E–1H). (Pxnis normally active in the cortex and its expression mimics that of many other genes downregulated byLhinfection [7]). An abundance ofLhEVs was observed in anterior- and posterior-lobe hemocytes, in the dorsal vessel, and in circulating hemocytes (Fig 1F–1H and 1J–1L). This staining signal is absent in glands from naïve animals (Fig 1E and 1I). Thus,LbandLhattack have drastically different outcomes andLhEVs appear to interact directly with most lymph gland hemocytes. In our analyses across experiments, we found that the degree of tissue loss and EV distribution varies. Lobe morphologies ranged from nearly intact and filled with EVs (Fig 1F and 1J) to damaged lobes, with few to many EVs (Fig 1G, 1H and 1K). This variation is likely due to (a) the duration of infection (i.e., time between oviposition and dissection); (b) the injected EV dose; or (c) the dynamics of EV circulation. Dissections at later time points showed loss of almost all lymph gland hemocytes [13]. To then probe howLhEVs enter the lymphatic system, we stainedLh-infected glands from fly strains with GFP-tagged Collagen IV (basement membrane,Viking[41]) or GFP-tagged proteoglycan core protein, Perlecan/Trol [42]. In both cases, EV puncta were clearly localized with the continuous GFP signals of these extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins along the dorsal vessel as well as in the interstitial spaces around clustered hematopoietic progenitors (yellow puncta inFig 2A–2D’arrows). Surprisingly, punctate staining was also seen inside immature progenitors, adjacent to the dorsal vessel (Fig 2B, 2B’ 2D and 2D’). EVs were also observed inside some cardiomyocytes as evidenced by SSp40 colocalization with the mCD8GFP signal inHandΔ>mCD8GFPlarvae (Fig 2E–2F’, arrows). Thus,LhEVs associate with ECM proteins of the lymphatic system, enter the dorsal vessel lumen and even some cardiomyocytes. Fig 2.LhEVs associate with basement membrane proteins.

Effects ofLhinfection on PSC integrity Previous studies have demonstrated that uponLbinfection, the PSC reprograms hematopoietic development and promotes lamellocyte differentiation. Similar to controls,Lbinfected PSCs remain tightly clustered [35,37,38,43,44]. We found that regardless of theLhstrain, PSC cells dislodged from their normal posterior position into the body of the lobe (Figs1DandS1A and S1B). At the time points we examined, half of the PSC cells relocated into the lobe, of which an overwhelming majority (> 95%) were present as single cells or as groups of two cells. The other half remained in their original place, although some were not as tightly clustered (Figs1DandS1; n = 24 PSCs from 12 lymph glands). As expected, in 14 lobes from naïve controls, all PSC cells were tightly packed. Strikingly, in samples from infected animals, where the PSCs were still intact, EVs congregated in regions adjacent to the PSC, but were never found inside the PSC cells (S1A and S1B Fig). The Slit ligand, originating from adjacent cardiomyocytes, controls PSC integrity via the Robo receptors in the PSC; Robo2 has the strongest effect [45]. Indeed, the effect ofLhinfection on the PSC resemblesSlit/Robo2KD, which promotes PSC disassembly [45] (Figs1andS1). A cohesive PSC is important in hematopoietic development as fewer macrophages and crystal cells develop inSlit/Robo2KD lobes compared to controls. But differing fromLhinfection,SlitKD PSCs are larger and there is no apparent loss of progenitors [45]. In spite of different outcomes in the two conditions, we hypothesized that the initial steps might be shared and thatLhEVs might inactivate the Slit-Robo signal, which might explain PSC disassembly. To test this idea, we infected animals in which the Slit-Robo pathway was manipulated to promote constitutive signaling. We found that neither expressing active Slit nor overexpressing Robo2 alteredLhEVs’ ability to disassemble the PSC.Lhinfection ofHandΔ>Slit-Nanimals still promoted PSC disassembly (S2A–S2C’ Fig; n = 16 lobes) even though gain-of-functionSlit-N[46] reverses the effects ofSlitKD [45]. Similarly,Lhinfection bypassed the effects of Robo2 overexpression (Antp>Robo2-HA) and promoted PSC disassemblyS2D–S2F’ Fig). Many EVs are observed around these PSCs (S3 Fig; n = 16). Thus, either EVs inactivate PSC function independently of the Slit-Robo signal, or they possess redundant mechanisms that disable constitutive Slit-Robo signaling. PSC-less lymph glands remain intact Fig 3. PSC-less lymph glands fromLh-infected animals have intact lobes. (A, D) Lobes from a naïveUAS-Hidhost are intact and lack EVs; anterior (A), and posterior lobes (D). (B, E) Lymph gland from aLh-infectedUAS-Hidhost is depleted of hemocytes and has many EVs. Anterior lobes (B, B’), and posterior lobes (E, E’). (C, F) PSC-less lobes from aLh-infectedCol>Hidhost are intact with weak EV signal. Anterior (C, C’), and posterior lobes (F, F’). The larval lymph gland is phagocytically competent We next studied if EV uptake into hematopoietic cells occurs via RGT mechanisms. InPxn>GFP;+/Bcheterozygous lymph glands, we observed blackened, dead crystal cells in the cytoplasm of the GFP-positive cortical cells (S6 Fig). This observation suggests that GFP-positive lymph gland cells are phagocytically competent. We therefore investigated ifLhEV uptake depends on Rab5, an early endosomal protein. Rab5 mediates trafficking from the plasma membrane to early endosomes [47]. In contrast toPxn>GFPmacrophages, where EV staining is bright and punctate throughout the cytoplasm (Fig 4A and 4B),Pxn>GFP,Rab5RNAicells show peripheral punctate staining, presumably from intact EVs, trapped in early endosomes, both in lymph gland and circulating hemocytes (Fig 4C and 4D; arrows). In lamellocytes, the EV signal is diffuse and nuclear, andRab5KD shows no change in staining intensity or distribution (Fig 4E and 4F; arrowheads), suggesting that Rab5-independent uptake mechanisms are involved.msn-GFP- and integrin-β-positive lamellocyte fragments were also observed inLh-infected macrophages suggesting occurrence of efferocytosis (S7 Fig).

(C, D) An anterior lobe (C-C”) and circulating hemocytes (D-D”) fromLh-infectedPxn>GFP Rab5RNAianimals showing peripheral localization of EVs (arrow). As inFig 1,Pxn>GFPexpression is reduced after wasp attack. Samples were counterstained with FITC-Phalloidin to visualize cell morphology. A larger Phalloidin-positive lamellocyte (arrowhead) remains EV negative, while smaller macrophages endocytose EVs. The EV signal is peripheral in some, but not all macrophages (C, D). (E, F) Anterior l Lobes (E-E”) and circulating hemocytes (F-F”) fromLh-infected GFP-positive lamellocytes ofhopTum-lmsn>mCD8GFP,Rab5RNAianimals. Lamellocytes show a diffuse nuclear SSp40 signal (arrowhead). LhEVs negatively impact phagolysosomal organization in macrophages Rab7 mediates late endosome formation and trafficking between late endosomes and lysosomes is marked by Rab7 and LAMP1, respectively [47]. To evaluate ifLhEVs impact the RGT machinery, infected glands expressing GFP-tagged Rab5, Rab7, or LAMP1 proteins were examined (Fig 5). Under our experimental conditions,LhEVs rarely colocalized with early endosomes and Rab5 compartment morphology remained comparable to uninfected controls (only 14% of SSp40 puncta are Rab5-positive; n = 221 cells; 6 lobes;Fig 5A–5C). In contrast,LhEVs were consistently found with GFP-Rab7 and GFP-LAMP1 and these compartments were grossly distorted (100% co-localization; n = 115 and 112 cells, Rab7 and LAMP, respectively, 6 lobes each;Fig 5D–5E”). Moreover, the Rab7/EV and LAMP1/EV signals were asymmetrically localized inLh-affected cells. In contrast,Lbinfection did not distort LAMP-positive compartments and they retained their normal morphology (Fig 5F and 5G). These observations suggest that high numbers ofLhEVs transit through early endosomes, but that they are retained in late RGT compartments including lysosomes. Thus,LhEVs have a detrimental effect on RGT compartment integrity and this loss of integrity may promote lysosomal leakage and labilization. Fig 5.

Square brackets (D’,D”, E’,E”) point to grossly distorted Rab7 and LAMP1 compartments associated withLhEVs. (F, G)Lbinfection does not distort LAMP1 compartment morphologies. Rab5 suppresses proliferation and maintains the macrophage fate We were surprised to find thatPxn>GFP Rab5RNAianimals developed melanized tumors (S8A and S8B Fig); the hematopoietic population is significantly expanded and lamellocyte differentiation is robust, affecting viability (S8C–S8F Fig). (Variability in viability and tumor development inRab5KD animals is likely due to differences in the strengths and expression patterns of the GAL4 drivers.) A similar result was observed with the expression of the dominant negative Rab5S43N protein which cannot bind GTP [48]).Rab5KD even in the lymph gland medullary zone (TepIV>Rab5RNAi) resulted in lamellocyte differentiation (Fig 6A and 6B).

In panelH, the GFP and integrin-β signals overlap in some cells confirming lamellocyte identity (arrow in inset). System-wide distribution but specific effects ofLhEVs Parasitism byL.heterotomahas been of interest because of its ability to parasitize manyDrosophilahosts and the existence of venom factors that kill host hemocytes.Lblacks these activities (Fig 7). The discovery of an anti-lamellocyte activity intrinsic toLhEVs provided initial insights into the critical roles of these EVs in parasitism [20,49]. However, details underlying their apoptotic effects on macrophages have been lacking. This work provides the first view into howLhEVs rely on the host’s circulation to gain system-wide distribution to not only precisely kill the available effector cells but also to pre-emptively interfere with the host’s ability to produce additional effector cells. We show that lymph glands serve an important, previously unappreciated role in immunity. A majority of lymph gland cells can phagocytoseLhEVs to protect the host from their detrimental effects. EV activities in turn promote their apoptotic death by disrupting their endomembrane system. Fig 7.LhEV interactions and effects on host blood cells: summary of events. Left: Immune suppression byLhandLbwasps and host defense in response to infection. Text in bold indicates findings from this study. Right:Lbattack triggers NF-κB-dependent signaling events in the PSC and promotes lamellocyte differentiation of lymph gland progenitors (left lobe). This process is important in host defense against parasitic wasps [35,44] and is kept in check by Rab5. AfterLhinfection (right lobe),LhMSEVs concentrate around and disassemble the PSC. They are phagocytosed by macrophages by a Rab5-dependent endocytic mechanism. In macrophages, EVs damage the phagolysosomal compartments. They are internalized by lamellocytes independently of Rab5 function. EVs lyse the few lamellocytes that differentiate post infection. This work also lays bare new questions.LhEVs’ association with the ECM proteins around the lymphatic system cells suggests ways in which EVs might recognize and home into the lymph gland hemocytes and cardiomyocytes although the role of the ECM, the details of their entry and physiological effects on cardiomyocytes are currently unclear. As has been suggested for Slit-carrying vesicles [45], cardiac cells might provide a route forLhEVs to converge into the vicinity of the PSCs. Once inside lymph gland hemoctytes, they simultaneously target the protective functions of macrophages and lamellocytes and their activities culminate to strongly block encapsulation (Fig 7). These strategies are not uncommon and are likely to be shared by closely relatedLeptopilinawasps or even unrelated virulent wasps that attack drosophilid and non-drosophilid hosts and are known to destroy their hosts’ hematopoietic cells [50–54]. LhEVs proactively block encapsulation Studies withLbshowed that the lymph gland itself responds to wasp infection and lamellocytes differentiate from hematopoietic progenitors [8,9,55,56]. In addition to PSC’s niche function in naïve animals [31,32,57–59], the PSC also appears to play an anti-parasite role asLbinfection promotes lamellocyte differentiation [30,35–38,43,60]. Given this latter role, it is reasonable to interpretLh’s effects on PSC integrity as part of a corresponding adaptive strategy thatLhhas acquired during its evolutionary history. The highLhEV levels around the PSC and its disassembly provide novel physiological insights into PSC functions and raise intriguing mechanistic questions. A normally clustered and cohesive PSC organization is needed for proper hematopoietic differentiation in naïve animals [45]. AlthoughLhinfection-induced PSC disassembly and hemocyte loss are observed together in fixed samples, our data from infected PSC-less animals suggest that PSC disruption might precede hemocyte death. It is possible that the PSC may somehow “recognize” foreign entities and might serve to protect the progenitor microenvironment by acting as a chemical or mechanical barrier between the vascular and hematopoietic cells. In this scenario,LhEVs may be targeting PSC cohesiveness to inactivate this barrier function. Extracellular vesicles secreted from mammalian neutrophils and endothelial cells can direct cell motility and chemotaxis [61,62]. Thus, it is possible thatLhEV activities [15] are similarly responsible for PSC disassembly. These activities may perturb host pathways required for normal PSC cohesion and function, although manipulating the Slit-Robo pathway components, orhhsignaling, hypothesized to disrupt the infection process, was insufficient to blockLh’s ability to disperse the PSC and attack hemocytes.LhEVs may possess redundant or independent mechanisms to control PSC integrity and this question remains open for further research. A central role for phagocytosis in the anti-parasite response The ability of macrophages to ingest and kill microbes is a fundamental facet of innate immunity. Microbes have evolved to evade or escape the destructive conditions in their host cells’ phagolysosomes. While most intracellular pathogens avoid fusion with lysosomes, others modify endocytic trafficking differently to survive in their host cells [63]. We have shown that like microbes,LhEVs are endocytosed and can damage the late endocytic compartments. This suggests that their biochemical activities may distort and damage intracellular membranes although how this occurs mechanistically is unclear. A novel family ofLhEV-associated GTPases [15] are possible candidates for such activities as expression of select GTPases in yeast alter vacuolar morphologies [64]. Microbial infection of macrophages can activate apoptosis responses [65–67] and it may be that similar effects ofLhEVs in fly macrophages are directly linked to their apoptosis. Our genetic studies with Rab5 highlight the central role of the endocytic processes in the anti-parasite response. Loss of endocytic trafficking activates immune signaling ([69–71]). From a physiological standpoint, it makes sense why the lymph gland is a dedicated target of wasp infections. Both key aspects of anti-wasp cellular immunity, i.e., phagocytosis of the wasp’s EVs and lamellocyte differentiation, unequivocally reside in the lymph gland. These ideas can be further examined at the molecular level with the available descriptions of theLhandLbEV proteomes [15,19,23]. Virulence factors provide the armament for parasite success in the host/pathogen “arms race”. Insights from this model host-parasite system can influence our understanding of how parasite-derived factors have shaped the immune physiology of fly hosts.

(B, B’) An Antp-positive PSC is disassembled inUAS-Hidanimals afterLhinfection. Lobes are reduced in size. Insets in panels A’ and B’ show Antp-positive PSC cells. (C, D) A PSC-less lymph gland fromCol>Hidnaïve andLh-infected hosts. Lobes are Antp-negative.Col>Hidlobes remain intact afterLh-infection (D, D’). The dashed lines in panels (C) and (D) show the areas where biological samples are present. Arrows point to the general locations where the PSCs should have formed. (A-D) Lobes from naïveAntp-GAL4; hhf4f-GFP(A, C) andAntp>hhRNAi; hhf4f-GFP(B, D) hosts.hhKD increased cortical P1-positive cells (B);Lhinfection leads to hemocyte loss and disassembled PSCs. P1-positive cells are observed post-infection (D). (E, F) Anterior (E) and posterior (F) lobes fromLh-infectedAntp>hhRNAi;hhf4f-GFPhosts show EVs in the few remaining hemocytes. EVs are also evident in the dorsal vessel. (A, A’) ABc+/Bc Pxn>GFPgland showing blackened crystal cells withinPxn>GFP-expressing hemocytes. Arrows points to crystal cell nuclei; arrowheads point toPxn>GFP-positive macrophages. Not all macrophages contain a crystal cell. Hemocytes from anLh-infectedhopTum-lhost in which lamellocytes (L) expressmCD8GFP. Lamellocytes also express high levels of integrin-beta. Double positive lamellocyte fragments in panelAare observed in macrophages (M) indicated by arrows. Signals inA’andA”are merged in panelA. (A, B)Pxn>GFP,Rab5RNAilarvae with melanized tumors. Tumors are absent in the control animal. (C, D) Circulating hemocytes fromRab5KD animals show an overabundance ofPxn>GFP-positive and GFP-negative (lamellocytes) cells. (E) Tumor penetrance (animals with tumors/animals scored) inRab5KD animals varied with different GAL4 drivers. (F) Viability to adulthood was differentially affected. More than 100 animals were scored for each cross in panels (E) and (F). We are grateful to the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, and colleagues for providing fly stocks and antibodies. All relevant data are within the manuscript and itsSupporting Informationfiles. (A, B) SSp40 staining of lymph glands fromLh14-(A-A”) orLhNY-infected (B-B”)Antp>mCD8GFPhosts. Strong punctate EV signals are observed around the GFP-positive PSCs and in hemocytes. Areas in the PSC are enlarged in the insets to show details. (A-C) Antp staining of lymph glands from HandΔ>mCD8GFP(A, A’) and HandΔ>mCD8GFP,Slit-N(B-C’) hosts. The tight clustering of Antp-positive PSC in infected hosts is lost and the PSC is disassembled (C, C’). (D-F) Lymph glands fromAntp>mCD8GFP(D, D’) andAntp>mCD8GFP,Robo2-HAhosts (E-F’). (E, E’) Robo2-HA expression tightens the GFP-positive PSC. (F-F’).Lhattack overrides this effect.LhEVs are associated with theseAntp>mCD8GFP,Robo2-HA lobes(seeS3 Fig). Anterior lobes of lymph glands from uninfectedAntp>mCD8GFP(A, A’) andLh-infectedAntp>mCD8GFP,Robo2-HAanimals (B, B’).
