Kennedy Space Center, Kennedy Space Center, Merritt Island, Florida, USA. Accepted 2021 Apr 15; Collection date 2021 Jul. SPIRRIG and SCAR/WAVE are molecular determinants of actin-mediated root hair development in Arabidopsis. Root hairs are single-cell protrusions that enable roots to optimize nutrient and water acquisition. These structures attain their tubular shapes by confining growth to the cell apex, a process called tip growth. The actin cytoskeleton and endomembrane systems are essential for tip growth; however, little is known about how these cellular components coordinate their activities during this process. Here, we show that SPIRRIG (SPI), a beige and Chediak Higashi domain-containing protein involved in membrane trafficking, and BRK1 and SCAR2, subunits of the WAVE/SCAR (W/SC) actin nucleating promoting complex, display polarized localizations inArabidopsis thalianaroot hairs during distinct developmental stages. SPI accumulates at the root hair apex via post-Golgi compartments and positively regulates tip growth by maintaining tip-focused vesicle secretion and filamentous-actin integrity. BRK1 and SCAR2 on the other hand, mark the root hair initiation domain to specify the position of root hair emergence. Consistent with the localization data, tip growth was reduced inspiand the position of root hair emergence was disrupted inbrk1andscar1234. BRK1 depletion coincided with SPI accumulation as root hairs transitioned from initiation to tip growth. Taken together, our work uncovers a role for SPI in facilitating actin-dependent root hair development in Arabidopsis through pathways that might intersect with W/SC. Root hairs are single-cell tubular projections that emerge from root epidermal cells. Root hairs increase the effective surface area of the root system by extending laterally into soil pores, thus enabling increased access to nutrients and water (Carminati et al., 2017;Ruiz et al., 2020). Root hairs have been studied extensively by plant biologists for decades because they serve as excellent models to unravel mechanisms by which cell size and shape in plants are regulated (Grierson et al., 2014). To attain their cylindrical shapes, root hairs undergo tip growth, a process in which expansion of the cell is confined to its apical domain. Tip growth involves a balance between the directed delivery of post-Golgi compartments carrying protein complexes and cell wall building blocks to the cell apex and localized cell wall loosening and recycling of excess membranes. Besides root hairs, tip growth is exhibited by other cell types such as pollen tubes, fungal hyphae, and rhizoids of mosses, liverworts, and algae (Bascom et al., 2018a). Root epidermal cells called trichoblasts are the cell types that form root hairs. Work inArabidopsis thalianahas shown that trichoblasts are specified to become root hair-forming cells early during root development through the patterned assembly of protein complexes of transcriptional activators and repressors in different cell files (Schiefelbein et al., 2014;Shibata et al., 2018). Upon establishing their identity, trichoblasts undergo two developmental stages that lead to root hair outgrowth. The first stage is the establishment of a root hair initiation domain (RHID) that eventually leads to a conspicuous root hair bulge at the basal (root-tip oriented) end of the trichoblast (Grierson et al., 2014;Nakamura and Grebe, 2018). Several proteins accumulate at the RHID, most prominently, the Rho of Plants (ROP) small GTPases and their guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activators (Denninger et al., 2019). The second stage is tip growth. In addition to small GTPases, the cytoskeleton, the endomembrane trafficking machinery, cytoplasmic calcium, phosphoinositide lipids, hormones (e.g. auxin and ethylene), and reactive oxygen species are other major players in signaling pathways that modulate root hair development (Bascom et al., 2018a;Nakamura and Grebe, 2018). The filamentous-actin (F-actin) and microtubule cytoskeletons orchestrate root hair development. The actin cytoskeleton in particular has been studied widely during tip growth, as it functions as tracks for the trafficking of cellular cargo to the cell apex (Stephan, 2017;Bascom et al., 2018a;Szymanski and Staiger, 2018). Many insights into the role of the actin cytoskeleton in tip growth have been demonstrated through work with Arabidopsis mutants and pharmacological approaches involving the use of chemicals that disrupt F-actin. For example, the actin-disrupting compound latrunculin B (LatB) inhibits tip growth, while also inducing the formation of root hairs and pollen tubes with irregular shapes (Bibikova et al., 1999;Gibbon et al., 1999). In this regard, Arabidopsis mutants with defects in the root hair-expressed vegetativeACTIN2(ACT2) gene are characterized by root hairs that mirror those treated with LatB (Ringli et al., 2002;Yoo et al., 2012). Furthermore,ACT2andACT7mutants display an apical (shoot-ward) shift in the position of the RHID compared to the wild-type (Kiefer et al., 2015). To fulfill its cellular functions, the actin cytoskeleton is organized into higher order networks that correspond to the growth strategy of the cell. This is evident in tip-growing cells, whereby the base and shank of the cell consist mostly of thick, longitudinal F-actin bundles, while the apex contains actin fringes, rings, patches, or a fine meshwork, depending on the plant species or cell type (Stephan, 2017). To sustain tip growth, the integrity and organization of these tip-focused F-actin arrays must be maintained, a task facilitated by a diverse collection of actin-binding proteins and actin nucleators (Li et al., 2015;Paez-Garcia, 2018;Szymanski and Staiger, 2018). The actin-related protein (ARP2/3) complex and its activator, suppressor of cAMP receptor (SCAR)-WASP family verprolin homologous (WAVE) complex (W/SC), is one of the most well-characterized actin nucleators in plants (Deeks and Hussey, 2005;Szymanski, 2005;Yanagisawa et al., 2013). Upon conversion from an inactive open conformation to an active closed conformation, the ARP2/3 complex promotes F-actin nucleation from the sides of existing filaments by forming a surface that mimics stable actin dimers (Blanchoin et al., 2000;Robinson et al., 2001;Rodal et al., 2005). Activation of ARP2/3 for efficient nucleation of F-actin requires the W/SC nucleation promoting factor (NPF) complex. In addition to W/SC, the NPF consists of the proteins SRA1, NAP1, ABI1, and HSPC300/BRICK1 (BRK1) (Basu et al., 2004,2005;El-Assal et al., 2004;Djakovic et al., 2006;Zhang et al., 2005b,2008;Jörgens et al., 2010). Studies of Arabidopsis trichome development have been most instrumental in revealing insights into the function of W/SC-ARP2/3 in plants. Plant counterparts to the mammalian W/SC-ARP2/3 subunits were first uncovered through the cloning of disrupted genes in a set ofDISTORTED(DIS) Arabidopsis trichome mutants (Hülskamp et al., 1994;Le et al., 2003;Mathur et al., 2003;Basu et al., 2004;Deeks et al., 2004; El-Assal Sel et al., 2004;Zhang et al., 2005a). W/SC is the only known NPF for ARP2/3, andBRK1andSCARmutants display nullarp2/3trichome phenotypes (Le et al., 2006;Zhang et al., 2008). In addition to trichome development, the W/SC-ARP2/3 actin filament-nucleating module has been implicated in specifying leaf pavement cell shape, light and auxin-dependent root growth, stomatal gating, gravitropism, responses to salinity stress, and plant immunity (Li et al., 2003;Basu et al., 2005;Zhang et al., 2005a;Dyachok et al., 2011;Zhao et al., 2013; Li et al., 2014;Zou et al., 2016;Isner et al., 2017;Pratap Sahi et al., 2018;Badet et al., 2019). The W/SC and ARP2/3 complexes have been shown to play essential roles in some tip growing cells, such as the protonemal cells of the mossPhyscomitrium(formerlyPhyscomitrella)patens. This was shown when RNA interference of transcripts encoding selected subunits of the moss W/SC and ARP2/3 complexes resulted in substantial protonemal tip growth defects (Harries et al., 2005;Perroud and Quatrano, 2006;Finka et al., 2008). The importance of the W/SC andARP2/3 complexes was further demonstrated byPerroud and Quatrano (2006,2008), who showed that two of its components, BRK1 and ARPC4, accumulated in tips of moss protonemal cells. In contrast, Arabidopsis plants with mutations in components of the W/SC and ARP2/3 complexes displayed minimal or no defects in root hair or pollen tube growth (Li et al., 2003;Mathur et al., 2003), and none of the subunits have been conclusively shown to exhibit clear polar localization in these cell types. Therefore, the extent by which the W/SC and ARP2/3 complexes function in tip growing cells of plants remains to be determined. SPIRRIG(SPI) is one of eight genes that has been considered to be a member of theDISgroup, but compared to otherDISmutants, the trichome phenotypes ofspiare less severe and the mutant does not display early stage cell swelling that is diagnostic of theDISgroup (Schwab et al., 2003).SPIwas shown to encode a 3,571 amino acid long protein with N-terminally located armadillo and concanavalin A-like lectin domains and C-terminally located pleckstrin homology, beige and Chediak Higashi (BEACH), and WD40 repeat domains (Saedler et al., 2009). BEACH domain-containing proteins are highly conserved in eukaryotes and are known to function in membrane dynamics, vesicle transport, apoptosis, and receptor signaling. This family of proteins is of clinical importance as they have been implicated in a variety of human disorders, such as cancer, autoimmunity syndrome, and autism (Cullinane et al., 2013). In addition to mild trichome defects, ArabidopsisSPImutants have short root hairs characterized by fragmented vacuoles, suggesting that SPI, like other eukaryotic BEACH domain-containing proteins, functions in membrane trafficking (Saedler et al., 2009). Additionally,Steffens et al. (2017)showed that SPI physically interacts with proteins involved in endosomal sorting, reinforcing its role in membrane remodeling. SPI was also demonstrated to localize to mRNA processing bodies (P-bodies) in transiently transfected Arabidopsis epidermal cells, thereby suggesting a novel role for SPI in post-transcriptional regulation (Steffens et al., 2015). BecauseSPIhad a substantial but incomplete overlap with distorted mutant phenotypes, it was suggested that SPI might be involved in actin-mediated cell developmental processes (Saedler et al., 2009), and perhaps function in coordination with W/SC and ARP2/3 complexes. However, SPI is not a known W/SC or ARP2/3 subunit; therefore, its relationship to ARP2/3 function is unclear. Moreover, the uncertainty with regard to SPI function is confounded by the fact that its subcellular localization in root hairs, which exhibit the most profound phenotype whenSPIis mutated, remains unknown. Isolation of a newSPIRRIGmutant allele We previously described a forward genetic screen that led to the isolation of three nonallelic recessive Arabidopsis mutants that were hypersensitive to the growth inhibitory effects of LatB. Thehypersensitive to LatB1(hlb1) andhlb3mutants have been described previously (Sparks et al., 2016;Sun et al., 2019).hlb1was disrupted in a gene encoding a trans-Golgi network-localized tetratricopeptide repeat protein involved in actin-mediated membrane recycling (Sparks et al., 2016), whereas the genetic lesion inhlb3was found to encode the class II actin nucleator formin (Sun et al., 2019). Here, we report onhlb2, the third of these recessive mutants. Likehlb1andhlb3, primary root growth was more severely inhibited by LatB inhlb2compared to the wild-type. In the absence of LatB or at low (i.e. 25 nM) LatB concentrations, the primary root length ofhlb2was similar to the wild-type. Differences in root length between wild-type andhlb2became apparent when seedlings were grown on a concentration of 50-nM LatB and higher (Supplemental Figure S1, A–C). SPIRRIG localizes to the tips of rapidly elongating root hairs SPI fluorescent protein fusions were previously demonstrated to associate with P-bodies and endosomes (Steffens et al., 2015,2017). However, these constructs have not been shown to complement the defective root hair and trichome phenotypes ofspi. Due to the large size of SPI, we were unable to generate native promoter-driven fluorescent protein fusions to the full-lengthSPIcomplementary DNA or genomic DNA. To overcome this problem, SPI was tagged with the 3x-Yellow Fluorescent Protein (YFP) forenergytransfer (YPet;Nguyen and Daugherty, 2005) using a method called recombineering. This method involves tagging the gene of interest in the context of transformation-competent bacterial artificial chromosomes to ensure that all regulatory sequences are included in the fluorescent protein fusion (Zhou et al., 2011;Brumos et al., 2020). A functional SPI-YPet fusion localizes to the tips of growing root hairs. A, SPI-YPet rescues the short root hair phenotype ofspi. Bar = 100 µm.

Each dot represents individual measurement from 8 to 10 root hairs per group from 9 to 12 plants SPIRRIG maintains root hair tip-focused F-actin In a study of otherspimutant alleles, the similarities in phenotypes amongspi,w/sc, andarp2/3mutants suggested that SPI could function in actin-dependent cellular processes (Saedler et al., 2009). However, because the trichome defects ofspiwere mild compared to otherw/scandarp2/3mutants, no obvious actin phenotypes were observed inspitrichomes (Schwab et al., 2003). To clarify the relationship between SPI and actin, we focused on investigating actin organization in root hairs, since these structures displayed the most obvious growth defects inSPI-altered plants. To study actin organization, we expressed the live F-actin reporterUBQ10: mGFP-Lifeactinspi(Vidali et al., 2010). This particular F-actin reporter was selected because it prominently labels the tip-focused F-actin meshwork typically observed in root hairs that are rapidly growing (Sparks et al., 2016). In the wild-type, fine F-actin networks were observed in the root hair bulge, which had a weaker signal compared to the thicker actin bundles in other regions of the trichoblast (Figure 3A). As the root hair bulge expanded and the root hair transitioned to rapid tip growth, the tip-focused F-actin meshwork, which consisted of short filaments and dynamic puncta, became more conspicuous (Figure 3, B–E;Supplemental Movie S5;Sparks et al., 2016)). When wild-type root hairs stopped elongating, the tip-focused F-actin meshwork was replaced by thick F-actin cables (Figure 3F). To ensure that the mGFP-Lifectact probe did not interfere with normal root hair elongation or F-actin organization, we compared the growth rates of the wild-type andspiwith and without the reporter. The root hair growth rates of wild-type root hairs without the mGFP-Lifeact probe were not significantly different from that of wild-type root hairs expressing the reporter. Similarly, the growth rate ofspiexpressing mGFP-Lifectact was not significantly different from that ofspiwithout the reporter (Figure 3Q). We generated plants expressing bothSPI-YPetandmRuby-Lifeactto examine the correlation between SPI and F-actin in growing root hairs. In elongating root hairs of dual labeled seedlings, SPI-YPet and the mRuby-labeled F-actin meshwork overlapped at the tips of actively elongating root hairs (Figure 4A;Supplemental Movie S6). In one time-lapse sequence, when the root hair stopped growing at the 80–120 min time points, both SPI-YPet and mRuby-labeled F-actin meshwork dissipated from the root tip (Figure 4A). Quantification of both SPI-YPet and mRuby-Lifeact from at least three root hair time-lapse sequences revealed that the appearances of both markers at the tip were highly correlated to each other (Figure 4, B and C). This supports the notion that root hair tip-localized SPI is strongly associated with the tip-focused F-actin meshwork, and as such is involved in sustaining normal root hair elongation in coordination with actin. SPI-YPet and mRuby-Lifeact co-localizes at the root tip in elongating root hairs. A, Time course of a root hair simultaneously expressing SPI-YPet and mRuby-Lifeact. Note that SPI-positive post-Golgi compartments and F-actin meshworks colocalized at the root hair apex (arrows) and dissipated at around the same time (arrowheads) at 80 min. Images are single median optical sections. Bars = 10 µm. B, Method for obtaining SPI-YPet and mRuby-Lifeact ratios at the root hair tip for data shown in (C). A rectangular ROI at the tip and sub apex was used to measure fluorescence. C, Scatter plot showing correlation analysis of root hair tip mRuby-Lifeact fluorescence and SPI-YPet fluorescence within the same root hair. The mean fluorescence in the rectangle in region 1 divided by the rectangle in region 2 as shown in (C) represents the fluorescence ratio for each reporter. For each ratio value, root hair growth rate was obtained by measuring the displacement of the root hair tip after a 10 min interval. Line shows linear regression fit withR2value = 0.725 andP= 2.127 × 10−8(n= 26 time points from three root hair sequences) BRK1 and SCAR2 are molecular determinants of the root hair initiation domain The identification ofSPIas one of the genes in theDISgroup that also included genes encoding subunits of the W/SC and ARP2/3 complexes (Saedler et al., 2009) raises the possibility that SPI might function in root hair developmental pathways mediated by W/SC-ARP2/3. Furthermore, the observation that SPI-YPET accumulation at the root hair tip (Figure 1) mirrors the enrichment of BRK1-YFP and ARPC4-GFP at the apex ofPhyscomitriumprotonemal cells (Perroud and Quatrano, 2006,2008) raises the possibility that the W/SC and ARP2/3 complexes are localized to the root hair. In an attempt to link SPI with the W/SC and ARP2/3 pathways, we imaged roots ofbrk1complemented withBRK1promoter:BRK1-YFP(hereafter referred to as BRK1-YFP;Figure 5, A–C; Dyachok et al., 2008). Unlike SPI-YPet, we did not observe a BRK1-YFP fluorescence gradient in rapidly elongating root hairs. However, closer examination of trichoblasts revealed prominent BRK1-YFP signal at the plasma membrane of the RHID that mirrored the localization of other known early root hair initiation site markers such as ROP (Figure 5A). Unlike ROP, which has a persistent plasma membrane localization throughout root hair development (Molendijk et al., 2001;Jones et al., 2002), BRK1-YFP signal was transient and dissipated as root hairs transitioned to rapid tip growth (Figure 5B;Supplemental Movie S7). This observation was in contrast to the intensification of SPI-YPet fluorescence as root hairs proceeded with rapid tip growth (seeFigure 1). In agreement with our visual observations, a linear regression analysis showed that BRK1-YFP fluorescence is inversely proportional to the root hair growth rate (Figure 5C). The accumulation of BRK1-YFP and SCAR2-mCherry at the RHID led us to hypothesize thatbrk1andscar1234might have defects in root hair initiation. One parameter that has been studied extensively as an indicator of root hair initiation defects is planar polarity, which is a measure of root hair position along the length of the trichoblast (Nakamura and Grebe, 2018). We found that the root hair positions ofbrk1andscar1234shifted apically (i.e. toward the shoot) compared to the wild-type (Figure 5F). The planar polarity defects ofbrk1were rescued by expressingBRK1-YFPinbrk1, while partial complementation ofscar1234was achieved by expressingSCAR2-mCherryinscar1234(Figure 5F). SPI is required for the depletion of BRK1 as root hairs transition to tip growth Depletion of BRK1 as root hairs transition to tip growth is delayed inspi.A, Dual imaging of BRK1-mRuby3 (arrowheads) and SPI-YPet shows that dissipation of BRK1 coincides with accumulation of SPI (arrow) as root hairs transition to rapid tip growth. Bar = 20 µm. B and C, BRK1-YFP signal persists inspiroot hair bulges (arrows in B) that fail to transition to tip growth and in slow-growingspiroot hairs (arrows in C). Bars = 20 µm. D, Method for quantification of BRK1-YFP signal persistence in the root tip ofspi. Root hairs ofbrk1andspiexpressing BRK1-YFP that were approximately 40 µm in length were selected. Rectangular ROIs (1 and 2) were drawn to obtain fluorescence values. Ratio values were obtained by dividing mean fluorescence in rectangle region 1 over region 2 used to plot data in (E). E, Box plot of BRK1-YFP root hair tip gradient expressed as fluorescence ratio. Box limits indicate 25th and 75th percentiles, horizontal line is the median and whiskers display minimum and maximum values. **P<0.01 indicates statistical significance as determined by Student’sttest. Each dot represents measurement from three to six root hairs per group from eight plants. Only root hairs of similar length were compared. The average root hair length forbrk1was 37.28 µm (standard deviation 18.05 µm) and forspi5was 38.74 µm (standard deviation 18.34 µm). F, Accumulation of SPI-YPet at the root hair tip is not altered inbrk1. Bar = 20 µm Our work uncovers important insights into the mechanism underlying actin-mediated root hair development. A major result from our studies is the revelation that SPI is a root hair tip-localized protein. Although SPI fused to fluorescent proteins was reported to localize to endosomes and P-bodies, such studies have been limited to transient expression assays in biolistically bombarded leaves (Steffens et al., 2015,2017). As such, a mechanistic link between reported SPI subcellular localization patterns and cell growth phenotypes (i.e. short root hairs and distorted trichome shapes) described in the originalspimutant alleles has been unclear. The large size of SPI and the possibility that it is targeted to discrete cellular domains could have hindered transgenic complementation and subsequent in planta localization efforts. Through our work, we demonstrated that a SPI-YPet fusion generated through recombineering complementedspi(Zhou et al., 2011;Brumos et al., 2020). In doing so, we provide compelling evidence that SPI is a root hair tip-enriched BEACH domain-containing protein. Our studies indicate that SPI mediates root hair tip growth by maintaining the tip-focused fine F-actin meshwork, although the precise mechanism by which this is accomplished is unknown. The root hair tip-focused F-actin meshwork is the functional equivalent of domain-specific actin structures found in other tip-growing cells, such as cortical actin fringes in pollen tubes and actin spots in moss protonemata (Bascom et al., 2018a). Although the tip-focused F-actin meshwork was able to form in a population ofspiroot hairs, it often dissipated or was replaced by thick actin cables, a feature of mature wild-type root hairs that are terminating tip growth. Although the presence of tip-focused SPI-YPet was strongly correlated with the maintenance of the tip-focused F-actin meshwork, direct causal links between SPI and F-actin have yet to be established. An alternative explanation is that tip growth-induced reduction due to the absence of SPI could lead to downstream, indirect effects on actin organization. The formation of SPI-YPet agglomerates in response to BFA indicates that SPI is associated with post-Golgi compartments. This result is consistent with observations made with BEACH domain-containing proteins in mammals. For example, Nbea was shown to localize to vesicular endomembranes adjacent to the TGN, and like SPI, the distribution of Nbea-positive post-Golgi compartments was altered by BFA (Wang et al., 2000). Furthermore, theCaenorhabditis elegans(nematode) Nbea homolog SEL-2 was demonstrated to function in endomembrane trafficking in polarized epithelial cells based on the finding thatsel-2mutants mistarget proteins normally found in the apical cell surface to the basolateral surface (de Souza et al., 2007). Here, the protein secretory marker SEC-RFP, which is typically trafficked to the tips of elongating wild-type root hairs (Sparks et al., 2016), was uniformly distributed inspiroot hairs. The absence of tip-directed SEC-RFP gradients inspiroot hairs shows that, as in mammals, plant BEACH domain-containing proteins are required for the proper targeting of molecular cargo to points of polarized cell growth. The weakening of BRK1-mRuby3 fluorescence coinciding with SPI-YPet accumulation, and the persistence of SPI-YPet signal inspiroot hair tips, provides indirect evidence that SPI might play a role in mediating BRK1 stability or localized clustering at the plasma membrane of the RHID. Although it is unknown why BRK1-YFP signal persists inspi, it is tempting to speculate that SPI might modulate BRK1 via protein degradation pathways. This possibility is supported by studies in mammals pointing to a role for BEACH domain-containing proteins in protein degradation via the ubiquitination pathway. In mouse models, for example, the BEACH domain-containing protein WDR81 was shown to be essential for the removal of autophagy-dependent ubiquitinated proteins (Liu et al., 2017). In this regard, it is worth noting that the W/SC-ARP2/3 pathway was demonstrated to function in stress-induced autophagy (Wang et al., 2016) and that proteasome inhibitors stabilized SCAR during dark-induced primary root growth inhibition (Dyachok et al., 2011). It is possible that SPI-mediated proteolytic pathways and BRK1 coordinate their activities to specify the levels of W/SC at the RHID that enable the transition to actin-dependent rapid tip growth. However, such a scenario is complicated by the observation that the formation of tip-directed SPI-YPet does not appear to require BRK1. This suggests that SPI’s appearance at the root hair tip is likely regulated by other factors besides the W/SC complex. Alternatively, the failure of BRK1 to disappear from the RHID inspimutants may be caused by a general failure to transition to normal tip growth. Future studies will require subjecting root hairs to conditions that prematurely terminate tip growth to determine if BRK1 signals persist. In summary, our work provides data that contribute to our understanding of actin-mediated root hair development. A crucial result from our work is the discovery that SPI and the W/SC subunits BRK1 and SCAR2 exhibit polarized localization patterns in root hairs that point to potential functional relationships among these proteins during root hair development. In the future, it will be important to evaluate genetic interactions between SPI and W/SC and ask whether SPI physically interacts with actin or subunits of W/SC to better explain the functional links between SPI and W/SC. Forward-genetic screening and map-based cloning TheA. thaliana hlbmutants from which thespi-5mutant allele was identified were isolated from a population of T-DNA seeds (Arabidopsis Biological Research Center stock CS31100). Plants generated from these seeds were transformed with the activation tagging pSKI015 plasmid (Weigel et al., 2000;Sparks et al., 2016;Sun et al., 2019). Briefly, mutagenized seeds were surface sterilized in 95% (v/v) ethanol and 20% bleach (v/v), followed by three washes in sterile deionized water. A solution of 0.5× Murashige and Skoog (MS) basal salt medium with vitamins (PhytoTech Labs, USA) and 1% (w/v) sucrose was prepared, and the pH of the solution was adjusted to 5.7. After adding 0.5% agar (w/v) (Sigma-Aldrich), the solution was autoclaved and allowed to cool at room temperature. Upon reaching 55°C, a stock solution of 10-mM LatB (CalBiochem-EMD Chemicals) in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added to make a final LatB concentration of 100 nM. Sterilized seeds were suspended in the MS–agar–LatB medium and gently swirled to evenly distribute the seeds. The seed–MS–agar–LatB mixture was poured to a thickness of 2 mm on the bases of 10 cm × 10 cm Petri dishes. After incubating the plates at 4°C for 48 h, they were positioned vertically in a Conviron plant growth chamber set to 24°C with a 14-h light (120 µmol m−2s−1)/10-h dark cycle. Six days after transfer to the Conviron growth chamber, seedlings that exhibited severe growth inhibition were transplanted to LatB-free medium and grown to maturity. For LatB hypersensitivity assays, seeds from selected plants and thehlb2mutant were planted on the surface of a 3 mm layer of polymerized 0.5× MS—1% agar growth medium in gridded square 10 cm × 10 cm Petri plates and grown in the same Conviron used for screening. Four-day-old seedlings with primary roots that were ∼1 cm long were selected. Selected seedlings were transplanted to a new set of square Petri dishes containing MS medium supplemented with 50-nM LatB or MS supplemented with the appropriate volume of LatB solvent (i.e. DMSO). During transplantation, the tip of the root was positioned at the grid line of the Petri dish and maintained in a vertical orientation. Four days after transplanting, images of the roots were captured with a Nikon Insight digital camera mounted on a copy stand. Primary root length was expressed as the distance between the position of the root tip 4 d after transplantation and the grid line where the root tip was positioned during transplantation (Supplemental Figure S1). To identify theHLB2gene, homozygoushlb2(Col-0 ecotype) was out-crossed to theLandsberg erectaecotype to generate seeds for map-based cloning because attempts to identify the responsible mutation for thehlb2phenotype using TAIL-PCR had been unsuccessful. Segregating F2 seedlings were surface sterilized as described above and grown for 3 d. These seedlings were then transferred to MS medium containing 50 nM LatB and root lengths were marked on the plates to track root growth. Transferred seedlings were grown vertically for an additional 4 d in the growth chamber and seedlings that showed root hypersensitivity to 50-nM LatB were selected for mapping. Briefly, DNA was extracted (Edwards et al., 1991) from approximately 2,600 LatB sensitive seedlings and cloned with simple sequence length polymorphism and cleavage of amplified polymorphic site markers to chromosome one between theAT1G02740andAT1G03410loci (Lukowitz et al., 2000), which spanned 248 kb and contained 77 annotated genes. Primers were then designed to several candidate genes based on the sequenced 248-kb region. Nucleotide sequencing revealed that thehlb2mutation had a 10-base pair deletion (Chr1 position 720, 152–720, 161) in exon 14 of theAT1G03060gene. In addition, we obtained a T-DNA insertional mutant (SALK_065311) from the ABRC with a predicted insertion inSPI. After genotyping, SALK_065311 was subjected to similar LatB hypersensitivity and growth assays ashlb2as mentioned above. Allelism was determined by examining the F1 progeny from a cross betweenhlb2×SALK_065311. Following the nomenclature ofSteffens et al. (2015), SALK_065311 andhlb2were namedspi-3andspi-5, respectively. Generation of fluorescent protein-tagged constructs and plant lines The SPI protein was tagged at the C-terminus with the fluorescent protein 3x-YPet via the recombineering method (Zhou et al., 2011).Agrobacterium tumefaciensUIA143 pMP90 harboring a SPI-YPet recombineering construct was used to transform thespi-5mutant by the floral dip method (Clough and Bent, 1998). Transgenic lines were isolated based on resistance to kanamycin and restoration of the wild-type root length. TheSPI-YPettransgene was amplified with primers (5′-ATTCCACAAGCAACCAGTCAC-3′ and 5′-AACAGAGTTGAGAGTGGCTCG-3′) and sequenced to confirm the correct configuration. Final validation ofSPI-YPetexpression was accomplished by screening selected lines under the confocal microscope for YPet fluorescence and complementation of the short root hair phenotype. SCAR2-mCherrylines were also generated by recombineering in which an mCherry tag was fused to an internal region of SCAR2 (Sharan et al., 2009). The mCherry tag was inserted after amino acid 585 in SCAR2 to generate SCAR2-i2mCherry. Recombineering primers were designed as follows: the forward primer contained 50 SCAR2 nucleotides upstream from the insertion site of SCAR2 and 18 nucleotides of the 5′-end of the mCherry cassette, which had a 5× Glycine, 1 Alanine linker. The reverse primer contained 50 nucleotides after the insert site of SCAR2 and 24 nucleotides of the 3′-end of the mCherry cassette. The JAtY75L14 clone was transformed into the recombineering competentEscherichia colistrain SW105 and recombined with the SCAR2-i2mCherry recombineering cassettes. A flippase recombination reaction removed the ampicillin resistance marker. The sequence between the two test primers was verified by DNA sequencing. The clones were transformed into Agrobacterium and then intoscar1234plants (Dyachok et al., 2008). Because bothscar1234plants and the recombineering clones were Basta resistant, plants on MS plates were screened by eye for rescued trichome phenotypes. Rescued plants were genotyped with the recombineering test primers and screened for fluorescence under a confocal microscope. TheBRK1promoter: BRK1-YFPintroduced into thebrk1-1mutant andARPC5-GFPare described inDyachok et al. (2008)andYanagisawa et al. (2015), respectively. For theBRK1-mRuby3construct, the fluorescent protein 3x-mRUBY3 was tagged with a C-terminal linker (10 Alanine, Glycine) using Thermo Fisher Scientific GeneArt to include BamH1 and XbaI sites at its 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. Codon optimization for Arabidopsis was performed on the 3x-mRUBY3 and internal linkers prior to synthesis. The 3X-mRuby3 fragment was inserted as a BamH1/XbaI into the plasmidpBRK:YFPpEZRK(Dyachok et al., 2008).The Agrobacterium floral dip method (Clough and Bent, 1998) was used to transformbrk1-2plants, and transformation was confirmed when this construct fully restored defectivebrk1-2trichomes. Generation of dual fluorescent protein-labeled plant lines Evaluation of root hair growth rate Seeds were surface-sterilized in ethanol and bleach as described above. To evaluate root hair growth rate, seeds were planted on 48 × 64 mm coverslips coated with 0.5× MS, 1% sucrose, and 0.4% (w/v) Gelzan CM (Sigma Aldrich, USA) according toDyachok et al. (2016). The coverslips were placed in 9-cm round Petri dishes and the seeds stratified at 4°C for 48 h. After stratification, the coverslip system with planted seed were kept in a 24°C growth chamber under a 14-h light (120 µmol m−2s−1)/10-h dark cycle for 5–6 d. To quantify root hair growth rate, time-lapse sequences of elongating root hairs at intervals of 10 min over a period of 60 min from a region of the primary root located between 2 and 3 mm from the root tip were captured with a Nikon Eclipse TE300 inverted microscope using a 10× objective. Root hair lengths at various time points were extracted from digital images using ImageJ (v1.51) software (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/). The displacement of the root hair tip after each 10-min interval was obtained and divided by 10 to obtain growth rate as µm/min. Chemical treatments of root hairs For BFA treatment, a stock solution of 10 mM was made by dissolving BFA powder (Sigma-Aldrich) in DMSO. Subsequently, the working solution of 50 µM was diluted in 0.5× MS, 1% sucrose solution, and loaded into a 1-mL syringe. The BFA solution was injected directly next to the roots of 4- to 5-d-old Arabidopsis seedlings grown on coverslips and incubated at room temperature for 10 min prior to microscopy. FM 1-43 dye (ThermoFisher Scientific) was dissolved in DMSO to make a 10-mM stock solution. The dye was diluted to 4 µM in 0.5× MS, 1% sucrose solution. The dye was loaded into a 1-mL syringe, and the solution was injected next to the roots as described above. Live cell imaging of root hairs using confocal microscopy was performed on 4- or 5-d-old seedlings grown on the 48 mm × 64 mm coverslip system described above. Coverslips with seedlings were placed horizontally on the stage of an inverted Leica SP8-X point scanning confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL, USA) or an UltraView ERS spinning-disc confocal microscope (Perkin Elmer Life and Analytical Sciences, Waltham, MA, USA) equipped with 40 × water (numerical aperture = 1.10) or 100 × oil (numerical aperture = 1.40) immersion objectives. SPI-YPet and YFP-BRK1 were imaged by illuminating roots growing along the coverslip surface with the 514 nm line of the SP8-XArgon laser and emission detected at 527 nm. Images of root hairs expressing SCAR2-mCherry, BRK1-mRuby3, Lifeact-mRuby, and SEC7-RFP were acquired by illumination with the tunable SP8-X white light laser (560-580 nm) and detecting emission at 610 nm. Excitation and emission parameters for GFP (GFP-ARPC5 and mGFP-Lifeact) were 488 nm and 510 nm, respectively. Time-lapse movies or single time point images were collected using Volocity acquisition version 6.3.5 (Improvision) or SPX-8 LAS software, for the UltraView and Leica SP8-X, respectively. Root hair growth rate data for scatter plots inFigures 1and5were derived from the same root hair images in which fluorescence images were acquired under a Leica SP8-X. For the former, an image of a root hair was taken at time 0 and every 5 min thereafter. Scatter plots to determine the relationship between growth rate and tip-focused fluorescence were generated in R (R Core Team, 2019) using the ggplot function in the ggplot2 package (Wickham, 2016). Linear regression analysis between two variables was performed using the lme4 package in R software (Bates et al., 2015;R Core Team, 2019). Root hair growth rate forFigure 3Qwas obtained directly on a Nikon TE300 from root hairs growing in 0.5× MS, 1% sucrose, and 0.4% Gelzan in 5-cm diameter round Petri dishes. Time-lapse images were taken every 10 min over a period of 60 min. The growth rate refers to the displacement of the root hair tip in micrometer divided by time elapsed (min).
