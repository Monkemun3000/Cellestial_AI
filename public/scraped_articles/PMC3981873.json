When the ER protein folding machinery is competent, stress sensors are restrained in the ER by ER-resident chaperones (Bertolottiet al.2000,Kimataet al.2003). Accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER activates ER stress sensors either by causing them to dissociate from protein chaperones or to associate with unfolded proteins (Bertolotti,et al. 2000,Credleet al.2005,Gardner and Walter 2011,Kimataet al. 2003). Activated ER stress sensors transmit signals to the nucleus for transcriptional regulation of UPR target genes (Kozutsumiet al. 1988,Schroder and Kaufman 2005). If ER stress is not resolved, the UPR triggers the activation of cell death (Linet al.2007). IRE1, the only identified ER stress sensor in yeast, is conserved in multicellular eukaryotes (Coxet al.1993,Moriet al.1993). Two IRE1 homologues, AtIRE1A and AtIRE1B, have been proven to be functional ER stress sensors inArabidopsis(Chen and Brandizzi 2012,Nagashimaet al.2011). The activation of IRE1 relies on auto-phosphorylation, conformational modification, and oligomerization. Activated IRE1 splices an intron from the mRNA of a UPR-specific bZIP transcription factor (Cox and Walter 1996). The spliced transcription factor enters the nucleus to control UPR target genes (Cox and Walter 1996). The UPR is critical for numerous fundamental cellular processes (Wu and Kaufman 2006). IRE1 alpha knockout mice exhibit embryonic lethality (Iwawakiet al.2009). Dysregulation of the UPR contributes to the pathology of several significant diseases, including diabetes, neurodegeneration, and cancer (Marciniak and Ron 2006). InArabidopsis, mutations of IRE1 lead to a short primary root phenotype (Chen and Brandizzi 2012). Despite the high significance of the UPR in growth and development in multicellular eukaryotes, the regulatory connections between the UPR and other cellular responses remain unclear. Because the hormone auxin has profound roles in most plant developmental processes, nucleus-based auxin signaling and plasma membrane (PM)-based intercellular auxin transport have been intensively studied. Three major classes of auxin signaling regulators exist in the nucleus: TIR1/AFB auxin co-receptors (Dharmasiriet al.2005,Grayet al.1999,Kepinski and Leyser 2005), AUX/IAA transcriptional repressors (Grayet al.2001), and ARF transcription factors (Ulmasovet al.1997). To initiate the auxin response in the nucleus, TIR1/AFBs and auxin coordinately promote degradation of AUX/IAA transcriptional repressors. Consequently, ARFs are released from repression and activate the transcription of auxin responsive genes (Dharmasiriet al. 2005,Gray, del Pozoet al. 1999,Kepinski and Leyser 2005). Directional (polar) transport between cells is another crucial regulatory aspect of the auxin response. The auxin efflux carriers of the PIN family are the principal components of the polar auxin transport machinery (Petraseket al.2006,Wisniewskaet al.2006). Based on protein topology and subcellular localization, PINs can be classified into PM- or ER-localized types (Dal Boscoet al.2012,Dinget al.2012,Mravecet al.2009). While PM-based intercellular auxin transport has been considered the most critical point of regulation in the auxin response, it has recently been revealed that ER-based auxin regulation is also important. A putative auxin receptor, ABP1, and several auxin transporters (PIN5, PIN6, PIN8, and PILSs) have been shown to localize to the ER. The requirement of the ER-localized regulators in the auxin response underscores the existence of ER-based auxin biology (Barbezet al.2012,Dal Boscoet al. 2012,Mravecet al. 2009). Despite accumulating evidence that the ER is crucial for auxin regulation (Friml and Jones 2010), the physiological impact of ER-based auxin signaling is largely unknown. As the UPR is critical for growth and development, we sought to identify the regulatory connection between the UPR and other cellular regulatory processes. Given the central roles of auxin in numerous aspects of plant physiology, we hypothesized that the UPR regulates auxin signaling for coordinating secretory activities and physiological responses. Through biochemical, molecular biology, and genetic analyses, we demonstrate a connection between the UPR and auxin biology. Specifically, we show that ER stress negatively influences auxin signaling and that the ER-based auxin homoeostasis is important for UPR activation, supporting that the plant UPR alters auxin signaling to cope with ER stress. On the contrary, by establishing that IRE1 is required for the auxin responses, our work reveals that IRE1 has a specific role in hormonal signaling. The regulatory connections between the UPR and auxin biology revealed here hint that plants have evolved an organism-specific strategy to maintain balance between stress adaption and growth regulation.

IRE1, ER- and PM-localized PINs are involved in the maintenance of auxin homeostasis without chemical induction of ER stress. (b) ER stress triggers down-regulation of auxin receptors TIR1/AFBs, ER- and PM-localized PINs. IRE1 and ER-localized PINs are required for the optimal induction of UPR target genes. PIN5 has been proposed to play a unique role in the auxin response since its transcriptional regulation and regulatory mechanisms appear to be different from PM-localized PINs. It was reported that the transcription of PIN5 is decreased under exogenous application of auxin although PIN5 is required for the auxin response (Mravecet al.2009). Likewise, our study also showed that ER stress induces a decrease in the transcription of PIN5 while PIN5 is required for the optimal induction of UPR activation. As the PIN5 protein levels have not been monitored under auxin or ER stress treatment, one possibility is that the down-regulation of PIN5 transcript represents a feedback regulatory mechanism. Namely, the cellular availability or the activity of PIN5 may be increased in response to ER stress (e.g. by protein stabilization events or post-translational modifications). This in turn may cause reduction of PIN5 transcriptional levels to safeguard cellular auxin homeostasis. Another possibility is that ER stress represses general auxin responses including inter- and intra-cellular auxin transport to optimize cellular responses to cope with stress. Thus, both PM- and ER-localized transporter are down-regulated under ER stress; however, a basal level of ER-localized transporters may be still required for optimal induction of UPR target gene as they might be involved in stress signal transmission through transport the auxin between subcellular compartments. Thus, mutants of ER-localized auxin regulators would display a compromised UPR activation. Further experimental evidences are needed to verify the possibilities. Nonetheless, our data support that regulation of PIN5 transcripts is a mechanism to maintain PIN5-related cellular homeostasis. Also,pin5-5was shown to have a higher free auxin levels (Mravecet al.2009) but we found thatpin5-5displayed lower free auxin level. This is possibly because unlike Mravecet al, which used intact seedlings, we used only root tissues in the free auxin level assay. Future comprehensive quantification analyses of free auxin levels in various tissues will likely reveal whether PIN5 regulates auxin distribution among tissues. The molecular mechanisms underlying transcriptional down-regulation of auxin receptors and transporters on ER stress are still unknown. Whether UPR regulators can directly control transcription of auxin receptors and transporters or ER stress-dependent cellular responses mediate auxin homeostasis in a manner independent of classical UPR regulation awaits further validation. In contrast to animals, plants, as sessile organisms, have an extraordinary plasticity in post-embryonic development, responding to both internal and external cues. Nonetheless, our understanding of how plants integrate developmental and environmental signals to balance growth and adaptive regulation is limited. The inter-regulation between the UPR and auxin response demonstrated in this study opens a new area of investigation in plant physiology. Given the essential roles of the UPR in multiple stresses adaptation, the integrated action of the UPR and auxin response highlights a plant-specific strategy that evolved to maintain the crucial balance between stress response and growth regulation for ultimate fitness. Plant material and growth conditions Arabidopsis thalianaecotype Columbia (Col-0) plants were used. Surface-sterilized seeds were plated directly onto petri dishes containing half-strength Linsmaier and Skoog (LS) medium, 1.5% w/v sucrose, and 0.4% Phytagel (Sigma). For normal growth conditions, plants were grown at 21°C under a 16-h light/8-h dark cycle. Seeds were germinated and grown on half-strength LS medium for 10 days, and then transferred to half-strength LS medium containing 5 μg/ml Tm (Sigma) for the indicated periods of time. RNA extraction and quantitative RT-PCR analysis Root length and hypocotyl elongation measurements were averaged from 30 plants for each genotype. Data were analyzed by Student’s two-tailedt-test, assuming equal variance; differences with aP-value < 0.05 were considered significant. Immunoblotting and confocal microscopy analyses Fifty milligrams of fresh root tissues was ground in plastic tubes with plastic pestles using liquid nitrogen and 500 ml of SDS-containing extraction buffer (60 mM Tris-HCL (pH 8.8), 2% SDS, 2.5% glycerol, 0.13 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), and 1X Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Complete (Roche)). The tissue lysates were vortexed for 30 s, heated at 70°C for 10 minutes, and then centrifuged at 13,000 g twice for 5 minutes at room temperature. The supernatants were transferred to new tubes. For SDS-PAGE analysis, 5 ml of the extract in 1x NuPAGE LDS Sample Buffer (Invitrogen) was separated on 4–12% NuPage gel (Invitrogen) and transferred to PVDF (polyvinyl difluoride) membrane. The membrane was incubated with 3% BSA in 1x TBST (50 mM Tris-base, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 8.0) overnight at 4°C, and was probed with antibody (α-GFP, 1:20,000; Abcam) diluted in the blocking buffer (1:20,000) at room temperature for 1 h. The probed membrane was washed three times with 1x TBST for 5 min and then incubated with secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgG for α-GFP, 1:20,000; Abcam) at room temperature for 1 h. The membrane was further washed four times with 1x TBST for 10 min before the signals were visualized with SuperSignal® West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (Pierce Biotechnology). To visualize YFP fluorescence, an inverted laser scanning confocal microscope Zeiss LSM510 was used to detect the DII expression. Approximately 20 roots were cut from ten-day-old seedlings and trasferred into an Eppendorf tube containing 1 ml of methanol. Internal standard of [2H5] IAA was added to the sample at amount of 100 fmol per root. Figure S1. Tunicamycin induces activation of UPR target gene.
