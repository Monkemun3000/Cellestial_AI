Exposure to the unique set of spaceflight environmental conditions, including microgravity, cosmic radiation, isolation, and confinement, has been shown to induce significant physiological changes in all studied species to date [1,2,3]. These physiological responses, such as skeletal muscle atrophy, can negatively impact the health of astronauts and may also compromise mission success if left unabated [4]. The precise molecular mechanisms underlying physiological deconditioning in spaceflight have yet to be fully described, and advancement of this mechanistic understanding is essential for the development of molecularly rationalized countermeasures [5]. Such countermeasures can help maintain astronaut health during future spaceflight missions, including long duration voyages to Mars in which current countermeasures are likely to prove insufficient [6]. Studies leveraging data from omics disciplines, including transcriptomics, allow for a detailed study of the complex interactions between the molecular landscape of biological systems and spaceflight environmental conditions. Despite the scientific potential of omics datasets captured in spaceflight, only a relatively small number have been collected, mainly due to the resource-intensive nature of spaceflight experiments. NASA GeneLab was established to maximize the use of the limited number of spaceflight omics datasets. The datasets made publicly available via the GeneLab repository represent a variety of omics data types and a range of model organisms, including microbes, plants, cell cultures, vertebrates, and invertebrates [7,8]. Additionally, datasets from ground-based studies that are relevant to the spaceflight environment can be accessed via public repositories, including GeneLab and NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) [9]. Although physiological and other functional data is required to establish clear relationships between omics changes and physiological changes, independent analysis of omics datasets is still useful for hypothesis generation, which can be used to inform future research directions. There remain numerous opportunities to use publicly available omics datasets to elucidate knowledge gaps in the field of space biology. One such knowledge gap that currently requires further investigation is that of shared and discrete transcriptomic responses across biological tissue types, such as different muscles. Addressing this knowledge gap can prove useful for designing countermeasures that can target multiple tissues, or for providing evidence for the need to employ multiple countermeasures to provide comprehensive protection to a variety of tissues. Aside from its role in locomotion and posture, skeletal muscle plays other vital roles in whole-body health. Skeletal muscle physically shields organs and helps maintain temperature homeostasis. Additionally, as the body’s largest store of amino acids, skeletal muscle engages in crosstalk with other organs, to synthesize organ-specific proteins [10]. When the body is threatened by starvation or disease, skeletal muscle is broken down to provide other organs with energy [11]. To date, antigravity muscles in the limbs have been the main focus for studying the skeletal muscle response to spaceflight. These muscles are key to maintaining posture under 1G conditions, and are thus highly susceptible to atrophy when unloaded [12]. Certain antigravity muscles in the lower limb, such as the soleus and gastrocnemius, are also important for circulation, as upon contraction they pump venous blood back to the heart, preventing pooling and stagnation [13]. Alongside reduced muscle mass, strength, and endurance, it has been found that the mechanical unloading associated with microgravity induces a shift from type I slow twitch fibers to type II fast twitch fibers [14,15]. Previous spaceflight and ground studies in rodents and humans have also observed that antigravity muscles consisting of mainly type I (slow-twitch) fibers, which are designed for slow and sustained contraction, such as the soleus tend to be more susceptible to atrophy compared to antigravity muscles with more type II (fast-twitch) fibers [16]. Recently, Choi and colleagues reported findings from NASA’s Rodent Research-1 (RR-1) mission, in which mice were flown onboard the International Space Station (ISS) and exposed to microgravity for 37 days. They found that the weight of the soleus in space flown mice was reduced by ~19% compared to ground control mice [17]. In addition, they reported that the gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior (TA), extensor digitorum longus (EDL), and quadriceps did not show significant atrophy compared to ground control mice [17]. While significant atrophy of the soleus is consistent with findings from similar studies, the finding of non-significant atrophy in the gastrocnemius is contrary to previous space flown mouse studies [18,19,20]. Similarly, previous transcriptomic analyses of RR-1 data have reported that the soleus showed the greatest number of significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) [21,22] compared to other muscle tissues. However, all muscle tissues did show significant gene expression changes, and hierarchical clustering of these changes indicated that the muscle tissues can be divided into two distinct groups. Group 1 consisted of plantar flexor muscles, soleus, and gastrocnemius, while group 2 consisted of dorsiflexors EDL and TA and knee extensors, quadriceps. In addition, microgravity responsive changes in immune-related pathway regulation appeared to be more prevalent in group 1 muscles compared to group 2 [21]. A different analysis of RR-1 data highlighted that changes in the expression of clock genes were fairly uniform across the muscle tissues, and yet distinct compared to other tissues such as the liver [22]. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that while certain muscles may not undergo significant atrophy in spaceflight, they still undergo molecular changes that may require intervention. Additionally, these findings support the hypothesis that in certain cases, the response to spaceflight is not identical between muscle tissues, due to their distinct morphologies and locomotive functions [16]. Further investigation is required to establish precise differences and similarities between the molecular responses of different muscle tissues. Hence in this study, we compared transcriptomic data from the fast-twitch enriched EDL, and the representative slow-twitch muscle soleus [23], collected during the RR-1 mission. We made use of two analysis approaches, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and overrepresentation analysis (ORA) to determine the impact of the analysis approach on outcomes and to better anticipate the array of biological responses to spaceflight. Subsequently, to better understand the analogous nature of ground-based studies, transcriptomic data from the RR-1 quadriceps was compared to the vastus lateralis from a human bed rest study [24], and transcriptomic data from the gastrocnemius from a different space flown mouse study was compared to matching HU samples from that same study [25]. In addition to rodents, invertebrates, includingC. elegansandD. melanogaster, have been established as important model organisms for understanding biological responses to the space environment [26]. While it is possible to isolate muscles in ground laboratories via dissection when the sample size of fresh animals is sufficient [27], whole organism or composite structures such as the head are typically extracted for analysis in spaceflight experiments due to logistical challenges of dissecting samples in orbit. However, insights related to muscle can still be uncovered. For example, reproducible downregulation of muscle-related genes has been observed across the “InternationalC. elegansExperiment FIRST” (ICE-FIRST) and “C. elegansRNA Interference in Space Experiment” (CERISE) microarray experiments [28,29]. Leandro and colleagues performed a comparative analysis of space flownC. elegansfrom the ICE-FIRST experiment and space flownD. melanogasterfrom the GENE experiment [3,30]. Three analysis approaches were tested on the small subset of orthologous genes between the two organisms. Only six genes were found to have a common transcriptomic response in both experiments, with these genes all downregulated and associated with metabolic and neuromuscular signaling [3,31]. 2.1.

Comparison between Ground-Based Unloading Models and Muscles from Space Flown Mice 2.5.1. Comparison between Gastrocnemius from Hindlimb Unloaded and Space Flown Mice A comparison of DEGs in HU and spaceflight gastrocnemius revealed five shared genes with similar patterns of regulation. DEGs upregulated in both datasets suggest that HU and spaceflight both lead to altered circadian rhythm (Nfil3), regulation of proliferation (Btg2) and changes to endothelial adhesion (Cyr61), and scaffolding of acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction (Musk), which may potentially alter muscle function. Additionally,Bdh1, a gene involved in metabolism of ketone bodies, is downregulated in both datasets. This is consistent with a previous study showing an increase in ketone bodies such as 3-hydroxybutyrate in liver of mice flown on STS-135 [54]. 2.5.2. Comparison of Muscles from Bed Rest Study and Space Flown Mice DEGs shared between human bedrest VL and space flown mouse quadriceps and direction of expression. Values shown are Log2 FC. 3.1. Mechanisms of Muscle Atrophy Resistance 3.2. Glucocorticoids and the Circadian Rhythm The enrichment of glucocorticoid (GC) signaling suggests that spaceflight led to upregulation of the stress response. This is consistent with the reported rise in plasma and urine cortisol levels observed in certain but not all of spaceflight studies [113,114]. GCs are steroidal signaling molecules with many roles including the regulation of energy homeostasis. They can cause the breakdown of amino acids and a decrease in insulin sensitivity, which were previously observed in the soleus [115]. GCs can also induce expression of clock genes via GC response elements and may therefore have a role in perturbing the circadian rhythm and sleep cycles during spaceflight [22,116,117,118]. The disturbance of the circadian rhythm in both muscles (EDL and soleus) may also negatively impact muscle mass. For example, knockout of a key circadian gene,Bmalin mice led to premature aging including sarcopenia [119]. Perturbations in GC and the circadian signaling have been implicated in disorders such as metabolic syndrome, [120,121,122], sleep disturbances [123,124], immune dysregulation [100,125,126] and cataracts [127]. Hence, these signaling pathways may potentially represent therapeutic targets for the detrimental effects of spaceflight. 3.3. Spaceflight Alters Mechanosensing and Neuronal Signaling in Mouse Muscle 3.4.C. elegansShows Similarity to Mouse Fast Twitch Muscle Responses to Spaceflight 3.5. Discrete Life Stages of D. melanogaster May Have Distinct Utility for Studying Muscle Types Establishing shared responses to spaceflight betweenD. melanogasterand mammalian muscles also may be of value in anticipating mammalian responses to spaceflight.D. melanogasterare desirable as flight payloads due to their relatively small experimental footprint and their ease of maintenance. A comparison between different life stages ofD. melanogasterand mammalian fast and slow twitch muscles revealed that discrete fly life stages may have differing utility for modeling certain features of the response to spaceflight in these mammalian muscle types. For example, an increase in protein metabolism as well as the downregulation of the UPR, two key features of the soleus response, were observed inD. melanogasterlarvae. Conversely, protein metabolism was downregulated in adultD. melanogasterand not observed in the fast twitch EDL. This may suggest stage-dependent differences in metabolism. Moreover, other features of mature adultD. melanogasterare more akin to the fast twitch muscle, including an increase in amino acid production, calcium signaling and limb morphogenesis suggesting an environment with more growth signals. With regards to metabolism, the increase in expression of genes involved in fatty acid transport in adultD. melanogasteris akin to that of the EDL. However, adultD. melanogasteralso shows a shared degradation of myosin protein with slow twitch muscle EDL. Furthermore, we also found a similar stress response between space flown adultD. melanogasterand mouse fast twitch muscle as indicated by differential regulation of circadian rhythm and antioxidant response genes. Spaceflight and analog studies usingD. melanogastermay allow for greater mechanistic insight on muscle gene regulation under spaceflight conditions. To date, on-orbit sampling of invertebrate models has mostly involved whole animals due to the logistical challenges of performing microdissections of tissues. Transcriptomic signatures can vary across muscle types and such differences may not be captured when analyzing the overall transcriptome from the whole organism. For example, each muscle type inD. melanogasterhas a discrete pattern of isoform expression of Troponin, which regulates thin filament contraction [30,135]. We found that these isoforms are also differentially expressed in both spaceflight and analog experiments, consistent with a previous report [30]. Advances in sample preservation and in situ dissections on orbit will greatly improve our ability to gain mechanistic knowledge from smaller model organisms. 3.6. Differential Regulation of ECM in Spaceflight across Organismal Models 3.7. Transcriptomic Signatures of Spaceflight Models and Analogs Exhibit Similarities and Key Differences We also compared muscles from a rodent spaceflight and human bedrest study, two of the relatively resource intensive approaches to modeling human responses to spaceflight. Both have key advantages relative to ground-based rodent models. The former is expected to reflect mammalian responses to actual spaceflight and the later, actual human physiological responses to unloading. We found that representative mixed fiber type muscles in HU mice and humans on bedrest (quadriceps and VL, respectively) share similarities in differential expression ofTbc1d12, a gene involved in glucose uptake. In addition,Fbxo40, a gene that is also upregulated in a denervation model for muscle atrophy [90] is similarly responsive to both spaceflight in rodents and bedrest. Further, FBXO40 functions as a muscle-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase that is regulated by activated STAT3, thereby increasing insulin resistance in mice under 1G conditions [139]. Upregulation of bothTbc1d12andFbxo40in bedrest and rodent spaceflight models is consistent with reported perturbations in glucose metabolism observed in humans in space [140]. These findings provide a rationale for testing whether targetingFbxo40and its signaling partners will be useful in mitigating muscle atrophy and altered glucose metabolism in both spaceflight and Earth-based scenarios. 4.1. Datasets Used in This Study Differential expression data of RNA-seq datasets (GLDS-99, 103 and 104) were downloaded from NASA GeneLab. The NASA GeneLab online database describes the standard analysis pipeline used to generate this processed data. Briefly, the percentage of rRNA in raw fastq files was assessed using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.0.0) and then filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.2). The quality of both raw and trimmed reads was evaluated with FastQC [143] (version 0.118), while MultiQC [144] (version 1.7) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Indexes for Mus musculus genome were generated with genome version mm10-GRCm38 (Mus_musculus.GRCm38.dna.toplevel.fa), and Mus_musculus.GRCm38.96.gtf using STAR [145] (version 2.7.1a). Processed reads were aligned to theMus musculusreference with STAR (version 2.7.1a) and aligned reads were then quantified using RSEM [146] (version 1.3.1). Quantification data was imported to R [147] (version 3.6.0) with tximport [148] (version 1.14.0) and normalized with DESeq2 [149] (version 1.26.0). Differential expression analysis was conducted in R (version 3.6.0) using DESeq2 (version 1.26.0). All groups were compared using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p value. Gene annotations were assigned using the following Bioconductor and annotation packages: STRINGdb [150], PANTHER.db [151], and org.Mm.eg.db [152]. Differential expression analysis using DESeq2 [153] was performed on expression data from space flown subjects against ground controls to assess gene level changes in these muscles and use in downstream pathway analysis. 4.3.
