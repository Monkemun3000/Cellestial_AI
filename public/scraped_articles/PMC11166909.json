  "content": "Spatial multi-omics of human skin reveals KRAS and inflammatory responses to spaceflight Received 2022 Nov 26; Accepted 2024 Apr 26; Collection date 2024. Spaceflight can change metabolic, immunological, and biological homeostasis and cause skin rashes and irritation, yet the molecular basis remains unclear. To investigate the impact of short-duration spaceflight on the skin, we conducted skin biopsies on the Inspiration4 crew members before (L-44) and after (R + 1) flight. Leveraging multi-omics assays including GeoMx™ Digital Spatial Profiler, single-cell RNA/ATAC-seq, and metagenomics/metatranscriptomics, we assessed spatial gene expressions and associated microbial and immune changes across 95 skin regions in four compartments: outer epidermis, inner epidermis, outer dermis, and vasculature. Post-flight samples showed significant up-regulation of genes related to inflammation and KRAS signaling across all skin regions. These spaceflight-associated changes mapped to specific cellular responses, including altered interferon responses, DNA damage, epithelial barrier disruptions, T-cell migration, and hindered regeneration were located primarily in outer tissue compartments. We also linked epithelial disruption to microbial shifts in skin swab and immune cell activity to PBMC single-cell data from the same crew and timepoints. Our findings present the inaugural collection and examination of astronaut skin, offering insights for future space missions and response countermeasures. Subject terms:Computational models, Image processing, Outcomes research, Risk factors, Systems analysis Here the authors profile skin microenvironment changes in response to spaceflight by performing a multi omics analysis using skin punch biopsies from the crew members of SpaceX Inspiration4 mission comparing before, post launch and one day after return 91 of the 3-day mission. During both short- and long-duration spaceflight, the human body is exposed to various factors that are unique to the space environment, including weightlessness (e.g., microgravity), increased radiation, isolation, and confinement1,2. Due to the unique remote and spaceflight environment, lifestyle and hygienic practices are different from an Earth setting and often simplified due to the minimal resources and space available in a spacecraft (e.g., lack of showers, restrooms, limited clothing available)3. Moreover, significant physiological adaptations and overall shifts in biological homeostasis occur from spaceflight exposure, including musculoskeletal deconditioning, cardiovascular fluid shifts, vision loss (e.g., spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome), metabolic shifts, and mitochondrial and immune dysfunction4,5. Several studies have identified the effects of spaceflight on the musculoskeletal and cardiovascular systems, including fluid redistribution, orthostatic intolerance, changes in heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac output, arterial stiffening, bone loss, atrophy of the striated and cardiac muscle groups, and increased risk of bone fracture1,6–12. The body’s largest organ, the skin, is another key physiological system sensitive to environmental changes. Human skin serves multiple functions, including physical and immunological protection, supporting microbiota (containing bacteria, archaea, fungi, and viruses) homeostasis, thermoregulation, fluid retention, and metabolism13–15. Also, since the skin is the outermost layer of the body and exposed to the direct, external environment, it is usually the first substrate affected by environmental changes an individual experiences, including environmental adaptations resulting from spaceflight. The skin serves as a unique organ for investigating the impacts of spaceflight on the human body as it encompasses a range of physiological elements, from surface microbiota and connective tissue to vasculatures, follicles, and the nervous and immune systems, alongside various skin cell types. It offers a comprehensive platform to understand the multifaceted effects of spaceflight. Unfortunately, few studies exist on the spaceflight environment’s impact on the skin, and observations to-date show that spaceflight may cause epidermal hypersensitivity and irritation, rarefaction of the cutaneous fiber network, and impaired epidermal proliferation and repair16–20. Nonetheless, the skin remains an understudied organ in the field of space biology; to date, fewer than ten astronaut case evaluations have been conducted3. Furthermore, only a few existing studies have examined transcript-level changes, and none of these studies has contextualized spatial or whole transcriptome gene expression or investigated the multiple omics components of skin adapting from spaceflight exposure3,21,22. Our study investigates skin samples collected from the SpaceX Inspiration4 mission and, for the first time, explores the spatial-transcriptomic characterization of short-duration spaceflight’s impact on skin tissue. We comprehensively profiled skin microenvironment changes in response to spaceflight by performing a multi omics analysis using 4 mm skin punch biopsies from the crew members (n= 4) 44 days before launch (L-44) and 1 day after return (R + 1) of the 3-day mission. Tissue location specific gene expression levels were quantified using Nanostring GeoMx™ Digital Spatial Profiler (DSP) system across four regions of interest (ROI) targets, Outer Epidermis (OE) and Inner Epidermis (IE), Outer Dermis (OD), and Vasculature (VA) compartments. From immunofluorescence images, we identified epidermis, dermis, and vascular area and subdivided epidermis ROIs into outer and inner layers, which corresponded to granular and spinous layer (OE) and basal layer (IE). In total, we analyzed 95 astronaut skin ROIs using the human whole-transcriptome atlas (WTA, 18,676 genes). We also correlate these transcript level findings with matched metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data from skin swabs obtained prior to biopsy, as well as single-cell sequencing data (10X multiome single-cell ATAC and gene expression (GEX) characterizations) from isolated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).

Source data are provided as a Source Data file. The Inspiration4 mission was a short-term (3-day flight) spaceflight, with minimal exposure to radiation (about 2.7 mGy-Eq based on NASA Q quality factors and 50% FAX ModelEffective dose). Most of these changes are expected to be temporary, based on prior missions’ data, and due to fluid redistribution and stress from the spaceflight itself. At the molecular level, we observed consistent changes in immune signals and extracellular matrix and junction proteins in the postflight samples relative to preflight. Most evidently, we see a strong increase in gene expression of the KRAS pathway, which has previously been discussed in the context of space radiation51. In the context of skin, KRAS is known to alter epidermis homeostasis and induces redundant skin, papillomas, defective skin cell proliferation and differentiation and associated with many skin diseases such as melorheostosis, lymphangiomatosis, and vascular stenosis52–54. Activated KRAS, as a part of RAS/MAPK signaling pathway, is responsible for many angiogenic pathways, cytokine/chemokine productions, biochemical pathways (e.g.,PI3K,RAF, etc.), and cellular proliferation/renewals55. When activated, the KRAS oncogene has the greatest mutation rate of all cancers, and is linked to several difficult to treat, highly lethal cancers, such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, non-small-cell lung cancer, and colorectal cancer56. Related to this observation, other non-inflammatory pathways such as WNT-βcatenin, TGFβ, Notch, ROS, glycolysis, apoptosis, oxidative phosphorylation, G2M checkpoints, also show significant changes. These pathways may provide more context as to why KRAS is changing, as well as the phenotypic adaptations and distribution changes seen with the cell populations. For example, from a metabolic perspective, an increase in glycolysis and a decrease in oxidative phosphorylation is tied with apoptotic events, decreased oxygen supply/hypoxia (e.g., change in cardiovascular function, increased inflammation, increased wound healing, etc.), as a compensatory response to the environmental insult. TGFβ is involved with ECM remodeling, inflammatory pathways, and these various cell types affect these biological events. Notch and WNT-βcatenin are involved with cytoskeletal/cell-cell adhesion processes. Furthermore, looking at the host of inflammatory pathways changing (interferon, TNFα, complement, interleukin), primarily pro-inflammatory given the timeframe of this mission as well as environmental insults (e.g., radiation exposure, weightlessness) that also exacerbate the biochemical pathways that are being shifted after spaceflight (e.g., metabolic, cell phenotypic, increased apoptosis, etc.). The spatial analysis enabled a unique study of gene expression changes, at higher resolution across the layers of skin, plus also within distinct tissue compartments. While all regions show varying but consistent enrichment in inflammation-related pathways, we are able to locate damage and repair related pathways (i.e., DNA repair, apoptosis, and UV response, reactive oxygen species) in epidermal (mostly outer layers) regions, suggesting that the skin’s stressors from spaceflight occur primarily in the outermost region. Space radiation can cause damage to DNA directly through interaction of charged particles with DNA itself or indirectly through the production of free radicals (which we also see from the increased oxidative stress transcripts)62. The type of DNA damage can also differ, from single-strand to double-strand breaks, chromosome aberrations, copy number variation, and other genomic changes. The level of DNA repair depends on the cell type and its capacity for repair as well, with more rapidly replicating cell types (e.g., epithelial cells vs. endothelial cells) having more active DNA repair mechanisms63. Of note, spaceflight can also cause increased reactive oxygen species production, likely also from radiation exposure64–68. We also identify specific keratin (KRT) transcripts in dermal layer and loss of fibroblast and cell junction transcripts includingDES, ACTA2, TLN1, and TAGLNin vascular regions, which may be related to epithelial barrier disruptions and hindered regeneration. Various spaceflight and ground-analog studies have shown spaceflight induces oxidative damage to cell junctional proteins and adhesion. Further supporting epithelial barrier disruptions, we show decrease in barrier-related transcripts (i.e.,FLG, HAS, OCLN, CLDN) and relate the loss of these proteins to microbiome changes using metagenomics and metatranscriptomics data from the swabs. Some of these changes may be related to the changes in skin microbiota. Consistent to previous reports from the International Space Station (ISS), we find changes in microbes such asCorynebacterium,Actinomyces, andStaphylococcusin the Inspiration4 crew skin samples, despite the small sample size69. We then correlated microbiome changes with gene expression fluctuations and identified gene-microbe clusters. While many of these changes are known to be associated with the microbial composition within the capsule, systematic studies spanning spaceflight environment, skin surface, and gene expression will provide additional insights to which countermeasures are needed70,71. Related to this observation, the changes in the microvascular network seen (both blood and lymphatic), may also be suggestive of local tissue adaptations resulting from fluid redistribution and interstitial pressure changes. It has been previously shown that microgravity-induced capillary transmural pressure (blood to tissue) change may reduce lymphatic flow and is discussed in the context of ocular health8,75. These changes in lymphatic flow and cellular microenvironment are also crucial for immune and stem cell interactions and turnovers, therefore deeper investigations to characterize the changes and develop countermeasures are crucial76,77. Overall, we present a thorough model of skin tissue (1) interacting with microbes and viruses on the surface, (2) changing expression profiles layer-by-layer, and (3) signaling from circulating PBMCs that likely interact with the peripheral skin vasculature. Our study is limited by four crew members, two timepoints, and a short-term mission, but to mediate this limitation, the data has been compared with other research and analog models (Henry Cope and Jonas Elsborg et al.,Nature Communications, in review). In addition, some limitations are due to the unique challenges associated with the astronaut samples, including: their difficult procurement (biopsy), their rarity (there are few missions being conducted), and limited infrastructure for on-site sample collection and processing78–83. Nonetheless, these first structural and molecular views into the epidermal response to spaceflight highlight key KRAS, immune, and related pathways that can be integrated in the future missions and on-site monitoring of crews84to help researchers understand the long-term effects of the spaceflight stressors and cellular changes we identified in this study. The research in this manuscript complies with all relevant ethical regulations. Tissue samples were provided by SpaceX Inspiration4 crew members (n= 4, two males and two females) after consent for research use of the biopsies, swabs, and biological materials. The procedure followed guidelines set by Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and operated under Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved protocols. Experiments were conducted in accordance with local regulations and with the approval of the IRB at the Weill Cornell Medicine (IRB #21-05023569). The biopsies were collected from all four crew members’ right (preflight) and left (postflight) deltoid (or upper arm) that were anatomically the same, matched locations, except for one crew member. For this crew member, both timepoints were collected from the right arm, approximately 1.5 inches away from one another. The average age of the crew members was 41.5 and consisted of two males and two females. Prior to biopsy, the selected areas were swabbed for 30 s with pressure using an Isohelix Swab dampened with DNase and RNase free water. The swabs were stored in the pre-labeled Thermo Fisher 2D barcoded tubes with DNA/RNA Shield Stabilization Solution (Zymo Research, cat# R1100-250) added. After the swab, the area was disinfected using CloraPrep (BD Biosciences) followed by injection of 1% lidocaine and 1/100,000 epinephrine. The biopsies were performed using a trephine punch (Miltex). If desired, the surgical sites were either closed with two 5-0 Vicryl sutures or applied pressure to stop bleeding. To prevent infection and allow healing, bacitracin ointment or sterile petrolatum was applied to the biopsied site followed by Band-Aids and after-care instructions. The resected piece was cut into approximately 1/3 and 2/3 sections. The smaller piece was fixed with formalin and stored at room temperature for histology and pathology. The larger piece was flash frozen for GeoMx analysis. For each crew member, 8 ml of venous blood was collected in Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) anticoagulant tubes. Depletion of granulocytes was performed either directly from whole blood using the RosetteSepTMgranulocyte depletion cocktail or by cell sorting after PBMC isolation. Whole blood was incubated in a granulocyte depletion cocktail (50 µl/ml of blood) for 20 min at room temperature. Next, Ficoll-Paque Plus (Cytiva) was utilized to isolate PBMCs by density gradient centrifugation. After washes in PBS with 2% FBS (GIBCO) were completed, isolated PBMCs were cell sorted to remove granulocytes only if the RosetteSepTMgranulocyte depletion cocktail was not added to whole blood prior to density gradient centrifugation. Granulocytes were identified using side scatter and the lymphocyte and monocyte fractions were sorted using a 100 µm nozzle (BD Aria). Following granulocyte depletion, PBMCs were split into two fractions to generate single-cell V(D)J T-cell and B-cell libraries or Multiome (GEX and ATAC) libraries. Spatial transcriptomics analysis GeoMx digital spatial profiling Skin biopsy samples from four crew members were collected and frozen in cryovials pre and post flight. Collected skin was flash embedded in OCT blocks. Three or four replicate of OCT-embedded tissues were placed on a single slide per subject including pre and post flight replicates. Tissues were then cryosectioned at 5 µm thickness and attached to glass microscope slides (Fisher Scientific, cat# 22-037-246). PBMC single-cell sequencing analysis Library preparation and sequencing To capture T cell and B cell variability, diversity, and joining (VDJ) repertoire, single-cell gel beads-in-emulsion and libraries were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 5’ v2, 10x Genomics). Prior to single-cell Multiome ATAC and gene expression sequencing, nuclei isolation was performed by resuspending PBMCs in 100 µl of cold lysis buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Tween-20, 0.1% Nonidet P40, 0.01% digitonin, 1% BSA, 1 mM DTT and 1 U/µl RNAse inhibitor. Cells were incubated for 4 min on ice, followed by the addition of 1 ml cold wash buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Tween-20, 1% BSA, 0.1% Tween-20, 1 mM DTT, 1 U/µl RNAse inhibitor). After centrifugation (1000 ×gfor 5 min at 4 °C), nuclei were resuspended in diluted nuclei buffer (10x Genomics Single-Cell Multiome ATAC kit A) at a concentration of 6000 nuclei per µl. Single-cell libraries were generated via the Chromium Next GEM Single-Cell Multiome ATAC and Gene Expression kit (10X Genomics) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The libraries were sequenced on the NovaSeq 6000 sequencing system. GEX and ATAC libraries were processed using Cell Ranger arc v2.0.0. VDJ libraries were processed using Cell Ranger v6.1.1. Reads were aligned to the GRCh38 human genome. Metagenomics and metatranscriptomics analysis DNA/RNA library preparation and sequencing Samples were collected prior to processing as isohelix swabs stored in 400 ul of Zymo Research DNA/RNA shield (cat# R1100) in Thermo Fisher Matrix 1.0 ml ScrewTop Tubes (cat# 3741-WP1D-BR). Prior to beginning the extraction protocol, samples were vortexed for 5 s using the MO BIO Vortex Adapter tube holder (cat# 13000-V1-24) to ensure maximum biomolecular yield from the collected swabs. Due to loss in DNA/RNA shield during sample collection, sample volume was transferred into AllPrep Bacterial Bead Tubes provided by the Qiagen Allprep Bacterial DNA/RNA/Protein Kit (cat# 47054) and the volume of samples were adjusted to 350 ul prior to further processing to ensure sufficient input volume for the extraction protocol. DNA/RNA/Protein extraction was performed using the Qiagen Allprep Bacterial DNA/RNA/Protein Kit (cat# 47054). Steps one and two were omitted from the Qiagen Allprep Bacterial DNA/RNA/Protein Kit manufacturer’s protocol as these samples were not generated through bacterial culture. Aside from this omission, samples were extracted following the manufacturer’s protocol. Following the completion of the extraction protocol, the extracted DNA was quantified using Thermo Fisher Qubit 1X dsDNA HS Assay (cat#Q33231), extracted RNA was quantified using Thermo Fisher Qubit RNA HS Assay Kit (cat#Q32855), and extracted protein was measured using the Thermo Fisher Rapid Gold BCA Protein Assay (cat #A53225). All quantification protocols were conducted per manufacturer’s instructions. Illumina DNA Library prep kit was used for preparing all extracted DNA and cDNA (from RNA) samples for Illumina Whole genome sequencing per manufacturer’s instructions. Adapters used were IDT® for Illumina® DNA/RNA UD Indexes, Tagmentation (96 Indexes, 96 Samples). In total, 408 DNA samples (4 × 96-well plates and 24 samples on a 5th 96-well plate) were library prepared and pooled into a total of 4 pools—96 samples were pooled into 1 (for plates 1, 2 and 3), except for plates 4 and 5, where 120 libraries were pooled into 1. Each library pool was sequenced using 2 × 150 Paired end sequencing on S4 flow cell using NovaSeq 6000 sequencer, one pool per lane of the S4 flow cell. Genomic data preprocessing and quality control All metagenomic and metatranscriptomic samples underwent the same quality control pipeline prior to downstream analysis. Software used was run with the default settings unless otherwise specified. The majority of our quality control pipeline makes use of bbtools (V38.92), starting with clumpify [parameters: optical = f, dupesubs = 2, dedupe = t] to group reads, bbduk [parameters: qout = 33 trd = t hdist = 1 k = 27 ktrim = “r” mink = 8 overwrite = true trimq = 10 qtrim = “rl” threads = 10 minlength = 51 maxns = −1 minbasefrequency = 0.05 ecco = f] to remove adapter contamination, and tadpole [parameters: mode = correct, ecc = t, ecco = t] to remove sequencing error79. Unmatching reads were removed using bbtool’s repair function. Alignment to the human genome with Bowtie2 (parameters: --very-sensitive-local) was done to remove potentially human-contaminating reads80. Taxonomic abundance quantification We used the XTree (https://github.com/GabeAl/UTree) [parameters: –redistribute] to quantify the bacterial and viral taxonomic compositions of the metagenomic and metatranscriptomic samples. XTree is the recent version of Utree81; it implements an optimized alignment approach and increased ease of use. In brief, XTree is a k-mer based aligner (akin to Kraken282, but faster and designed for larger databases) that uses capitalist read redistribution in order to pick the highest-likelihood mapping between a read and a given reference based on the overall support of all reads in a sample for said reference83. Notably, it reports the total coverage of a given query genome, as well as total unique coverage, which refers to coverage of regions found in only one genome of an entire genome database. We generated an XTree k-mer database [parameters: XTree BUILD k 29 comp 0] from the Genome Taxonomy Database representative species dataset (Release 207) and aligned both metagenomic and metatranscriptomic samples. For the metagenomic sequencing, we filtered for genomes that had at least 0.5% coverage (i.e., approximately 15 genes in 3000 genes, each 1000 bp) and/or 0.25% unique coverage. Relative abundances were calculated by dividing the total reads assigned to a given genome by the total number of reads assigned to all genomes in each sample. Biochemical assays from the serum samples obtained from the same i4 crew members was performed using the bead-based multiplexed assay protocols provided by Eve Technologies (https://www.evetechnologies.com/cytokine/). Two biomarker profiling panels were used: (1) Human Cytokine/Chemokine 71-Plex Discovery Assay® Array (HD71) and (2) Human Cardiovascular Disease Panel 3 9-Plex Discovery Assay® Array (HDCVD9). Concentration values from the assay were extrapolated using a 4 of 5 parameter logic standard curve. Chromogenic in situ hybridization Using additional sections from the same FFPE blocks, AP3B1 transcripts were quantified using custom RNA probe. Five-micron thick sections were cut from the paraffin blocks and mounted on glass slides. For each block two duplicate serial sections were mounted on a single slide, stained, and analyzed. Chromogenic in situ hybridization was performed on an automated stainer (Leica Bond RX, Leica Biosystems, Deer Park, IL) with RNAscope 2.5 LS Assay Reagent Kit-Red (Cat. # 322150, Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Newark, CA) and Bond Polymer Refine Red Detection (Cat. # DS9390, Leica Biosystems) following manufacturer’s standard protocol. A probe was designed to detect region 301-1333 of human AP3B1 gene, NCBI Reference Sequence 126221 (Cat. # 1262218-C1; Advanced Cell Diagnostics). Positive control probe detecting a housekeeping gene (human PPIB, cat # 313908, Advanced Cell Diagnostics) and a negative control probe detecting bacterial (Bacillus subtilis) dapB gene (cat #312038, Advanced Cell Diagnostics) were used to confirm adequate RNA preservation and detection, and absence of non-specific signal, respectively. The chromogen was fast red and the counterstain hematoxylin. Positive RNA hybridization was identified as discrete, punctate chromogenic red dots under brightfield microscopy. Images were acquired with an Olympus VS200 slides scanner and VS200 ASW 3.4.1 software (Evident Scientific, Hamburg, Germany) using a 40X/0.95NA objective and extended focal imaging mode to generate whole slide images with a pixel size of 0.1369 µm. Images were analyzed using Halo 3.5.3577 software and ISH module 4.2.3 (Indica Labs, Albuquerque, NM). The entire epidermis region was annotated manually and analyzed. As melanin pigment was observed in the epidermis it was set as an exclusion stain in order to avoid its false detection as red stain. Probe size was set at 1.0000 µm2. Average probe copy number per cell was reported. Image acquisition and analysis were performed by a board-certified veterinary pathologist.
