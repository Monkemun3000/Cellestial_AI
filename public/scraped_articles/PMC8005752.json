Hedlund, University of Nevada, Las Vegas, United States Reviewed by: Jian-Yu Jiao, Sun Yat-sen University, China; En-Min Zhou, Sun Yat-sen University, China *Correspondence: Clay C. C. Wang,clayw@usc.edu Kasthuri Venkateswaran,kjvenkat@jpl.nasa.gov This article was submitted to Extreme Microbiology, a section of the journal Frontiers in Microbiology Received 2020 Dec 8; Accepted 2021 Feb 22; Collection date 2021. Four strains belonging to the family ofMethylobacteriaceaewere isolated from different locations on the International Space Station (ISS) across two consecutive flights. Of these, three were identified as Gram-negative, rod-shaped, catalase-positive, oxidase-positive, motile bacteria, designated as IF7SW-B2T, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5, whereas the fourth was identified asMethylorubrum rhodesianum. The sequence similarity of these three ISS strains, designated as IF7SW-B2T, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5, was <99.4% for 16S rRNA genes and <97.3% forgyrBgene, with the closest beingMethylobacterium indicumSE2.11T. Furthermore, the multi-locus sequence analysis placed these three ISS strains in the same clade ofM. indicum.The average nucleotide identity (ANI) values of these three ISS strains were <93% and digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) values were <46.4% with any describedMethylobacteriumspecies. Based on the ANI and dDDH analyses, these three ISS strains were considered as novel species belonging to the genusMethylobacterium.The three ISS strains showed 100% ANI similarity and dDDH values with each other, indicating that these three ISS strains, isolated during various flights and from different locations, belong to the same species. These three ISS strains were found to grow optimally at temperatures from 25 to 30°C, pH 6.0 to 8.0, and NaCl 0 to 1%. Phenotypically, these three ISS strains resembleM. aquaticumandM. terraesince they assimilate similar sugars as sole carbon substrate when compared to otherMethylobacteriumspecies. Fatty acid analysis showed that the major fatty acid produced by the ISS strains are C18:1−ω7cand C18:1−ω6c. The predominant quinone was ubiquinone 10, and the major polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, and an unidentified lipid. Therefore, based on genomic, phylogenetic, biochemical, and fatty acid analyses, strains IF7SW-B2T, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5, are assigned to a novel species within the genusMethylobacterium, and the nameMethylobacterium ajmaliisp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is IF7SW-B2T(NRRL B-65601Tand LMG 32165T). The genusMethylobacteriumcontains more species than any other genera within the familyMethylobacteriaceae, orderRhizobiales, and classAlphaproteobacteria(Kelly et al., 2014).Methylobacteriumspecies are Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacteria. The genus was first proposed byPatt et al. (1976)withMethylobacterium organophilumas the type species. The genusMethylobacteriumwas first emended to include facultative methylotrophs that have the ability to grow on methane or methanol as the source of carbon and energy, in addition to sugars and organic acids (Patt et al., 1976). Another taxonomic study classified all other previously known pink-pigmented facultative methylotrophic bacteria under the genusMethylobacterium(Green and Bousfield, 1982). Thereafter, 11 species from the genusMethylobacteriumwere redefined into a new genus proposed asMethylorubrum, based on 16S rRNA gene sequence, multi-locus sequence analysis (MLSA), genomic, and phenotypic data (Green and Ardley, 2018). The genusMethylobacteriumconsists of 45 recognized species, which are ubiquitously present in a wide variety of habitats including air, soil, freshwater, and sediments, and can exist either in free-form or associated with plant tissues (Gallego et al.,2005a,b;Kang et al., 2007;Veyisoglu et al., 2013;Kelly et al., 2014;Kwak et al., 2014;Chaudhry et al., 2016;Green and Ardley, 2018;Park et al., 2018).Methylobacteriumspecies are involved in nitrogen fixation, phosphate solubilization, abiotic stress tolerance, plant growth promotion, and biocontrol activity against plant pathogens (Madhaiyan et al., 2006;Kumar M. et al., 2016;Parasuraman et al., 2019;Grossi et al., 2020;Krug et al., 2020). For instance, a novelMethylobacteriumsp. 2A was observed to result in higher density of lateral roots in inoculated potato crops, even under salt stress conditions, compared with control plants that were not inoculated with the bacteria; it was also found to exhibit biocontrol activity against several plant pathogens (Grossi et al., 2020). Furthermore, genomic analysis ofMethylobacteriumsp. 2A revealed the presence of metabolic pathways involved in plant growth promotion, including the genes for producing an auxin, 3-indole acetic acid (Grossi et al., 2020). In an ongoing Microbial Tracking experiment on the International Space Station (ISS), four strains belonging to the familyMethylobacteriaceaewere isolated (Checinska Sielaff et al., 2019). Some of theMethylobacteriumspecies that are phylogenetically related to these ISS strains have been isolated from plant sources (Kang et al., 2007;Chaudhry et al., 2016), indicating that the ISS strains might also display properties related to plant growth promotion. The objectives of this study were to generate whole genome sequences (WGS) and define the phylogenetic novelty of the ISSMethylobacteriumstrains using polyphasic taxonomic analyses. The WGS generated and annotated in this study was used to predict biotechnologically useful genetic determinants. Sample Collection and Isolation of Bacteria Several surface samples (1 m2) were collected from the ISS during Microbial Tracking–1 flight experiments from 2015 to 2016. Sample collection, processing, and isolation of cultivable microorganisms were published elsewhere (Checinska Sielaff et al., 2019). Briefly, the polyester wipes used to collect samples and particulates associated with the sampling devices were transported to Earth before being disassociated into sterile phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) solution and plated onto R2A agar medium (Checinska et al., 2015;Checinska Sielaff et al., 2019). The microbial cultures that were grown at 25°C for 7 days were picked from the R2A plates, purified, and stored for further analyses. Distinct colonies (n= 4) isolated from three different locations and from a high-efficiency particulate arrestance (HEPA) filter were characterized during this study. These colonies exhibited unique coloration and differential genomic phylogeny. The type strain IF7SW-B2Twas isolated during Flight 1 (March 2015) at Location #7, the Overhead-3 panel surface of the Materials Science Research Rack 1, which is used for basic materials research in the microgravity environment of the ISS. The second strain, IIF1SW-B5, was isolated during Flight 2 (May 2015) at Location #1, the Port panel of the Cupola. The Cupola is a small module devoted to the observation of operations outside the ISS, such as robotic activities, spacecraft approaches, and extravehicular activities. The third strain, IIF4SW-B5, was isolated during Flight 2 (May 2015) at Location #4, the surface of the dining table. Even though the main function of the table was for dining, crewmembers also used the table for experimental work. The fourth strain was I1-R3, isolated from the ISS HEPA filter that was returned aboard STS-134/ULF6 in May 2011 and archived as reported earlier (Checinska et al., 2015). DNA Extraction and Whole Genome Sequencing Analysis A biomass of approximately 1 μg wet weight was collected for DNA extraction from each strain after growing on R2A medium at 25°C for 3 days. Total nucleic acid extraction was carried out using ZymoBIOMICS 96 MagBead DNA kit (lysis tubes) (Zymo Research, United States) after bead beating with a Bertin Precellys homogenizer. This was followed by library preparation using the Illumina Nextera Flex Protocol as per Illumina document number 1000000025416 v07. The initial amount of DNA for library preparation was quantified, and 5 to 12 cycles of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification were carried out to normalize the output depending on the input DNA concentration. The amplified genomic DNA fragments were indexed and pooled in 384-plex configuration. Whole-genome shotgun sequencing was performed on a NovaSeq 6000 S4 flowcell PE 2 × 150 platform with a paired-end module. The data were filtered with NGS QC Toolkit v2.3 (Patel and Jain, 2012) for high-quality (HQ) vector- and adaptor-free reads for genome assembly (cutoff read length for HQ, 80%; cutoff quality score, 20). The number of filtered reads obtained were used for assembly with SPAdes 3.14.0 (Bankevich et al., 2012) genome assembler (k-mer size- 32 to 72 bases) using default parameters. The genome was annotated using the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline 4.11 (Tatusova et al., 2016;Haft et al., 2018). In addition, functional annotation of genome and seed categories were assigned to the genome by implementing the Rapid Annotations using Subsystems Technology (RAST) tool (Aziz et al., 2008). Genomes of all other strains used in this study were downloaded from NCBI, and the genomic relatedness of ISS strains was identified based on average nucleotide identity (ANI; FastANI) calculations (Jain et al., 2018) and digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) analysis (Meier-Kolthoff et al., 2013). FastANI was run on all the genomes using the default parameters: Mashmap identity cutoffI0= 80%, non-overlapping fragments of sizel=3Kb, and minimum count of reciprocal mappingsτ= 50. Phylogenetic analysis was carried out based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and MLSA using six housekeeping genes: ATP synthase F1 beta subunit (atpD), DNA strand exchange and recombination gene (recA), chaperone gene (dnaK), DNA-directed RNA polymerase subunit beta (rpoB), glutamine synthetase type I (glnI), and DNA gyrase subunit B (gyrB), for differentiatingMethylobacteriumspecies (Green and Ardley, 2018). The 16S rRNA gene sequences of type strains of all 45Methylobacteriumspecies were included in the phylogenetic analysis. In addition, representative species of genusMethylorubrum,Enterovirga,Microvirga, andNeomegalonemafrom familyMethylobacteriaceae,Rhizobiumfrom orderRhizobiales,Caulobacterfrom orderCaulobacterales, in classAlphaproteobacteriawere included.Pseudomonas aeruginosawas selected as the outgroup. The 16S rRNA gene sequences of all strains were retrieved from NCBI except for the four ISS strains, which were recovered from their respective WGS. Phylogenetic analysis based on housekeeping genes and MLSA was carried out with type strains of 24Methylobacteriumspecies and representative species of other genera. All the gene sequences were retrieved from the genome sequences using RAST v2.01(Aziz et al., 2008;Overbeek et al., 2014;Brettin et al., 2015). The individual gene sequences for all strains were aligned separately using ClustalW, and then the maximum likelihood tree was generated using MEGA 7.0.26 (Kumar S. et al., 2016). For MLSA, six housekeeping gene sequences for each strain were concatenated manually and aligned using ClustalW, and then the maximum likelihood tree was generated using MEGA 7.0.26 (Kumar S. et al., 2016). The genome-based tree for theMethylobacteriumspecies, including ISS strains and representative species of other genus with available WGS, was constructed using GToTree (Lee, 2019). This tool takes the complete/draft genomes as input and creates a phylogenomic tree based on the prespecified single-copy gene set using a hidden Markov model (HMM); the tool currently has 2,044 unique HMM set as identifiers to cover all three domains of microbial life. Phenotypic Characterization of ISS Strains Phenotypic characterization was performed according to standard protocols (Jones, 1981). Growth of the ISS strains at different temperatures (7, 25, 30, 37, and 45°C) was assessed after incubation on nutrient agar (Sigma, United States) for 7 days. Growth at different pH (4.0–10.0 at intervals of 1.0) was assessed after incubation in nutrient broth (Sigma, United States) at 30°C for 7 days. The pH of the nutrient medium was adjusted using citrate/NaH2PO4buffer (pH 4.0–5.0), phosphate buffer (pH 6.0–8.0), and tris buffer (pH 9.0–10.0) (Kim et al., 2019). Salt tolerance was tested by streaking the strains on R2A supplemented with NaCl (0–10% at intervals of 1%) and incubating the plates at 30°C for 7 days. Motility was assessed via the “hanging drop” method by observing the culture under a light microscope (Tindall et al., 2007). Catalase activity was tested by adding 3% hydrogen peroxide to culture grown on R2A at 30°C for 7 days, and effervescence was monitored (Tindall et al., 2007). An oxidase test was carried out in a filter paper soaked with the substrate tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride, and coloration was documented (Jurtshuk Jr. and McQuitty, 1976). All other physiological and biochemical tests were carried out using API 20 NE, API 50 CH, and API ZYM kits as per manufacturer’s procedures (bioMérieux, France). All strains grown in the R2A broth were harvested when growth of the cultures reached around 70% of the maximal optical density (exponential growth phase), and then the cultures were used for analyses of cellular fatty acids, polar lipids, and quinones, which were carried out as described previously (Ramaprasad et al., 2015). Briefly, for cellular fatty acids analysis, 40 mg of bacterial cell pellet from each strain was subjected to a series of four different reagents followed by saponification and methylation of fatty acids, thus enabling their cleavage from lipids. The fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) thus obtained were analyzed by a gas chromatograph equipped with Sherlock MIS software (Microbial ID; MIDI 6.0 version; Agilent: 6850)2. The peaks obtained were then labeled, and the equivalent chain length (ECL) values were computed by the Sherlock software. This study reports the isolation and identification of four strains belonging to the familyMethylobacteriaceae, collected from different locations on the ISS. Three of the strains, referred to as IF7SW-B2T, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5, were identified based on the traditional and genomic taxonomic approaches. The fourth strain, which was isolated from a HEPA filter and referred to as I1-R3, was identified based on genomic analyses only.

Whole Genome Sequence–Based Phylogenetic Analysis Summary of the draft whole-genome sequences of four strains belonging to the familyMethylobacteriaceae, isolated from the ISS. Genomic analyses ofMethylobacterium ajmaliiin comparison to other species of the familyMethylobacteriaceae. The fourth strain I1-R3 was identified asM. rhodesianumbased on highly similar 16S rRNA (99.9%),gyrB(100%), ANI (98.9%), and dDDH (91.6%) genomic parameters withM. rhodesianumDSM 5687T. The pigmentation of the strain I1-R3 (light pink) was also different from the novel ISSMethylobacteriumstrains (reddish pink). The ANI and dDDH values between I1-R3 and the three novel ISSMethylobacteriumstrains were ∼82% and 24%, respectively. Hence, genomic and morphological analyses confirmed the phylogenetic affiliation of strain I1-R3 asM. rhodesianum. In this communication, phylogenetic affiliations of only IF7SW-B2T, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5 strains were presented.

Genes Essential for Interaction With Plants in the ISS Strain In summary, the phylogenetic and genetic distinctiveness and differential phenotypic properties were sufficient to categorize these three ISS strains as members of a species distinct from other recognizedMethylobacteriumspecies. Therefore, on the basis of the data presented, strains IF7SW-B2T, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5 represent a novel species of the genusMethylobacterium, for which the nameMethylobacterium ajmaliisp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is IF7SW-B2T(NRRL B-65601Tand LMG 32165T). Description ofMethylobacterium ajmaliisp. nov. Methylobacterium ajmalii(aj.ma’li.i.
