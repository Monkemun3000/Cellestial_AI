Unlike typical negative gravitropic curvature, young hypocotyls ofBrassica rapaand other dicots exhibit positive gravitropism. This positive curvature occurs at the base of the hypocotyl and is followed by the typical negative gravity-induced curvature. We investigated the role of auxin in both positive and negative hypocotyl curvature by examining the transcription ofPIN1,PIN3,IAA5andARG1in curving tissue. We compared tissue extraction of the convex and concave flank with Solid Phase Gene Extraction (SPGE). Based on Ubiquitin1 (UBQ1) as a reference gene, the log (2) fold change of all examined genes was determined. Transcription of the examined genes varied during the graviresponse suggesting that these genes affect differential elongation. The transcription of all genes was upregulated in the lower flank and downregulated in the upper flank during the initial downward curving period. After 48 h, the transcription profile reversed, suggesting that the ensuing negative gravicurvature is controlled by the same genes as the positive gravicurvature. High-spatial resolution profiling using SPGE revealed that the transcription profile of the examined genes was spatially distinct within the curving tissue. The comparison of the hypocotyl transcription profile with the root tip indicated that the tip tissue is a suitable reference for curving hypocotyls and that root and hypocotyl curvature are controlled by the same physiological processes. Gravitropism is defined as a directional growth response of plants to gravity. This force affects the redistribution of statoliths (starch-filled amyloplasts) in sensory cells and determines the positioning of the plant axis during and after germination. Seedling roots grow towards gravity (aka positive gravitropism) and stems exhibit negative gravitropism and grow in the opposite direction. Although hypocotyls eventually respond as negatively gravitropic, we have previously shown that young hypocotyls ofBrassica rapaand other dicotyledonous plants exhibit positive gravitropism. This reorientation is independent of the root cap and amplifies the root graviresponse [1]. The mechanism of this atypical, early curvature has not yet been studied. Based on the hypothesis that this curvature is auxin dependent, we investigated the transcription profile of auxin-responsive genes in the curving hypocotyl tissue. The phytohormone indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) is the main growth regulator in plants that affects differential elongation [2] and is the main agent in complex processes that includes transport [3], and interaction with other phytohormones [4,5,6]. Auxin effects depend on metabolic activity [7], cytoskeletal interaction [8,9], ions [10,11,12,13], and light [14,15,16,17,18]. Auxin regulates primary and lateral root growth [19,20], branching [21], and differentiation [22]. The coordinated response to the integrative effect of these factors determines the rate and degree of curvature. Therefore, differential growth responses depend on auxin-mediated processes and gene expression. Auxin is synthesized predominantly in meristematic tissue such as shoot and root apices [23], developing seeds [24] and young leaves [25] and transported away from the site of synthesis. Auxin originating from the shoot apex is basipetally (rootward) transported to the stem tissue and basal leaves. In roots, auxin moves through the stele towards the root apex and is redistributed such that basipetal, shootward, transport takes place from the root tip through cortical tissue. The bi-directional auxin transport in roots forms the basis of the “reverse fountain model” [2]. The gravisensitive re-distribution of auxin in roots is initiated by amyloplast relocation and depends on PIN proteins. These proteins determine the direction of IAA flow based on their localization in the plasma membrane [26]. PIN proteins represent a family of proteins that are expressed in specific tissues [27]. In hypocotyls, sedimenting amyloplasts are found in the endodermis [37,38], which acts as gravisensing layer in dicots and is essential for the graviresponse [39,40,41]. PIN3 is expressed in the endodermis [28] and localizes laterally after two minutes of gravistimulation [42]. PIN3 localization is auxin dependent [43] and a mutation in thePIN3gene affects differential growth [42]. Hence,PIN3is an important factor for shoot graviresponse [43]. ThePIN3homologsPIN4andPIN7are not expressed in the shoot endodermis and their mutants do not affect the shoot graviresponse [43]. Along with PIN proteins, Altered Response to Gravity (ARG1) is required for the localization of PIN3 during the early stages of hypocotyl graviresponse [44]. A mutation inARG1affects early gravisignaling in roots and hypocotyls [45] but can be corrected by the expression of ARG1 in the endodermis of hypocotyls and root caps, which implies that it functions in statocytes [46]. PIN1 re-localization alters the lateral redistribution of auxin and affects the phototropic [47], and gravitropic response [48] andPIN1mutants show reduced polar auxin transport (PAT) inArabidopsis thalianainflorescence axes [49]. Another Auxin Response Element promotesIAA5, a member of Aux/IAA gene family, which has been identified as one of the early and primary response genes [50,51] that are governed by auxin [52]. Based on these auxin networks, we chose to compare the transcription levels ofPIN1,PIN3,IAA5andARGin vertically and horizontally reoriented hypocotyls ofBrassica rapa. Since Ubiquitin (UBQ) is highly expressed [53] and used as a reference gene [54,55,56], its transcription level was used as a reference to assess changes in the transcription of auxin responsive genes. As reported earlier [1], dicotyledonous plants such as Brassica, Radish and Flax show a bi-phasic and combined graviresponse of the root-shoot axis. The time course of curvature involves a transient curvature of the root tip. Upon straightening of the tip, the hypocotyl base begins to respond as positively gravitropic. The graviresponse is completed after about 20 h. The sampling intervals were chosen to coincide with the onset of hypocotyl curvature (four hours after reorientation), the midpoint of curvature (45-degree curvature of the hypocotyl; 11 h) and vertically oriented seedlings (48 h after the initial reorientation). 2.2. Nucleic Acid Extraction, Yield, and Reference (A) Extraction of mRNA using Solid Phase Gene Extraction: Oligo-dT15 functionalized stainless-steel needles were inserted into the upper and lower side of horizontally placed hypocotyls and the root tip of Brassica rapa seedlings. The hybridization between the dT and poly A tail of the mRNA was accomplished in 60 s. (B) Drawings that represent hypocotyl curvature during the experiments. (C) Sampling of the upper and lower flank of hypocotyl tissue. The ratio of Cq values of UBQ1 in bottom vs. top flank obtained from hypocotyl tissue (solid line) and SPGE (dashed line) after horizontal reorientation ofB. rapaseedlings. Time = 0 refers to vertical position. Transcription of UBQ1 did not change significantly after reorientation (p= 0.75); mean ± SE,n= 9. 2.3. Transcription in the Hypocotyl Base Tissue Absolute Cq values of the investigated genes PIN1, PIN3, IAA5 and ARG1 obtained after extracting tissue of the left and right flank of a vertically grownB. rapaseedlings. Mean ± SE,n= 9. Log (2) fold change in transcription level of PIN1, PIN3, IAA5 and ARG1 in tissue samples of the upper (black) and lower (red) flank of hypocotyls of horizontally reoriented Brassica rapa seedlings four and 11 h after reorientation relative to the transcription of UBQ1. The transcription was upregulated in the bottom flank and downregulated in upper flank. The least significant difference (LSD) is based on the error of all measurements per panel. Mean ± SE,n= 9. 2.4. Tissue and SPGE Extraction Comparison of transcription profiles of PIN1, PIN3, IAA5 and ARG1 inB. rapaseedlings in tissue after four and 11 h of reorientation (upper panel) and SPGE extraction (lower panel) after four, 11 and 48 h reorientation. The data for SPGE top and bottom refers to the average values of the combined probes 1, 2, 3 and 4, 5, 6, respectively. All values are shown as fold change based on UBQ1. Mean ± SE,n= 9. 2.5. Comparison of the Hypocotyl and Root Tip As illustrated [1], the hypocotyl responds to gravity in sequentially positive and then negative curvature. In contrast, the root tip always exhibits positive gravicurvature. Therefore, a comparison of both tissues shows the extent and magnitude of synchronous changes in the transcription of relevant genes. The transcription profile of PIN1, PIN3, IAA5 and ARG1 in the root tip after horizontal reorientation ofB. rapaseedlings. Data were tissue (red) or SPGE (black) sampling of the 2 mm tip region. The transcripts were referenced to UBQ1. The least significant difference (LSD) was calculated separately for tissue and SPGE samples. Mean ± SE,n= 3. 3.2. Transcription of Auxin Related Genes 3.3. Spatio-Temporal Changes during Hypocotyl Curvature Although the transcription profile 48 h after reorientation was not equal on both flanks, the data suggest that the hypocotyl curvature for the different curvatures rely on the same genes but does not address what causes the reversal of auxin sensitivity over time. However, the effect of auxin levels and ensuing gene transcription will also be affected by the cessation of the ability to elongate; therefore, the maturing tissue no longer responds to changes in auxin-mediated development and the reversal in hypocotyl curvature, i.e., negative gravitropism, depends on tissue that is still expanding. 3.4. Comparison of Root Tip and Hypocotyl This notion likely extends to other species that show a biphasic response in hypocotyl curvature. Equally important is the confirmation that the positive and negative hypocotyl curvature depends on similar hormonal signaling mechanisms as root curvature. 3.5. Comparison of RNA Extraction Techniques Seeds of Brassica rapa vs. rapa were germinated at 25 °C in darkness between germination paper that was positioned on top of five mm thick floral foam to avoid thigmotropic stimulation of roots upon emergence. Seedlings with an average root length of 10 mm were used for experimentation 42 h after imbibition. All experiments were performed in moist petri dishes. 4.2. Gravistimulation and Tissue Sampling Vertically grown and positioned seedlings were reoriented such that the entire seedling was positioned horizontally. Before reorientation and 4 and 11 h after reorientation, the hypocotyl was dissected into two parts (left/right for vertical controls and upper/lower for horizontally oriented seedlings). Samples obtained after 48 h did not include tissue samples as the tissue size after 48 h of additional growth exceeded the extraction capacity. The apical two mm of the root tip were removed using a scalpel and used as additional reference tissue. All tissue samples were immediately submersed in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA extraction of tissue (hypocotyl and 2 mm long root tip) was performed using the Sigma Spectrum™ Plant Total RNA Kit. For each time point three biological replicates with material from 20 seedlings each were analyzed. The samples were homogenized in a microfuge tube for one min in lysis solution followed by vortexing, then heated (50 °C for 5 min in a water bath) and centrifuged (16,000×g, 4 min). The supernatant was transferred into a microfuge tube containing a filter column and centrifuged (16,000×g, 90 s). The filtrate was transferred to a binding column and centrifuged at 16,000×gfor 90 s. The flow through, as well as the solution from three successive wash steps (500 µL wash buffer each), were discarded. The filter column was centrifuged to remove any remaining solution before the elution buffer was added for 1 min, followed by centrifugation (16,000×gfor 90 s). The eluant contained total RNA and was immediately put on ice. The RNA was quantified using a DeNovix DS-11 spectrophotometer. The total RNA was diluted with deionized DEPC water to a concentration of 100 ng/µL. 4.4. SPGE Probe Preparation mRNA Extraction Two µL of oligo-dTs and RNA (10 µL of total RNA or three SPGE probes) were added to a PCR tube. The tubes were heated for five min in a Thermocycler (Hybaid, PCR Express) to 80 °C. A master-mix was prepared that contained 4.2 µL deionized water for total RNA or 16.2 µL for SPGE samples. All samples contained 2 µL 10 X buffer, 0.8 µL 25 mM dNTP and 1 µL reverse transcriptase (final concentrations: 1 mM dNTP, 1X reverse transcription buffer, and 50 U MultiscribeTMreverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystem high-capacity cDNA kit). This master-mix was added to RNA/oligo dT mix (eight µL for total RNA and 20 µL for SPGE) and incubated at 25 °C for 10 min, then at 37 °C for 2 h, and deactivated at 85 °C for 5 min. cDNA was quantified using a DeNovix DS–11 spectrophotometer. 4.6.
