Such missions are currently burdened with significant anticipated crew health and safety challenges.1Coordinated research and development are crucial for producing effective countermeasures against the deleterious influences of spaceflight on the human body. To this end, we emphatically support the development of translational research efforts at NASA that will facilitate bi-directional information flow between basic and applied life sciences and medical operations with the goal to accelerate countermeasure development. As identified by National Academy committees and embedded in the NASA Strategic Plan, a sustainable human spaceflight program requires robust research at bothbasicandappliedlevels to make fundamental biological discoveries and to address the known and emerging risks to human health resulting from the spaceflight environment, respectively.2–5The Life Sciences portfolio at NASA is composed of the Space Biology program (a basic science program), the Human Research Program (HRP, an applied program), and Medical Operations (Office of Chief Health and Medical Officer). Informal translational research within these programs has taken place at NASA for decades, yet there is a need for a more coordinated effort that enables dynamic translation that can take rapid advantage of new findings. In particular, the National Academy committees recommended that NASA follows key elements of the National Institutes of Health’s (NIH) model of translational science.6,7It was specifically recommended that thecoordinationandmaturationof projects between each level of research be enhanced to increase knowledge transfer and identification of potential solutions for astronaut health challenges.2–4Additionally, the translation of knowledge to Earth-based medical care has recently begun with the designation of the ISS as a National Laboratory (currently through the Center for the Advancement of Science in Space). In this paper, we provide context for the current drivers (and needs) for translational research at NASA, briefly summarize the experience at NIH, and lay out a two-phased approach for translational research. As illustrated in Fig.1, the first phase isbasic-to-appliedand the second phase isapplied-to-operational. We define the levels of the research continuum as follows, consistent with the Decadal Survey’s Interim Report:5basic researchaims to generate new biological knowledge using biological systems or model organisms,applied researchaims to develop countermeasures for risks to astronaut health (similar to pre-clinical research), andmedical operationsputs countermeasures into practice for astronauts (like operations in the clinic). The NASA Life Sciences Translational Path. It moves from basic research to human exploration applications with bi-directionality options. As knowledge is applied along this path (top arrows) questions may arise that can best be addressed by more basic research (bottom arrows) in order to support further progress toward successful human exploration NASA’s involvement in translational research For the purposes of this paper we will focus mainly on the translation of space life sciences research knowledge to the human challenges associated with long-duration spaceflights. Our narrow translational research focus is therefore defined as the application of basic science discoveries to the development of new preventive and therapeutic approaches supporting optimized human adaptation to space missions with extended durations and distances from Earth. NASA’s human spaceflight challenges The biomedical concerns and risks of human Exploration Class missions, characterized by extended duration space exposures and travel far beyond Earth, are not yet fully understood.8Prior to an exploration mission, better definition of these risks, and the development and implementation of countermeasures must be achieved to avoid physiological and behavioral changes that could degrade the health, safety and productivity of crew members during extended ISS habitation and missions beyond Low Earth Orbit (LEO). Additionally, during exploration missions, tools are needed to monitor and manage individual and crew resiliency in the face of unplanned challenges.9 The ISS presently accommodates continuous human habitation, enabling basic and applied research and testing of new ways to thrive in space. ISS offers a unique platform that is facilitating the identification of requirements for conducting future human missions that could last for years, and the challenges associated with orbiting and even occupying other planets. Exploration Class missions beyond ISS will require detailed knowledge of what adaptations can be tolerated and those which must be countered for the long-term. These missions will also require a degree of operational resiliency and autonomy never before attempted. Human space exploration is now at a crossroads, and leaving LEO will place increasing demands on space life sciences research to support such endeavors. Key spaceflight-related environmental factors that chronically impact human health and performance during such missions are: microgravity, confinement, and exposure to space radiation.1We chose just four examples, profiled below, to demonstrate the value of translational research in addressing four specific risks identified by NASA for astronaut health and safety: immune response, microbe-host interactions, oxidative stress and damage, and visual impairment (VI) syndrome. There are many others on NASA’s list,10of course, including some in broad areas such as nutrition and sleep, and surely some not yet identified. For NASA, translational research has historically been11and is increasingly viewed as essential to better define and minimize these health risks. Translational research: pioneered by NIH NIH has pioneered the translational research challenge since about 2003.7Several NIH institutes have been established under the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences6to develop a “Translational Pipeline” linking basic research to pre-clinical and clinical investigations7,12that will lead to eventual utilization in the provision of health care. Both the NIH and NASA research portfolios cover a broad range of spatial scale and complexity, including microbiology, cell culture, model organisms, and an array of human biomedical studies (Fig.1). NASA can learn much from NIH’s endeavors, and the implementation of cooperative agreements between these agencies could provide effective bridges for knowledge sharing. Recent NASA drivers toward translational research In 2009, after consultation with NASA, Congress determined that an objective reassessment was needed of the basic and applied research capabilities and resources available to support future human space exploration. Congress mandated that the National Research Council conduct and publish a “Decadal Survey” ultimately titledRecapturing a Future for Space Exploration: Life and Physical Sciences Research for a New Era.3The Decadal Survey reviewed the research, development, and applications relevant to basic science and human space exploration. The Space Life and Physical Sciences research communities provided major input to the Decadal Survey and helped to shape its many broad recommendations. A key recommendation was to increase the integration of efforts toward conduct of cross-disciplinary, focused translational research and development with applications to human space risks and related areas supporting human space exploration. Another main recommendation was for NASA to constitute an integrated organization within NASA to manage these efforts. In 2011, the Space Life and Physical Science Research & Applications Division was established within NASA’s Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate. Key life science elements within the SLPSRA Division include the HRP and the Space Biology program (Fig.2). HRP created and maintains a dynamic Human Research Roadmap that defines known risks, mitigation capabilities, current knowledge gaps, and concepts for future work regarding astronaut health, performance, and safety.10In contrast, Space Biology focuses on defining the changes in basic biological mechanisms as a result of spaceflight and has developed a set of Guiding Questions that define its research program.13Despite the programmatic differences, there are overlapping research areas within these two programs at thebasic-to-appliedphase of translation, which are itemized in Fig.2and described below in the Examples section. Space Biology and Human Research Bi-directional Synergism. Basic Space Biology research is done mainly with lower-level model organisms, cells, and tissues. The HRP conducts biomedical science mainly with humans. They synergistically and bi-directionally collaborate in maximizing opportunities for translating a subset of that knowledge to optimize the health and safety of the crew via applications supporting medical operations The Decadal Survey panels made recommendations for research priorities throughout the lifespan of the ISS. In Chapter 6 of the Decadal Survey, theAnimal and Human Biologypanel (3) made 16 key recommendations spanning multiple systems in the body of vertebrates for conduct of basic and applied research (Table1). The panel indicated that many of these should be studied using a translational framework. Further, the panel unanimously stated that animal research be firmly integrated in the space life sciences portfolio—both within space-based and ground-based programs—to drive the translation of knowledge. Additionally, in Chapter 7 of the Decadal Survey, theIntegrative and Translational Research for the Human Systemspanel (3) made 11 recommendations related to crosscutting issues (CC) for humans in the space environment (Table2). One goal of this paper is to bring stakeholders—U.S. taxpayers, Congress, the National Academies, and relevant science communities—up to date regarding NASA’s progress in building collaborative research communities in the translational area to pursue these important recommendations.

Crosscutting Issues (CC) for Humans in the Space Environment identified in Chapter 7 of the Decadal Survey (3) Reprinted with permission from Recapturing a Future for Space Exploration: Life and Physical Sciences Research for a New Era (2011) by the National Academy of Sciences, Courtesy of the National Academies Press, Washington DC NASA’s current translational research approach Within theapplied-to-operationalphase, HRP established a Translational Research Institute, in October 2016, with a key goal to recruit funded, terrestrial biomedical research entities in furthering NASA translational research goals,18–20and to help mature countermeasures and technologies for use in medical operations. Taken together, these efforts demonstrate new activities to facilitate translation from basic science to operations. The Decadal Survey (3) provides guidance on how to structure a fully-integrated translational program by partitioning the life sciences research portfolio into two dimensions.Horizontal integrationof projects is the first dimension and requires multidisciplinary approaches to solve complex problems, often within a given organism type. The second dimension,vertical translation, requires meaningful interactions among basic, applied, and operational scientists to translate fundamental discoveries to human treatments, such as using cell biology and model organism research to address human problems, for example in immune system response challenges. The NIH experience has shown that the horizontal integration of research knowledge is essential for developing a comprehensive understanding of physiology and to effectively solve health problems.23NASA has a successful record in this domain that should continue, for example, with its BioSpecimen Sharing Programs. Researchers have recently shared tissues from specific animals on a late Shuttle mission (STS-131),24–31and the most recent Russian Bion biosatellite mission;32–35sharing was in the form of preserved tissues from NASA’s Life Sciences Data Archive.36Further, new Omic-science studies like NASA’s emerging GeneLab open-science data and biosample repository37and the recent astronaut Twins Study38enable big-data collection, analytics, and horizontal integration. Finally, restoring the gravity vector artificially via chronic whole-body centrifugation may solve issues in multiple tissues, simultaneously. In contrast, vertical translation requires that investigators along the research continuum from basic to operational (Fig.1) interact regularly to share ideas. Examples of vertical translation at NASA are in the recent International Life Sciences Research Announcement awards (NASA, European, Japanese, and Canadian space program research solicitations),39GeneLab,37and the recent call for proposals in the area of artificial gravity (AG).40All of these planned research projects span multiple levels of the translational pipeline. Additionally, vertically-integrated team science occurs through NASA Specialized Centers of Research (NSCOR)41–44and the National Space Biomedical Research Institute’s centers for radiation research,45–47which aim to identify and translate countermeasure candidates for radiation-induced insults (Table2: CC7–CC9). There is surely untapped value to be derived from additional vertical translation within NASA programs. Some existing overlap and synergism between HRP and Space Biology goals and approaches amenable to both horizontal and vertical translation are shown in Fig.2. Informally, vertical translation has occurred at NASA for many years11with a conceptual maturation path shown in Fig.1. For example, molecular mechanisms underlying the bone loss resulting from musculoskeletal disuse have been demonstrated in ground-based models,48–50responding to recommendations AH2-4 (Table1). Further, two precursors to osteoporosis drugs have been tested in space-flown or ground-based mice and shown to be effective at preventing weightlessness-induced bone loss,49–51responsive to recommendations AH2, AH4 (Table1). Thus, these drugs give HRP and Medical Operations additional potential countermeasures besides exercise52and Alendronate53to combat bone loss during spaceflight. Additional specific examples of vertical translation are described in the examples below. Examples of NASA life sciences basic-to-applied translational research Progress in four specific areas is profiled below, each of which is a NASA “Health and Human Performance Risk for Space Exploration”.8All demonstrate linkages between basic and applied research and involve on-going collaborations between Space Biology and the HRP. These examples illustrate ongoing opportunities for synergy between basic and applied researchers and these NASA programs to enhance and accelerate health-risk reduction. The immune system is constantly adapting and is particularly responsive to unique environments such as those in spaceflight, especially for exposures of the long durations required by exploration missions beyond LEO. Immune system dysregulation (decreased responsiveness) has been seen during and after spaceflight and ground-space analog tests by studying humans,54animals,55and relevant cell cultures56and are a priority area for study (AH13-15, Table1). The specific causes are not yet clear, but are likely linked to one or more of the following factors: physiological stress, circadian rhythm disruption, microgravity exposure, isolation, altered nutrition, or radiation exposure.57Further, the spaceflight environment compounds crew health risks as some microorganisms become more virulent (see below) and resistant to antibiotic drugs. Even though the reactivation of latent viruses has been well documented in crewmembers,58it is still unclear if the compromised immune response can lead to increased susceptibility to disease. There is not a sufficiently accurate ground-based analog to study immune suppression from spaceflight. However, extreme occupational environments such as Antarctica winter-over and the Aquarius undersea station enable aspects of immune dysregulation to be studied under similar stressors. Additionally, many valuable analog studies with animals and cells have been conducted, including unloading of rodents,59and cell cultures and bioreactors.56,60These studies have investigated immune response mechanisms and can allow the use of controlled diets, increased radiation levels and other factors that are not possible in human research. The novel environmental conditions of spaceflight, and their combination, may affect both the generation and safe processing of reactive oxygen or nitrogen species.72,73Evidence for oxidative-related issues in astronauts (or their analogs) can be found in the HRP Evidence Reports covering inadequate nutrition,74extravehicular activity,75and exposure to ionizing radiation.47,76–79NASA has successfully used horizontally-integrated team science to understand and mitigate components of radiation-induced oxidative stress42–44in mice. Visual impairment/intracranial pressure (VI/IP) During and after long-duration spaceflights, some astronauts have reported noticeable, persistent VIs accompanied by ophthalmic changes including globe flattening, choroidal folds, optic-disc edema, and optic-nerve kinking.80To date, clinically significant changes have been observed in male, but not female, astronauts,81identifying a not yet understood sex difference, CC10 (Table2). Increased intracranial pressure and optic-disc swelling (papilledema) may underlie these potentially irreversible changes.81Current research is analyzing the effects of lowering cranial hypertension by using lower body negative pressure in astronauts during flight and bedrest,82supporting the CC2 goal (Table2). Clinical signs and symptoms observed in astronauts have informed and focused important mechanistic studies exemplifying reciprocal translation at NASA (i.e., applied to basic). For example, retinas of female mice flown on the shuttle (STS-133, STS-135), acquired by the BioSpecimen Sharing Program, exhibit altered gene expression and increased oxidative stress,83possibly causing retinal damage, degeneration, or remodeling.84,85Other basic research is examining morphological, histological, and molecular changes in the brains and eyes of rats exposed to head-down tilt.86 Altogether, these examples are in the early stages of mechanistic understanding and countermeasure development. Already each has benefited from translational approaches. We suggest that a more coordinated programmatic effort of horizontal and vertical integration will accelerate countermeasure development. In the closing section, we provide suggestions of how enhanced translational research could materialize at NASA. Options for NASA’s future translational research path Given the need for acute astronaut countermeasures to enable longer-duration missions, we recommend the following steps to catalyze translational research within NASA’s Life Sciences portfolio. Building and managing partnerships Greater coordinated efforts in translational research are needed to understand and manage the integrated organismal response to spaceflight and enable human exploration. Current activities within NASA’s SLPSRA Division are creating new opportunities for translational science both within and external to the Agency. Tools like text analytics should aid in managing the life sciences portfolio and identify new gaps in knowledge. Other government agencies, such as NIH, and other organizations, both commercial and non-profit, have been working for a number of years on Earth-based translational research goals. NASA should partner, both nationally and internationally, with external organizations to benefit from their tools, techniques, and experience, and add NASA-unique data and translational research efforts to the much larger, continually growing, and worldwide community of translational research science. NASA’s Human Research and Space Biology programs should increasingly encourage translational research proposals for upcoming NASA research announcements (NRAs),87including proposals that span traditional program boundaries or team science proposals (horizontally or vertically-integrated teams of investigators like the NSCORs or resembling the P01 Program Project Grants offered by NIH). Additionally, phased awards allowing progression from hypothesis-driven science to countermeasure development would enable vertical translation across NASA’s life sciences portfolio (Figs.1,2). Finally, proposals with international collaborations are encouraged to leverage the ISS platform and unique national resources (see the open NRAs and the International Space Life Sciences Working Group for research announcements). NASA’s open science and data sharing Open Science approaches, allowing transparency and data sharing at all levels of society, are being developed at NASA to provide greater access to data and tissue sharing from both space and ground-based research. The goal is to engage researchers both within and outside of the NASA community (e.g., academia, NIH, Department of Defense, etc). These steps are essential for both optimizing the use of these valuable resources and facilitating translational research goals. NASA should continue the development and expansion of Open Science systems, such as GeneLab, to enable translational research for the broadest research community. Education, communications, and advocacy Increased activity in the Education, Communication, and Advocacy areas will be fundamental to achieve translational research goals and is a mandate of the HRP Translational Research Institute. Additionally, organizations such as the ASGSR are discussing options to engage their members who span biology, human research, physical sciences, life support, related technology development, and commercial applications in translational research pursuits. NASA should develop research fellowships, as well as educational and scientific communication materials specifically tailored to the Agency’s translational research goals and partner with external organizations, wherever possible, to leverage the advocacy those organizations can provide. In summary, translation research is a two-phased effort at NASA and will help accelerate countermeasure development for exploration missions. We have specified four areas where synergy within the existing program structures seems promising and have suggested ways in which program coordination and team science approaches can facilitate translation from discovery to development to implementation.
