  "content": "A Region of UNC-89 (obscurin) Lying Between Two Protein Kinase Domains is a Highly Elastic Spring Required for Proper Sarcomere Organization Corresponding author: Guy M. Benian, 404-727-5953,pathgb@emory.edu, Department of Pathology, Emory University, Whitehead Biomedical Research Building 105E, 615 Michael Street, Atlanta, Georgia 30322 USA C. elegansUNC-89 is the founding member of the UNC-89/obscurin family of giant muscle proteins. Loss-of-function mutations in theC. elegansgeneunc-89result in slow moving worms with disorganized muscle sarcomeres, including a lack of M-lines [1–3].unc-89is a complex gene: through the use of three promoters and alternative splicing at least 16 polypeptides are generated, ranging in size from 156,000 to 900,000 Da [3–5]. Overlapping sets of isoforms are expressed in body wall muscle, pharyngeal muscle (for pumping in and grinding up bacterial food), egg laying and intestinal muscles [3], and several gonadal epithelial cells [6]. The largest of these isoforms, UNC-89-B and UNC-89-F, consist of 53 Ig domains, two Fn3 domains, a triplet of SH3, DH and PH domains near their N-termini, and two protein kinase domains (PK1 and PK2) near their C termini. Antibodies localize UNC-89 to the M-line [3,4]. To learn how UNC-89 is localized and performs its functions, our lab has systematically identified its binding partners. We have screened a yeast two hybrid library with segments representing the largest UNC-89 isoform and identified at least 7 interacting partners, and 6/7 have orthologs or homologs in humans [7–13]. Interactions have been verified by a combination of demonstrating binding in vitro using purified recombinant proteins, co-immunolocalization, and identifying muscle mutant phenotypes. Fig. 1. Schematic representation of domain organization around kinase domains, and secondary structure predictions for the interkinase regions of nematode UNC-89, mouse obscurin and SPEG. (A) Domain organization from PFAM predictions. Note that each protein, near its C-terminus consists of a protein kinase, a non-domain “interkinase” region (647–742 residues), Ig and Fn domains, and a second protein kinase domain. (B) Secondary structure predictions of the non-domain interkinase regions of UNC-89, obscurin and SPEG using JPred. Given the nature of the amino acid sequence of the IK region of UNC-89, we wished to determine how it might respond to a mechanical pulling force using the single molecule force spectroscopy technique. To carry this out, we first expressed in E. coli 1 571 residue segment comprising the majority of the 645 residue interkinase region (IK) flanked on the N- and C-terminus by two copies of Ig27 from human titin. The response of Ig27 to pulling force is well documented and served as an internal control. In addition, the protein had a 6XHis tag at its N-terminus (Fig. 2A). After purification (Fig. 2B), the protein was allowed to attach to a glass surface coated with Ni2+-NTA to allow binding of the N-terminus of this polyprotein via its 6XHis tag. The stylus of the single-molecule force spectrometer was allowed to bind non-specifically and at random points along the polyprotein, and then pulling force was applied by moving the piezo-electric platform downward. A representative force curve of the mechanical unfolding of the polyprotein in which the stylus had attached to the C-terminus is shown inFig. 2C. After a long and featureless trace without energy barriers, the typical unwinding of the 4 Ig domains is found. The statistical distribution of the contour length of the long featureless peak (Fig. 2D) shows that the mean contour is approximately 185 nm. This is a good match to the expected contour length of a fully unwound polypeptide of 571 amino acids, since the average length of an amino acid is 0.34 nm, i.e. 0.34 nm/aa × 571 aa = 194 nm. Based on this force curve and contour length, we can conclude that the IK has the mechanical properties of a random coil and behaves like an entropic spring. Fig. 2. The interkinase region (IK) of UNC-89 is a highly elastic spring. (A) Polyprotein construct encompassing the IK flanked on either side by two titin I27 domains used in single molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) experiments. (B) SDS-PAGE after Coomassie Blue staining of ~2 μg of the polyprotein shown in (A). (C) Representative force curve of the mechanical unfolding of the polyprotein by SMFS. The dotted line is a worm-like-chain (WLC) fit to the force-extension curve with free contour length LCand a fixed persistence length Lp= 0.36 nm. (D) Statistical distribution of the contour length of the first peak (LC= 186 ± 3 nm, n=18). The solid line represents a Gaussian fit of the histogram. Fig. 3. Addition of HA tags at the N-termini of the largest UNC-89 isoforms does not affect the normal M-line localization of UNC-89 in body wall muscle sarcomeres, but does moderately reduce the level of UNC-89 giant isoforms in whole animal extracts. (A) Total Laemmli-soluble proteins from wild type andunc-89(syb797)were separated on a 5% SDS-PAGE, transferred to membrane and reacted with antibody EU30, a well-established rabbit polyclonal antibody to UNC-89. On the right is shown Ponceau S staining of the blots before reaction with antibodies. Note the presence of HA tags inunc-89(syb797)but not in wild type, and a moderate reduction in the level of UNC-89 giant isoforms inunc-89(sy797)compared with wild type. The asterisk indicates the position of the UNC-89 giant isoforms. The thin upper-most band is likely to be some UNC-89 that could not enter the separating gel. The positions of size markers are shown on the left-hand side. (B) Co-immunostaining of parts of two body wall muscle cells inunc-89(syb797)with anti-HA and MH42, a well-established monoclonal that recognizes UNC-89. Note the co-localization of each antibody to the M-lines of these muscle sarcomeres (merged image). Scale bar, 10 μm. Fig. 4.

(C) Co-immunostaining of parts of several body wall muscle cells inunc-89(syb797 syb1257)with anti-HA and the anti-UNC-89 antibody MH42. Note the disorganization of M-lines in this mutant. Scale bar, 10 μm. Fig. 6.unc-89(syb797 syb1257)animals that express HA-UNC-89 isoforms with an in-frame deletion of the interkinase region have disorganized myofibrils. Each panel shows representative confocal images of several body wall muscle cells stained with antibodies to the indicated sarcomeric components or with rhodamine-phalloidin. Scale bar, 10 μm. We examined the organization of MHC A and UNC-89, proxies for the middle of A-bands, at higher resolution using structured illumination microscopy (SIM). InFig. 7 AandB, it is clear that the N-terminal HA tag on the large UNC-89 isoforms (insyb797) has no effect on the normal pattern of straight parallel A-bands. However, in-frame deletion of IK (insyb797syb1257), for both MHC A and UNC-89 immunostaining, it is evident that the A-bands are broken, and much of the parallel arrangement is missing. In addition, there appear to be extra, short A-bands (indicated by arrows inFig. 7) that lie in the spaces between otherwise nearly normal A-bands. By capturing optical sections with an interval of 0.2 μm, we noticed that these partial A-bands lie mostly close to the outer cell membrane of the muscle cells. From top to bottom ofFig. 7AandB, images are shown from close to the outer muscle cell membrane to deeper into the cell. Note that the partial A-bands lie near the outer muscle cell but do not extend as deeply as normal A-bands. Fig. 7.unc-89(syb797 syb1257)animals that express HA-UNC-89 isoforms with an in-frame deletion of the interkinase region show extra A-bands that are not full-depth. After immunostaining with antibodies to MHC A (A) or antibodies to UNC-89 (B) multiple optical slices with a 0.2 μm interval were obtained by structured illumination microscopy (SIM). Yellow and blue arrows point to examples of short extra A-bands that lie between normally located A-bands and reside close to the outer muscle cell membrane. In comparison,unc-89(syb797)that expresses HA-UNC-89 shows parallel, normally spaced and full-depth A-bands. Scale bar, 5 μm. Fig. 8. Whole worm locomotion and muscle force measurements of wild type and variousunc-89mutant alleles. InC. elegans, the pharynx is a neuromuscular pump required for bringing bacterial food into the worm and grinding it up before its entry into the intestine.unc-89(ad539)was first isolated in a screen for mutants that show defective feeding behavior, and found to be an allele ofunc-89by complementation testing and 3 factor mapping; by polarized light microscopy the pharyngeal muscle was shown to have reduced birefringence and abnormal arcs in the terminal or posterior bulb [35]. Based on this, and the similarity ofad539withsyb797, we examined the pharyngeal muscle structure of both these alleles, and additional alleles ofunc-89using polarized light microscopy (Fig. 9). As first noted by Waterston et al. [1], inunc-89(e1460), instead of the radially oriented filaments observed in the posterior bulb of wild type, this mutant has longitudinally oriented filaments at the periphery of the bulb (indicated by yellow arrow inFig. 9). In fact, all theunc-89mutants that we imaged show this defect except fortm752, which shows normal pharyngeal muscle organization. Remarkably,syb797, with the HA tag, shows the same defect. However,ad539shows not only the defect in the terminal bulb; it also shows a defect in the anterior bulb (blue arrows inFig. 9). The only otherunc-89allele that shows both bulbs affected issu75. Fig. 9. Polarized light images of the myofilament lattice in the pharynges of wild type and variousunc-89mutant alleles. Yellow arrows indicate mis-localized arc-like thick filaments at the periphery of the terminal bulb, and blue arrows indicate mis-localized arc-like thick filaments at the periphery of the anterior bulb. Note thatunc-89(tm752)shows pharyngeal muscle like wild type, whereas all the otherunc-89mutants show defective organization.unc-89(su75)andunc-89(ad539)are the only alleles that show defects in both the posterior and anterior bulbs. Scale bar, 50 μm. To understand the pharyngeal muscle defect further, we examined the expression of UNC-89 protein in the pharynges of wild type,syb797andad539. This was done by co-immunostaining worms with antibodies to UNC-89 and to the pharyngeal myosin heavy chain MHC C [36]. We have previously demonstrated that in wild type, UNC-89 is localized to the middle of thick filaments in pharyngeal muscle [4]. As shown inFig. 10, UNC-89 is localized to the middle of thick filaments throughout the pharynx. However, insyb797there is no detectable expression of UNC-89 in the posterior bulb. Inad539there is no observable expression of UNC-89 throughout the pharynx. Moreover, MHC C staining reveals that in bothsyb797andad539, there are abnormal accumulations of thick filaments at the periphery of the posterior bulb (indicated by yellow arrows inFig. 10), corresponding to the arcs observed by polarized light. The expression defects in the mutants seem to correspond with the defects in pharyngeal muscle organization and indicate that UNC-89 is required for normal organization of sarcomeres in pharyngeal muscle. Fig. 10.unc-89(syb797)andunc-89(ad539)have reduced levels of expression of UNC-89 in pharyngeal muscle. The indicated strains were immunostained with antibodies to UNC-89 and the pharyngeal-specific myosin heavy chain C (MHC C), and representative confocal images of the pharynx are shown. Note thatunc-89(syb797)shows reduced UNC-89 expression in the terminal bulb, whereasunc-89(ad539)shows reduced UNC-89 expression in both the terminal and anterior bulbs. Green arrowhead, anterior bulb; red arrowhead, posterior bulb; yellow arrow, arc-like thick filaments mis-placed at the periphery of the posterior bulb. Scale bar, 10 μm. In this study, we explored the biophysical properties andin vivofunction of an example of ~600 aa sequence that has similar features (low sequence complexity, lack of predicted domains and minimal levels of predicted secondary structure elements) and location between two protein kinase domains in the UNC-89/obscurin class of giant muscle proteins. In the case of UNC-89 IK, which was studied here, as shown inFig. 1B, JPred predicts only short stretches of α-helices, primarily in the C-terminal third of the IK, and the majority of the sequence is predicted to be random coil. By use of single molecule force spectroscopyin vitro(Fig. 2) we showed that this IK sequence, is likely to be a random coil since it acts like an entropic spring upon application of pulling force. The nature of the IK sequence (random coil) and its physical properties (entropic spring) is shared with the highly elastic spring elements (PEVK, N2B) of another giant muscle protein, titin [37]. In the case of titin, there is good evidence to suggest that these elements unwind when muscle sarcomeres are stretched beyond their relaxed state, store potential energy and then provide a passive restoring force to allow the sarcomeres to return to their resting (relaxed) lengths [38]. To explore the muscle function of the IK, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to create a worm strain,syb797syb1257, in which most of the IK of UNC-89 was deleted in-frame. This strain also has its giant UNC-89 isoforms N-terminally tagged with HA.syb797syb1257also seems to show reduced expression of the UNC-89 giant isoforms similar to that shown by the HA tagged strain,syb797(an example is shown inFig. 5B). However, in contrast tosyb797which shows normal body wall muscle sarcomere organization,syb797syb1257, shows highly disorganized body wall muscle sarcomeres. Therefore, the body wall muscle sarcomere defect insyb797syb1257is likely caused by the lack of the IK. Because whole animal locomotion (swimming, crawling) and force generation are diminished upon removal of the IK, we also have learned that the level of sarcomere organization found in this mutant is not sufficient for proper contractile activity. In contrast, the better level of sarcomere organization inunc-89(tm752)is sufficient to generate normal force but is not sufficient to generate normal swimming or crawling speeds. The affects ofunc–89mutations on expression of UNC–89 isoforms, body wall and pharyngeal muscle structure, locomotion, body wall muscle force and body diameter. Finally, it should be pointed out that theC. eleganspharynx is often considered analogous to the vertebrate heart, although the two organs are likely to result from convergent evolution between two muscular pumps tasked with similar roles [49]. Thus, in the future, cardiomyopathy-causing mutations in human obscurin might be studied inC. elegansby creating the analogous mutations inunc-89, and using these mutants for genetic suppressor and drug screens. Recombinant protein production A cDNA encoding a 571 amino acid portion of the interkinase region of UNC-89, IYDYLRIQ…ADIEKVTP (residues 6945—7515 in UNC-89b) was synthesized using E. coli optimal codons and cloned into pUC57 by GenScript USA,. Inc. (Piscataway, New Jersey). This plasmid was digested with SpeI and SacI, and the insert was cloned into “I27 plasmid shuffled codons (003)”, in order to express a fusion protein consisting of 6xHis-I27-I27-UNC-89 IK 571 aa—I27-I27. (I27 is the human titin Ig27 domain.) The resulting plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) and the fusion protein was expressed at 20° for 5 hours after induction with 750 mM Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The 6xHis tagged fusion protein was purified with Ni-NTA Agarose (Qiagen), as described in [13]. The buffer of the eluted protein was exchanged with PBS containing 10% glycerol. Single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) experiments Pulling experiments using SMFS were carried out on a home-built single-molecule Atomic Force Spectrometer as previously described in the literature [50,51]. In each experiment, we deposited 10 μL of the UNC-89 IK domain polyprotein solution (0.5 mg/mL) in PBS (pH 7.4) onto a Ni2+-NTA functionalized glass coverslip [52] covered by 50 μL of PBS. We allowed the protein to adsorb onto the substrate for 10 minutes before pulling. The spring constant of each individual cantilever (MLCT, Bruker AFM Probes, Camarillo, CA) was determined experimentally by measuring the cantilever power spectrum and using the equipartition theorem [53,54] at the beginning of each experiment. All measurements were done at a constant velocity of 500 nm/s in PBS solution at room temperature. A worm-like chain (WLC) model [55] with a variable persistence length was fit to the first I27 peak to measure the contour-length (Lc) of the IK domain in the force extension data [56]. The far UV CD spectra of the protein constructs were recorded on a Jasco J-815 Spectrometer. The protein concentration was 1 μM in 30 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.4, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1mM TCEP buffer. A 0.1 cm path length cuvette was used. Generation of CRISPR/Cas9 edited nematodes Strains PHX797 and PHX1257 were generated by SunyBiotech (http://www.sunybiotech.com) using CRISPR/Cas9 technology in the following ways. PHX797,unc-89(syb797), was created from wild type strain N2 to contain an HA tag at the N-terminus of the large UNC-89 isoforms, using sgRNAs with the following sequences: sg1: ccatcATGGCTAGTCGACGCCAAAAG, and sg2: cccaccttacccttaccatcATGG. PHX1257unc-89(syb797syb1257)was created from PHX797 to contain a 4,614 bp in-frame deletion of the interkinase region, using sgRNAs with the following sequences: Sg1:CCTGTAGCACCGGAAGGTCGACG, Sg2:CCACCACCGACTGTGGAATACGT, Sg3:AACAGCAATTGAGAGAATTAAGG and Sg4:CCACAAAGAAGAATGATGATGGA. Sanger sequencing was used to verify the sequence alterations of each strain (Supplemental Figures 3and4). Both strains were outcrossed 5 times to wild type to remove most of the possible off target effects of CRISPR/Cas9; PHX797 to GB312, and PHX1257 to GB313. We used the procedure of Hannak et al. [57] to prepare total protein lysates from wild type,unc-89(syb797)andunc-89(syb797syb1257)animals. Equal amounts of total protein from these strains were separated by a 5% separating and 3% stacking Laemmli SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane for 2 hours and reacted with anti-UNC-89 EU30 affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies [4] at 1:100 dilution, or with anti-HA antibodies (rabbit monoclonal antibody C29F4 from Cell Signaling Technology) at 1:100 dilution, followed by reaction with anti-mouse Ig-horseradish peroxidase, and ECL. For the EU30 antibody we used Pierce ECL Western Blotting Substrate (cat. no. 32106 from Thermo Scientific), but for the anti-HA antibody we needed the increased sensitivity of SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (cat. no. 34080, from Thermo Scientific). We found that using freshly prepared or freshly purchased acrylamide solutions (e.g. ProtoGel, cat. No. EC-890 from National Diagnostics) was absolutely essential to prevent horrible streaking of the protein bands. Super-resolution microscopy was performed with a Nikon N-SIM system in 3D structured illumination mode on an Eclipse Ti-E microscope equipped with a 100×/1.49 NA oil immersion objective, 488- and 561-nm solid-state lasers, and an EM-CCD camera (DU-897, Andor Technology). The color balances of the images were adjusted by using Adobe Photoshop (Adobe, San Jose, CA). A Z-series at 0.2 μm intervals was taken from the outer muscle cell membrane deeper into the muscle cell, as shown inFig. 7. Day 2 adults were harvested as above, except that all washing steps used M9 buffer containing 0.2 g/L gelatin. 5 μl of worm suspension was added to the center of a 6 cm unseeded NGM plate, and the excess liquid was removed. After 5 minutes for adaptation, worm crawling was recorded using the above-mentioned strategy for extraction of body bends per second (BBPS) from a total of 66–90 individual worms for each strain. The resulting values for each strain were compared to wild type and tested for statistical significance using a Student T-test. Measurement ofC. elegansmuscle force using NemaFlex Polarized light images were captured with a Zeiss Axioskop microscope equipped with 20X/0.40 Pol strain-free objective and an AxioCam MRm digital camera and software (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany).
