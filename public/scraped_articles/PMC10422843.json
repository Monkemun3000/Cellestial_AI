  "content": "Genomic characterization and radiation tolerance ofNaganishia kalamiisp. nov. andCystobasidium onofriisp. nov. from Mars 2020 mission assembly facilities Received 2023 Mar 20; Accepted 2023 Jun 20; Collection date 2023. Many fungal species, including yeasts, have been isolated and characterized from different extreme environments, such as the Antarctic continent (rocks, soil brines), Arctic ice-sheet and sea-ice, deep sea, deserts, etc. (Buzzini and Margesin2014; Segal-Kischinevzky et al.2022; Coleine et al.2022). Yeasts and yeast-like fungi isolated from Antarctic environments (proposed as resembling the surface and conditions of Mars and/or Icy Moons) were reported to successfully resist a wide spectrum of stressors which mimic conditions on other planetary bodies, including ionizing radiation, UV-flux irradiation, extremely low and high temperatures, desiccation, high salinity and acidic conditions (Onofri et al.2004,2020; Selbmann et al.2005; Pacelli et al.2017,2021; Buzzini et al.2018). Since National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Planetary Protection (PP) seeks to prevent anthropogenic microbial transport (forward contamination) to other planets (Cockell2005; Conley and Rummel2010), evaluation of hitchhiking extremophilic yeasts on spacecraft and associated components is necessary. A wide range of microbial taxa, including both bacterial and fungal species, have been detected in various NASA spacecraft assembly cleanrooms (La Duc et al.2012), but historically NASA and European Space Agency (ESA) PP policy has focused on monitoring and eradicating bacteria, specifically those producing endospores. However, the presence of fungi in these cleanrooms has also recently been assessed, since fungi are tolerant of a wide range of extreme conditions (Parker et al.2022; Blachowicz et al.2022; Chander et al.2022b). Characterization of fungi (including yeast) is important both for assessing the risk of forward contamination and updating appropriate cleaning and sterilization strategies (Benardini and Moissl-Eichinger2022). Therefore, newly discovered fungal (including yeasts) species in cleanrooms must be evaluated not only for their morphology, but also at the genomic level so that new countermeasures can be developed to eradicate them based on their biology and resilient properties (Chander et al.2022b). To date, only filamentous fungi have been described from cleanrooms (Parker et al.2022; Blachowicz et al.2022; Chander et al.2022b). In contrast to filamentous fungi, yeasts are microscopic and predominantly unicellular (Boekhout et al.2021). It has been shown that yeast and yeast-like fungi are capable of adapting to and colonizing various ecological niches due to their genetic and phenotypic plasticity and robustness (Ene et al.2015; Ribeiro et al.2022). Several important adaptations facilitate survival of yeast cells in harsh environments, including production of thick external polysaccharide capsules, forming biofilm, and UV protective compounds, melanin, carotenoids and mycosporines (Buzzini et al.2018). In this study, we describe for the first time two novel yeast species from NASA cleanrooms, which are oligotrophic extreme environments. To explore yeast diversity in various environments including NASA cleanrooms, understanding their phylogenetic diversity and ecology is necessary. Phylogenies based on 16S ribosomal RNA or average nucleotide identity (ANI) are most commonly used for prokaryote taxonomy, but fungal species are identified with nucleotide sequences of multiple conserved gene regions (Lücking et al.2021). To identify yeasts, both phenotypic traits and molecular analyses are required (Boekhout et al.2021). The modern yeast taxonomy includes genealogical approaches based on single locus (ITS or LSU), multi-locus sequence analysis (MLSA) and recently whole genome sequencing (WGS) (Libkind et al.2020; Boekhout et al.2021; Chander et al.2022b). Molecular phylogeny for species recognition in Fungi is gaining broad attention (Lücking et al.2021), but understanding species ecology requires investigating morphology, physiology, and biochemistry leading to the Consolidated Species Concept based on the so-called polyphasic approach (Boekhout et al.2021). One of the objectives of this study was to characterize two novel yeast species by employing the polyphasic taxonomic approach, which is necessary to formally describe the two novel taxa. Colony morphology, microscopic features, and physiological properties were combined with MLSA phylogeny (seven loci). In addition, a phylogenetic analysis based on available WGS was applied to test its utility for species discrimination. The assembled and characterized genomes ofNaganishia kalamiiFJI-L2-BK-P3TandCystobasidium onofriiFKI-L6-BK-PAB1Twere compared with genomes of other closely related species to identify unique and shared evolutionary characters. Considering unique properties of the habitat challenging the microbial life, the third objective of this study was to assess the UV-C resistance of the two novel yeast species and compared with a UV-C resistant extremophilic yeast,Naganishia onofriistrain DBVPG 5303 from Miage glacier (Mont Blanc, Alps, Italy) at the altitude of 3892 m above sea level (Turchetti et al.2015). Sample collection and isolation of yeasts Steps for sample collection and isolation of yeasts at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Spacecraft Assembly Facility (JPL-SAF) and the Kennedy Space Center Payload Hazardous and Servicing Facility (KSC-PHSF) cleanrooms were previously described (Parker et al.2022; Blachowicz et al.2022). Briefly, samples were collected from cleanroom surfaces using moist polyester wipes and were agitated in 200 mL sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and shaken for 1 min. The resulting PBS suspension was concentrated using an Innova Prep LLC concentrating pipette and spread onto plates containing potato dextrose agar (PDA, Difco, #213,400) mixed with chloramphenicol (25 µg/mL). Plates were incubated at 25 °C for 7–14 days, and yeast strains were isolated, purified, and stored for further characterization. Steps for determination of microscopic traits and observation and microscopic morphology were followed as per previous protocol (Chander et al.2022b). In a nutshell, a small block of agar was placed in the center of a sterile slide, and all four sides of the agar were inoculated with the yeast suspension. Subsequently, a sterile cover slip was gently placed on top of the agar block. The slide culture was kept in a moist Petri dish lined with filter paper soaked in sterile water. After 14–21 days, the yeast grew out onto the coverslip and the slide was tested. The cover slip was gently removed with sterile forceps and placed on a clean microscopic slide with a drop of water or lactophenol cotton blue (Hardy Diagnostics, Santa Maria, CA) for microscopic observations. Phase contrast images were captured on an Olympus BX53 microscope with an Olympus DP25 camera and Olympus cellSens software. Differential interference contrast (DIC) images were generated on a Nikon Ti2-E inverted microscope with Nikon NIS Elements software. Cell morphological characters were measured with the Olympus cellSens or Nikon NIS Elements software. Preliminary identification based on ITS sequencing DNA was extracted from 7-day grown yeast cultures on PDA incubated at 25 °C using the tissue LEV purification kit with Maxwell-16 MDx automated system (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The ITS region was amplified employing polymerase chain reaction (PCR), using primers ITS 1F (5′-CTT GGT CAT TTA GAG GAA GTA A-3′) (Lai et al.2007),and Tw13 (5′-GGT CCG TGT TTC AAG ACG-3′) (Taylor and Bruns1999). PCR conditions and sample preparation steps for sequencing are described elsewhere (Blachowicz et al.2017).The ITS sequences were also included in the subsequent MLSA-based analyses. Genomic DNA was isolated from 1 g wet biomass scraped from PDA plates, using a ZymoBIOMICS MagBead DNA kit (Zymo Research) and bead beating, followed by a Precellys homogenizer (Bertin) treatment. The quality of genomic DNA was verified by gel electrophoresis and quantified by spectrophotometric measurements (Nanophotometer NP80 Mobile, Implen GmbH). Library preparation was performed using the Illumina Nextera Flex Protocol (Illumina document # 1000000025416 v07). The initial amount of DNA for library preparation was quantified, and 5–12 cycles of PCR amplification were carried out to normalize the output depending on the input DNA concentration. The amplified genomic DNA fragments were indexed and pooled in a 384-plex configuration with dual-index adapters. WGS was performed on a NovaSeq 6000 S4 flowcell PE 2 × 150 base pairs (bp) platform with a paired-end module. The data was filtered with NGS QC Toolkit v2.3 (Patel and Jain2012),for high-quality (HQ) vector and adaptor-free reads for genome assembly (cutoff read length for HQ, 80%; cutoff quality score, 20). The genomes for the two novel yeast species were reassembled using the Automatic Assembly For The Fungi (AAFTF v 0.3.3) pipeline (Stajich and Palmer2019), as follows: (i)The Illumina sequencing reads underwent trimming via the BBDuk module within the BBMap software suite (v 38.95)(BBMap: A Fast, Accurate, Splice-Aware Aligner (Conference) OSTI.GOV); (ii) BBMap was employed to eliminate any contaminant reads, and (iii) the resulting high-quality reads were assembled using SPAdes v3.15.4 (Bankevich et al.2012). (iv) Contaminant contigs were identified and removed, using nucleotide Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLASTn) (Johnson et al.2008); (v) We purged duplicated contigs using minimap2 (Li2018). Final assemblies were polished, using the Pilon v1.24 software (Walker et al.2014); (vii) The final scaffolds were sorted by length and the fasta headers renamed for further annotation. The assembly quality was verified with QUAST 5.1.0 (Gurevich et al.2013) and completeness using BUSCO and its basidiomycota_odb10 database (Seppey et al.2019). Genome annotation and comparative genomic analyses As described in Chander et al. (2022b), the funannotate v1.8 pipeline (Palmer and Stajich2020) for fungal genome annotation was used. Masked repetitive DNA content were identified using TANTAN (Frith2011) using the funannotate mask command. The funnanotate predict command was used for gene content prediction, via both evidence-based and ab initio (i.e. structure-based) prediction pathways. The basidiomycota_odb10 BUSCO database (Simão et al.2015) was used to find conserved gene models for training the ab initio predictors Augustus (Seppey et al.2019), glimmerhmm (Delcher1999), and snap (Korf2004). The GeneMark-ES was also evoked with the option for fungal genomes (Lomsadze2005). Weighted consensus gene structure was obtained via EVidenceModeler (Haas et al.2008) using weigh = 2 in the case of Augustus HiQ models and weight = 1 otherwise. Genes of length < 50aa and genes identified as transposable elements were filtered out of the dataset. tRNAscan-SE was used to predict tRNAs (Chan and Lowe2019). Finally, the funannotate annotate function was used to annotate genes using Eggnog (Huerta-Cepas et al.2019), Pfam (Mistry et al.2021), carbohydrate-degrading enzymes (CAZYme) (Drula et al.2022), Interproscan (Blum et al.2021), Gene Ontology (GO) terms (Gene Ontology Consortium2004), MEROPS (Rawlings et al.2018), and Secreted proteins (Choi et al.2010). Biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) were predicted in the two yeast genomes via fungiSMASH, the fungal-genome-specific version of antiSMASH (Blin et al.2021). We next run the funannotate compare function in 7Naganishiaspecies (which ones) and in 5Cystobasidium(which ones), to look for genomic trends of the above protein categories in those two groups of fungi. Next, we ran CAFE5 to infer changes in the size of Interpro gene families regarding their phylogenetic distribution using the gene birth and death procedure to infer gene gain and loss of specific yeast phenotypes. Assembled genomes and its respectively annotations were deposited at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI; Chander et al.2022a).

Genomic characteristics ofN. kalamiiFJI-L2-BK-P3Tand comparative genomic analysis Comparative genomic analyses.aPhylogenetic tree showing gain and loss of Interpro domains ofNaganishia kalamiiand otherNaganishiaspecies.b–cBar plot showing CAZYme group and family domains among theNaganishiaspecies.d–eUpSet plot showing the distribution (shared and unique) of the CAZYme family terms among theNaganishiaspecies and the relative table Detailed analysis into CAZy database revealed 49 genes associated with assembly (GT: glycosyltransferase) and 109 (84 GH: glycoside hydrolase, 3 PL: polysaccharide lyase, 22 CE: carbohydrate esterase) involved in the breakdown of carbohydrate complexes (Fig.3). In addition, 16 genes coding for initial lignin degradation (AA: auxiliary activities) and 5 involved in carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) were also predicted. According to genome-wide comparison,N. kalamiishared 59 CAZy families with otherNaganishiaspecies analyzed. No unique CAZy families have been recorded forN. kalamii. However, the polysaccharide lyase family 36 (PL36) was shared only among the members of theN. albidaclade. GH5 and CE10 were the largest family (both with 15 predicted genes inN. kalamii) shared also by the otherNaganishiamembers. GH5 consisted of genes related to cellulolytic activity while genes encoding CE10 family members act on non-carbohydrate substrates. Genes involved in the degradation of endogenous fungal cell wall polysaccharides (GH128) and lignin (AA1) were also detected. The Interpro analysis filtered for UV resistance terms forN. kalamiishowed the absence of protein directly involved in the synthesis of carotenoids (IPR004294).N. kalamiialso lack the UV radiation resistance protein (IPR018791), short coiled – coil protein (IPR019357), and the XPG conserved site (IPR019974) involved in the catalytic mechanism of DNA excision repair, but XPG, N-terminal (IPR006085) and XPG/Rad2 endonuclease (IPR006084) are present, both not conserved residues. The only strain exhibiting all the terms involved in the UV resistance was AntarcticN. vishniaciiANT03-052 strain. CAFE5 analysis revealed thatN. kalamiihas experienced an expansion of 10 Interpro domain categories while a reduction of 43 Interpro domains (p< 0.05) was witnessed (Fig.3a). The GO term conversion of the acquired Interpro domains are related to protein N-linked glycosylation and inositol phosphate dephosphorylation biological processes. In contrary, the contracted GO terms are related to regulation of DNA-templated transcription, regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II, protein folding, proteolysis, ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process, intracellular protein transport and vesicle-mediated transport. This suggested thatN. kalamiihave lost domains related to the control of transcription as well as protein degradation, folding and transport. Six biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) were predicted in the genome ofN. kalamiiFJI-L2-BK-P3T, five of which do not match with any known BGCs. These included three non-ribosomal peptide synthase-like (NRPS-like) clusters, one cluster encoding for a Type III polyketide synthase, and two clusters encoding for terpene synthesis, one of which was identified as the BGC for the synthesis of clavaric acid. Similar sets of BGCs were predicted for the genomes ofNaganishiasp. strain N6 andN. albidaJCM 2334, with two differences: one, neither of the terpene synthesis clusters were a match for clavaric acid in the genome ofN. albidaJCM 2334; and two,Naganishiasp. strain N6 was predicted to have a NRPS cluster in place of one of the three NRPS-like clusters (Fig.4). Genomic characteristics ofC. onofriiFKI-L6-BK-PAB1Tand comparative genomic analysis The estimated genome size ofC. onofriiFKI-L6-BK-PAB1Tis 20.99 Mb and assembled into 162 scaffolds (N50 = 616,502, L50 = 10) with a largest scaffold as 3,147,288 bp. The GC content is 48.8% and the raw sequences were submitted with an Accession#:JAKLNA000000000. The final annotation of theC. onofriiyielded a total of 6889 genes, divided into 6831 mRNAs and 58 tRNAs. The genome annotation revealed 2934 GO and 5820 Eggnog terms, 3930 Interpro and 4803 Pfam domains, 172 CAZYmes, 221 MEROPS peptidases, 335 secreted proteins, and 1540 BUSCO orthologs. Comparative genomic analyses.aPhylogenetic tree showing gain and loss of Interpro domains ofCystobasidium onofriiand otherCystobasidiumspecies.b–cBar plot showing CAZYme group and family domains among theCystobasidiumspecies.d–eUpSet plot showing the distribution (shared and unique) of the CAZYme family terms among theCystobasidiumspecies and the relative table Data from CAFE analysis ofCystobasidiumspecies showed thatC. onofriihas experienced an expansion of 31 Interpro domain categories while a reduction of 9 Interpro domains (p< 0.05) (Fig.6a). The expansions were related to acetyl-CoA biosynthetic process from pyruvate, DNA repair, regulation of DNA-templated transcription, protein phosphorylation, nitrogen compound metabolic process, mono-atomic ion transport, phospholipid biosynthetic process, iron ion transmembrane transport, and positive regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II. In contrary, the contracted GO terms were related to DNA repair, sulfate transport, and transmembrane transport. A single BGC, an NRPS-like cluster of unknown function, was predicted in the genome ofC. onofriiFKI-L6-BK-PAB1T. The genomes of neighboring speciesC. tubakiiJCM 31526TandC. pallidumJCM 3780Talso contained a single NRPS-like cluster, with an additional unknown cluster encoding for terpene synthesis predicted for the genome ofC. pallidumJCM 3780T.The genome ofC. benthicumwas not available for comparison. Resistance to UV irradiation of the novel yeasts Survivability of various yeasts exposed to UV-C radiation (doses: 0, 500, 1000, 2000 and 3000 J/m2. UV-C survival rates calculated using formula: N/N0, where N is the number of cells surviving at any given dose and N0the number of cells of original seed culture (~ 2 × 104cells/ml). The ratio of survival rates from three different species are plotted. The gray box shows the effect of desiccation and PVA treatment. The experiments were repeated twice Microorganisms associated with NASA spacecraft assembly cleanrooms might hitchhike on spacecraft surfaces, contaminate extraterrestrial environments, or compromise the life-detection missions. Due to stringent maintenance and cleaning, SAFs can be considered as extreme environments since microorganisms found in these cleanrooms could withstand unfavorable conditions and survive low nutrient availability, desiccation, controlled temperature, etc. Indeed, bacteria and fungi isolated from these SAFs are poly-resistant and have been reported to withstand harsh and unfavorable conditions. Therefore, characterization of yeast species from NASA spacecraft assembly cleanrooms is essential. Naganishiastrains phylogenetically close toN. kalamiiare well-adapted to cold environments. Extreme conditions might have a selective pressure leading to an increase in mutation rates, allowing microbial species to adapt to extreme conditions (Turchetti et al.2015). Most of theNaganishiaspecies (N. vaughanmartiniae,N. onofrii,N. friedmannii,N. cerealis,N. randhawae,N. globosa, N. adeliensis,N. liquefaciensandN. albida) are able to grow at low temperatures (4 °C) but onlyN. kalamiiandN. qatarensiscan grow at 35 °C. All the psychrophilic or psychrotolerantNaganishiaspecies exhibit the presence of cold-adapted genes which might have allowed them to colonize cold environments such as Antarctica and the deep sea (Selbmann et al.2005,2013; Turchetti et al.2015; Fotedar et al.2018; Han et al.2020; Segal-Kischinevzky et al.2022).N. qatarensis,a halophilic yeast isolated from a warm hypersaline marine environment in Qatar, is reported to grow at 30–35 °C (Fotedar et al.2018). Growth ofN. qatarensisat lower temperature (~ 25 °C) has been reported but it took 8 weeks after incubation. Conversely,N. kalamiiis able to grow in a temperature range of 15–35 °C after 7 days, and growth was noticed within 14 days when incubated at 4–10 °C. Similar toNaganishiaspecies, theC. onofriiclade consists of three species that were also isolated from cold environments (Tsuji et al.2017; de Menezes et al.2019) and other members of the genusCystobasidium(n = 12 species) are among the most common cold-adapted species (Buzzini et al.2018). All members of the genusCystobasidium, includingC. onofrii, are psychrophilic or psychrotolerant, with optimum growth temperatures ranging from 15 to 20 °C. Cryosphere harbors abundant microbial diversity, e.g. Antarctica, Greenland, cold lakes in Argentina, and deep sea (Buzzini and Margesin2014). Cold-adapted yeast species are reported to survive while embedded in the ice layers of glaciers or in permafrost (Zucconi et al.2012; Turchetti et al.2013), finding micro-conditions that are isolated from the surrounding environments (Price2000). Low nutrient availability is another limiting factor typical of Antarctic ecosystems. The oligotrophic Antarctic yeastC. tubakii, which closely related toC. onofrii,does not require amino acids and vitamins for growth, and is also able to grow at − 3 °C (Tsuji2018). Since future space missions—for example, ESA JUpiter ICy moons Explorer and NASA Europa Clipper missions—are designed to explore the potential habitability of icy moons, the presence of cold-adapted yeasts should be monitored in the NASA cleanrooms. For future missions, monitoring psychrophiles, xerophiles and halophiles in SAFs is of particular interest because they may be capable of surviving inside or under the icy crust of Europa due to its extremely cold and saline environment (Marion et al.2003). For instance,C. lysiniphilumandC. slooffiaeare reported as halotolerant species (Mokhtarnejad et al.2016). Similarly,C. onofriishows moderately halophilic aptitude since it exhibits growth at 10% NaCl. In general, SAF surfaces are decontaminated with reagents and also kept dry. Our genomic analysis reveals that bothNaganishiaandCystobasidiumspecies have predicted proteins (Pfam and Interpro terms) associated with dehydration and desiccation stress-response. Halotolerance is another adaptation required for yeasts typically active in hyper-arid regions, and so the halophilic traits detected in the genomes of these species also likely contributes to their survival in the cleanroom environment (Buzzini and Margesin2014; Logan et al.2021; Yurkov et al.2022). As reported by Yurkov et al.2022, members of both generaNaganishiaandCystobasidium(N. albidaandC. minutum) were nearly the only yeasts isolated from hot and dry sandy soil of the Namib desert.N. albidais well-adapted to dry conditions due to a thick polysaccharides capsules, which might be responsible for its remarkable ability to survive in air-dried autoclaved loamy sand (Vishniac1985). Highly desiccation tolerance has also been reported inN. vishniacii,showing almost 100% survival after 27 days at a relative humidity of < 1% (Connell et al.2014). Another species of the genus,N. friedmanniitested for desiccation (along with stratospheric low pressure and temperature and UV exposure) during stratospheric balloon flights, recorded larger numbers of viable cells than bacterial spores. Presence of the genetic traits associated with desiccation and oligotrophy were present inN. kalamiiandC. onofrii, promoting their presence to the stringent conditions found in cleanrooms. Our genomic analysis revealed that along with genes related to desiccation tolerance, genes related to UV resistance are present in bothNaganishiaandCystobasidiummembers. However, the only strain exhibiting all gene ontology terms involved in UV resistance isN. vishniaciiANT03-052, firstly isolated from the McMurdo Dry Valleys (Antarctica), a terrestrial Mars analogue. We may assume that local physical–chemical parameters of the environment might be one of the evolutionary drivers that induce the stabilization of the genes required to survive in the extreme conditions (Aureli et al.2023). The serine proteases ofN. kalamiialso include some hydrolases which were reported to degrade lipids (Leger et al.1997; Muszewska et al.2017). Protein tyrosine and serine/threonine kinase (PF07714), WD domain, G-beta repeat (PF00400), Ras family (PF00071), Cytochrome P450 (PF00067), Ankyrin repeats (PF12796) and ABC transporter (PF00005) are the most abundant Pfam terms in all theNaganishiaspecies and are usually associated with survival of multiple dessication-rehydration cycles (Gao et al.2017). Heat shock protein 70 and other Pfam terms for predicted proteins involved in the dehydration stress-response were also present in all theNaganishiaspecies analyzed. However, only the psychrophilicN. vishniaciiANT03-052 had genes involved in raffinose synthesis (PF05691). Raffinose accumulation is one of the adaptive strategies involved against cold shock (Imanishi et al.1998; Egert et al.2013; Yang et al.2022). By comparing the gene conservation and functional annotation in the different species analyzed, we identified that bothNaganishiaandCystobasidiumspecies present a consistent number of genes related to a saprotrophic lifestyle of decaying organic and plant materials (PL36; GH5; CE10; GH128; AA1). Moreover, serine proteases S33 and S09X found inN. kalamii,are essential hydrolytic enzymes with several functions such as protein maturation, signal peptide cleavage and transduction, and intracellular protein turnover. Although both are typically understudied in yeast, they have been suggested as a marker for saprotrophy in fungi as they are theorized to be less expressed in fungi with a pathogenic or animal-associated lifestyle (Muszewska et al.2017). Furthermore, it has also been suggested that the relatively high abundance of the aminopeptidases M01 and the serine proteases S12, which are both detected in abundance in the genome ofN. kalamii,may be an indicator of saprotrophy (Muszewska et al.2017). The same trend has been detected inC. onofrii.Furthermore, genes encoding a wide range of glycosyl hydrolases that have the capacity to degrade the major plant cell wall polymers (eg. AA1 for lignin and GH5 for cellulose breakdown) were found in bothN. kalamiiandC. onofrii. Acetyl esterases, found inC. onofrii,are an important component of the enzymatic machinery for fungal degradation of plant biomass and break down xylan-derived oligosaccharides and on galactoglucomannan (Venegas et al.2022). In particular, the Acetyl esterases subfamily members are preproenzymes, acting in the lysosomal/endosomal system and may be involved in the external digestion of proteins in saprophytic organisms (Chan et al.2014). The synthesis of extracellular enzymes which degrade organic matter and release nutrients is crucial for the survival of saprotrophs. However, by comparing the gene conservation and functional annotation of the two yeasts described here, we observed a loss in gene family (PFAM terms and GO-term counts) in both species, which is usually associated with a host/substrate shift from plants to animals. It is worth mentioning that the loss is more remarkable inN. kalamii(Muszewska et al.2017).
