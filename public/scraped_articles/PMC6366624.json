Antibodies are B cell proteins that play a vital role in adaptive immunity. These complex molecules, and their diverse specificities are defined at several levels. At the protein level, these molecules are heterodimers joined with disulfide bonds between heavy and light chains. At the genetic level, the antibody specificity is influenced by semi-randomly recombining a variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) gene segments that are encoded in the genome. This V-D-J, or in the case of the light chain, V-J rearrangement, also influences antibody specificity by random and semi-random base insertions or deletions during the recombination process. In the end, the collection of antibodies produced, the antibody repertoire, is a fingerprint of what antigens an organism has been exposed to and a measure of immunocompetence. Sequencing has become easier, cheaper, and faster in recent years. Antibody repertoires have been sequenced in numerous species, in response to vaccinations (1–3) and infections (4–6), and have been employed in cancer detection; providing valuable feedback regarding the immune system’s response to challenges and for early cancer detection in patients (7,8). In an effort to supplement unamplified MiSeq data sets used in our laboratory (9), we explored the use of commercial processes that use technologies to amplify sequences to increase the depth of coverage of specifically targeted immunoglobulin gene transcripts. These data sets are created using massively multiplexed PCR reactions that are subsequently sequenced on the Illumina platform. Multiplex amplification strategies have been used to explore the T cell (10,11) and B cell repertoires (12–15) and biases, omissions (10,11,16–18).and PCR artifacts have been detected in the data sets (10). RNA was prepared as outlined in Rettig et al 2017 (9). Briefly, RNA was extracted from the spleens of four nine-week old female C57Bl/6J mice. TRNA was submitted to the Kansas State University Integrated Genomics Facility for sequencing and cDNA was prepared using standard Illumina protocols. cDNA made from the TRNA using random hexamer primers and oligo-dT selection, was size selected to 275-800bp length and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq at 2×300bp using Illumina’s protocol. No additional amplification beyond that required by Illumina preparation was used and consider these samples non-specifically amplified, or “unamplified”. Commercial Sample preparations mRNA was extracted from the TRNA isolated from the sample used for the KSU data set using the PolyATtract mRNA isolation system (Promega, Fitchburg, WI) following manufacturer’s instructions. RT-PCR for samples amplified with Avian Myeloblastosis Virus (AMV) reverse transcriptase based sample preparation was performed using the Access RT-PCR System (Promega, Fitchburg, WI) following the manufacturer’s instructions. RT-PCR for Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus (MMLV) reverse transcriptase based sample preparation was performed using the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen, Carlsbrad, CA) following manufacturer’s instructions. Starting material for RT-PCR was either TRNA from the KSU data set or the purified mRNA. RT-PCR products were submitted to Adaptive Biotechnologies (Seattle, WA)(Com1)on dry ice following company protocols. TRNA and mRNA (unamplified) were submitted to iRepertoire, Inc. (Huntsville, AL)(Com2)on dry ice following company protocols. All statistical analyses were carried out using GraphPad Prism (Version 6.0). Paired T-tests were performed using the raw read counts. Coefficient of determinations (R2) were performed by comparing the percent of repertoire between animals. Percent of repertoire is determined by dividing the read count for a specific V-gene segment by the total number of reads detected and multiplying by 100. Most studies examining immunoglobulin repertoires use amplification to increase the depth of sequencing, but amplification comes with some drawbacks. We wanted to assess the comparability of amplified and non-amplified data from identical samples. In preparation to do this comparison, we found that different commercial amplification methodologies required different types of sample preparation. For example, sample submission for the Com1 data sets required a cDNA sample. The Com1 process amplified the resulting cDNA using proprietary primers and sequencing on the Illumina platform. After an initial submission showed a low correlation between the Com1 sequencing and the KSU data set (data not shown), we hypothesized that cDNA preparation plays a role in determining the amplified repertoire. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the role of starting material (mRNA or TRNA), reverse transcriptase (AMV vs MMLV), and primer templates (oligo-dT or random hexamer) on the sequenced B cell immunoglobulin repertoire. Com2 submissions required the submission of TRNA, rather than cDNA. Assessment of Transcriptional Read Counts Total number of productive reads per data set – Sequencing technique (Com1 and Com2 are amplified data sets) – starting material (mRNA – Messenger RNA, TRNA – Total RNA) – reverse transcriptase (AMV - Avian Myeloblastosis Virus, MMLV - Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus) – primer (dt – Oligo dT, Hex – Random hexamer) – an additional 27,896 reads were used for V-gene segment usage assessment. These sequences were not long enough for CDR3 detection. Determination of Sequencing Reproducibility To assess the repeatability of the amplified Com1 and Com2 data sets, we examined the correlation of V-gene segment usage. In the C57BL/6 mouse, the V-gene segment is the most varied in the heavy chain (IgH locus) comprising a total of 109 functional V-gene segments, three putative function V-gene segments, and alleles compared to 19 for the D-gene segment and four for the J-gene (21,22). The nucleotide sequences in the V-gene segments are also highly varied and require a complex multiplex PCR to amplify. Correlations were assessed using the data provided by the commercial vendor’s proprietary bioinformatics. Percent of non-C57BL/6 V-gene segments detected per data set – Sequencing technique (Com1 and Com2 are amplified data sets) – starting material (mRNA – Messenger RNA, TRNA – Total RNA) – reverse transcriptase (AMV - Avian Myeloblastosis Virus, MMLV - Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus) – primer (dt – Oligo dT, Hex – Random hexamer) R2 values of sequencing technical replicates. The percent of repertoire for each V-gene segment detected was compared between technical replicates. The highest R2 are dark read, the lowest R2 are blue. Impact of Amplification on V-gene Segment Detection Correlations of data sets to unamplified KSU data set and read counts – Sequencing technique (Com1 and Com2 are amplified data sets) – starting material (mRNA – Messenger RNA, TRNA – Total RNA) – reverse transcriptase (AMV - Avian Myeloblastosis Virus, MMLV - Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus) – primer (dt – Oligo dT, Hex – Random hexamer) Percent of repertoire for high frequency V-gene segments among data sets. Percent of repertoire for the KSU, Com1 (mRNA-MMLV-hex), Com2 (mRNA), and Prod (productive only sequences from the KSU data set) are displayed. The highest value percent of repertoire is dark read while the lowest are white. Black boxes represent no detected reads (true zero). Rounded zeros are represented as 0.0. Direct Comparisons of Amplified and Unamplified Data Sets When we reanalyzed the bioinformatics data from Com1 and Com2 using the KSU pipeline, we detected gene segments that were not detected in the original commercially provided bioinformatics. However, the inclusion of these gene segments, did not greatly improve the R2between the amplified data sets and the KSU RNASeq data. In the Com1 data set, some gene segments (V1-26, V1-18, V1-50, V2-9-1) were not detected or only detected at low levels in the original bioinformatics but were detected at high levels (>1%) in the KSU/IMGT processed data (Sup Fig 1). The three additional V-gene segments detected in the Com2 data set (V2-5, V1-62-2, and V1-62-3 were found in less than <0.3% of the repertoire (Sup Fig 1). These changes were not sufficient to significantly improve R2values. Impact of Amplification on the Reproducibility of CDR3 Detection Overlap of CDR3 sequence detection between technical replicates. CDR3 amino acid sequences were compared between technical replicates. Sequences unique to one data set are displayed in the outer circles. Sequences shared between data sets are in the overlap. Percent of shared CDR3 sequences is displayed in parentheses in the outer circles. (A) KSU data sets 32-1 and 32-2. (B) KSU data sets 39-1 and 39-2. (C) Com1 data sets mRNA-MMLV-Hex and mRNA-MMLV-dT. (D) Com2 data sets mRNA and TRNA. CDR3 sequence capture among Com1, Com2, and KSU data sets. CDR3 amino acid sequences were compared among the Com1 mRNA-MMLV-Hex, Com2 mRNA, and the KSU data sets. Percent of the repertoire shared with at least one other data set is listed in parentheses. Detection of High Frequency CDR3s High frequency CDR3s detected among the Com1, Com2, and KSU data sets. The top 25 CDR3s from each data set (48 total) were compiled and percent of repertoire compared. Black boxes represent no detected reads (true zero). Rounded zeros are represented as 0.0. Illumina sequencing of total RNA from mouse spleen is able to capture a representative sample of the splenic B cell repertoire. This snapshot of the repertoire, while producing less reads than amplified data sets, detected more V-gene segments than data sets that used two different amplification strategies and captures 98% of the high frequency CDR3s found in the amplified data sets. While amplified data sets provide more CDR3 depth of coverage, the unamplified data sets produced from an RNASeq allow for further data mining, eliminate as much primer bias as possible and provides an accurate representation of the repertoire. Sequencing requirements of the B cell receptor are more challenging than those of the T cell receptor. There are no consensus sequences to reference (10). Additionally, transcripts from the germline which are not successfully rearranged can be detected (23). Therefore, avoiding bias is one of the main priorities for antibody repertoire sequencing (16). PCR errors are accumulated through the amplification process which can falsely inflate the repertoire or they can add suspected mutations that do not exist (10,17,24,25) and they may not be distinguishable from low level mutations that actually do exist in the repertoire (24,26). PCR biases can be introduced because of primer binding properties, CG content, mispriming, non-specific binding, and errors during replication (16,27–29). A specific issue in targeting antibody gene segments is primer annealing efficiencies since the gene segments that make up the murine IgH locus are similar, though not identical (28). The biases inherent in the multiplex PCR can lead to false repertoire skewing, gene frequency inaccuracies, and a less comprehensive view of the repertoire (25,30,31). The development of these multiplex primers, is highly challenging (32). Work by Bashford-Rogers (33) shows that there is little difference between RNA-capture, 5’RACE or PCR amplification in humans but others (27) have shown that PCR does create biases and 5’ RACE helps reduce these. One analysis that was not pursued in this current investigation was the identification of clonally related sequences. We were specifically interested in the functional antibody repertoire present in the spleen and focused our analysis at the transcript level. We acknowledge that the overrepresentation of some sequences may be likely within our data sets since we don’t use barcoding or clonality analysis to collapse similar mRNA sequences. Nevertheless, the overrepresentation of a specific sequence by an overly productive cell is also representative of cellular activation of transcription, and likely, functional antibody protein in the body (47,48). Although there are issues using massively multiplexed PCR reactions, there are advantages that may overshadow the disadvantages. For example, increased sequencing depth (e.g.1,260,000 readsvs. 11,200 complete reads), better low frequency CDR3 detection (20-fold more unique CDR3 sequence than the unamplified KSU data set), and sequencing costs can be lower than an Illumina MiSeq run (by integrating multiplexing/barcoding). When preparing for antibody repertoire sequencing, multiple factors must be considered within the framework of the specific biological questions being asked. This includes needed coverage, cost, and starting material (39). Additionally, it is important to consider that all repertoire sequencing is merely a snapshot of a constantly shifting image (25). We will also never be able to fully capture the full diversity of the B cell immunoglobulin repertoire, which is estimated to range from 106-107possible unique rearrangements and mutations (25,39) to as much as 1013(15). The failure of the KSU data set to detect rare clones compared to the amplified data sets is likely due to this; but even the amplified data sets only sampled a fraction of the total repertoire. Therefore, one must decide how “deep” is adequate for the question being addressed. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that sequencing of unamplified splenic RNA provides a realistic snapshot of the total splenic B cell repertoire. We also have demonstrated that a good understanding of the bioinformatics work flow and reporting of the methodology is critical and cannot be understated. We understand that there are cellular biases and transcript stability differences with in B cell subpopulations (50,51). However, for the purpose of assessing a whole tissue B cell repertoire, unamplified RNASeq can provide a glimpse of the most prevalent B cell clones. The unamplified approach could just as well be applied to specific cell populations when the application requires it. Moreover, an unamplified data set may detect V-gene segments that amplified data sets miss.
