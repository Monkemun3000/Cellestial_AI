  "content": "A novel blue-light phototropic response is revealed in roots ofArabidopsis thalianain microgravity Main conclusionBlue-light positive phototropism in roots is masked by gravity and revealed in conditions of microgravity. In addition, the magnitude of red-light positive phototropic curvature is correlated to the magnitude of gravity. Due to their sessile nature, plants utilize environmental cues to grow and respond to their surroundings. Two of these cues, light and gravity, play a substantial role in plant orientation and directed growth movements (tropisms). However, very little is currently known about the interaction between light- (phototropic) and gravity (gravitropic)-mediated growth responses. Utilizing the European Modular Cultivation System on board the International Space Station, we investigated the interaction between phototropic and gravitropic responses in threeArabidopsis thalianagenotypes, Landsberg wild type, as well as mutants of phytochrome A and phytochrome B. Onboard centrifuges were used to create a fractional gravity gradient ranging from reduced gravity up to 1g. A novel positive blue-light phototropic response of roots was observed during conditions of microgravity, and this response was attenuated at 0.1g. In addition, a red-light pretreatment of plants enhanced the magnitude of positive phototropic curvature of roots in response to blue illumination. In addition, a positive phototropic response of roots was observed when exposed to red light, and a decrease in response was gradual and correlated with the increase in gravity. The positive red-light phototropic curvature of hypocotyls when exposed to red light was also confirmed. Both red-light and blue-light phototropic responses were also shown to be affected by directional light intensity. To our knowledge, this is the first characterization of a positive blue-light phototropic response inArabidopsisroots, as well as the first description of the relationship between these phototropic responses in fractional or reduced gravities. Plants utilize both gravity and light cues to direct plant growth and development. In addition to directing root growth towards the gravity vector, sunlight can penetrate the soil up to several millimeters beneath the soil surface, having a direct effect on the growth and development of roots (Woolley and Stoller 1978;Tester and Morris 1987). The red and far-red part of the light spectrum can penetrate to greater depths than blue light (Mandoli and Briggs 1984) which has led to plants evolving blue-light receptors located near the upper portion of roots and red-light receptors near the apices due to this pattern of light penetration (Mo et al. 2015). In addition, it has been shown that plants utilize blue-light cues to control root architectural features, such as lateral root growth (Moni et al. 2015). Light perception by the roots may also impact plant growth and development elsewhere, as light signals sensed by root apices have also been shown to have an effect on shoot gravitropic response (Hopkins and Kiss 2012). Taken together, these observations suggest that light perception within the root plays a dynamic role in plant development. Specifically, an effect of light irradiation on shortening the root length has been reported (Silva-Navas et al. 2015), although other works have shown higher rates of root elongation under light-grown conditions (Laxmi et al. 2008). Modulation of cell-cycle progression by photoreceptors in meristems is well known, but there are data indicating that this action of light is different in the root and in the shoot meristems (López-Juez et al. 2008;Silva-Navas et al. 2015). To perceive light stimuli, plants contain specialized photoreceptor proteins specific to red, blue, and UV-B light. Plants sense blue light via two types of light receptors: cryptochromes and phototropins. Arabidopsis contains two phototropins, PHOT1 and PHOT2 (Christie et al. 1999), and two cryptochromes, CRY1 and CRY2 (Christie et al. 2014). In addition, red-light perception is carried out by phytochromes, while UV-B perception is carried out by protein UVR8 (Brown and Jenkins 2008). In addition to regulating phototropic growth, phytochromes have been implicated in a multitude of biological processes, from seed germination to plant senescence. To date, five phytochromes have been identified inArabidopsis, and all have been linked to phototropistic response (Correll et al. 2003;Kiss et al. 2003;Lariguet and Fankhauser 2004;Kumar et al. 2008). The relationship between phototropism and gravitropism is a complex, poorly characterized interaction, where the direction of growth is an amalgamation of the two processes. To isolate phototropic response to a directional light source, the confounding gravity vector must first be removed. The utilization of facilities on board the International Space Station (ISS) provides the ability to conduct experiments in an environment of near-weightlessness, allowing for the study of “pure” phototropism, in the absence of a gravitropic response (Millar et al. 2010;Kiss et al. 2012). Specifically, using the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) in the Columbus module of the ISS provides the ability to study phototropic response to red or blue light in the absence of a unidirectional gravity vector. While plant growth and development in microgravity environments has been well characterized, considerably less is known about plant growth and development in fractional or reduced gravity environments (less than the nominal 1g;Kiss 2014). The EMCS contains a centrifuge which allows for the creation of gravity vectors to better characterize the interplay between gravitropism and phototropism. Our previous space experiments examined the phototropic response to red and blue light in microgravity, 0.1g, 0.3g,and 1genvironments (Kiss et al. 2012), providing insight on how plant growth and development may be effected on the Moon or Mars. Understanding how plants grow and develop in fractional gravity environment is an important step in successful habitation of the Moon or Mars. Furthermore, fractional gravity studies are helpful for the determination of thresholds of the gravity sensing and response of plants. In this study, we utilize micro-gravity as well as a continuum of fractional gravity (μ-g, 0.1g, 0.3g, 0.5g, 0.8g,and 1g) to better characterize the phototropic responses to red and blue light. In addition, we analyze the effects of a brief, red-light pretreatment on blue-light-based phototropism. Plant materials and the spaceflight experiment Threegenotypes of Arabidopsis thalianawere utilized for this study (Lehle Seeds, Round Rock, TX, USA): wild-type ecotypeLandsberg erecta(Ler), and the phytochrome mutant’sphyA-201andphyB-1(Kiss et al. 2003). Space-flight studies were conducted utilizing the EMCS on the ISS. The EMCS consists of two centrifuges with atmosphere regulation, including ethylene removal, as well as remote hydration control (Brinckmann and Schiller 2002;Brinckmann 2005;Kiss et al. 2014). The utilization of the onboard centrifuge provides an important control with the ability to separate microgravity effects from the other environmental conditions associated with spaceflight (Vandenbrink and Kiss 2016). The EMCS also contains a Sony FCB-IX470 video camera for image acquisition. This experiment was conducted in two parts, with the first set of seedlings being transferred to the ISS on SpaceX CRS-2 (March 2013) followed by return via CRS-3, and the second set being carried to the ISS on SpaceX CRS-4 (September 2014) and returned on CRS-5 (September 2015). Two sets of experimental runs were performed, the first set during ISS increments 35–36, and the second during ISS increment 41. Hardware utilized in this experiment has previously been described (Correll and Kiss 2005;Kiss et al. 2009). Briefly, each experimental container (EC) holds five individual seedling growth cassettes with an LED light source (white, red and blue;Fig. 1). Before flight, seeds were surface sterilized in ethanol and air dried under a laminar flow. The seedling growth media contain 50 % (w/v) Murashige and Skoog salts with 1-mM Mes buffer (pH 5.5). Whatman # 17filter paper was soaked in media and allowed to dry.Seeds were attached to a black gridded nitrocellulose membrane via 1 % (w/v) gum guar. Five seedling cassettes were placed into each EC and stored until launch (Fig. 1). Images of seedlings in cassettes in an EC during a spaceflight experiment run in the EMCS.

Thevertical numbersindicate GMT, Greenwich mean time.White arrowslabeledgandLrepresent the direction of gravity and light vectors, respectively Procedures during the spaceflight experiment Timeline of operations for the seedling growth experiments Growth and curvature of seedlings were measured using the program ImageJ (v.1.50e). Curvature was measured as change in degrees from starting position (defined as 0°). Angles were measured at the initiation of directional red or blue light and subsequently every 30 min for a total of 48.5 h. The number of samples measured for growth and angle per treatment ranged from 6 to 50 and are indicated inTables S1andS2. Positive curvature values were defined as growth in the direction of stimulus, and negative curvature was defined as growth away from the stimulus. Analysis of growth and curvature for each genotype was conducted utilizing linear regression of growth rate using the program R 64-bit (version 3.1.3). Regression coefficients compared via one-way ANOVA and subsequent Tukey’s honest significant difference test (P<0.05) were used to identify significant differences between plant growth rates. Data analyses were conducted via linear regression and subsequent ANOVA in R (3.1.3) using the car, multcomp, and agricolae packages. The multiple test correction was conducted using Tukey’s honest significance test (P<0.05). Multiple regression analysis was performed utilizing the following response variables: light-red, blue, or a 1 h red pretreatment before continuous blue illumination; genotype—Ler wild-type, or phytochrome mutantsphyAandphyB; gravity—a continuum ranging from 0g/microgravity to 1g; and seedling position—ranging 1–14, with 1 being closes to the source of illumination and 14 the furthest. The aim of this study was to investigate phototropism under a continuum of gravity conditions from microgravity, to partial (reduced) gravity, to 1g. Arabidopsisroots and shoots exhibit markedly different phototropic curvatures in different gravity conditions upon exposure to red or blue light. Initially, plants were grown for 96 h with unilateral white light and simulated 1gin an attempt to standardize the orientation of all seedlings (Fig. 2). During photostimulation, gravity levels of 0g, 0.1g, 0.3g, 0.5g, 0.8g,or 1gwere generated via centrifugation. Images taken prior to directional light photostimulation allowed assessment of seedling growth and development (Fig. 1). Seedlings with slow germination or improper development were excluded from analyses. The phototropic response in roots was measured as positive growth (towards photostimulation) or negative growth (away from photostimulation) from the initial vertical state. Multiple regression analysis of root phototropic response found significant effects from gravity (P<2.2 × 10−16), light quality (P<2.74 × 10−15), and position (P< 2.08 × 10−9). Genotype also had a significant effect on phototropic response in root (P= 0.02;Table S3). The phototropic response of roots grown in blue light demonstrates a novel, positive phototropic response under microgravity (Figs. 3,4). This response was attenuated at 0.1g, and is not present at higher gravity levels. In plants pretreated with red light for 1 h and subsequently exposed to blue light (Fig. 5), roots experience greater phototropic response (larger angles) when compared with blue-light exposure. Similar to blue-light root phototropism, the response is attenuated at 0.1gand not present in higher gravity levels. Finally, we observe a positive root phototropic curvature in roots exposed to red light (Figs. 1,6), and the positive phototropic curvature decreases steadily as the magnitude of gravity increases.

The positive phototropic response is attenuated by exposure to gravity Phototropic response in roots to blue light preceded by a 1-h red pretreatment in varying gravity conditions during the spaceflight experiment. The positive phototropic response to blue light is enhanced by the 1-h red pretreatment. The positive phototropic response is again attenuated by gravity Phototropic response in roots to unilateral red light in varying gravity conditions during the spaceflight experiment. The positive phototropic response to red light in roots exhibits an inverse relationship with magnitude of the gravity vector Similarly, multiple regression analysis was conducted for hypocotyls.Arabidopsishypocotyls displayed significant effects from light (P< 2.2 × 10−16), genotype (P<0.05) and position (P< 4.9 × 10−5). However, no significant effect was detected for gravity (P= 0.055;Table S4). Not surprisingly, on Earth, the phototropic response of hypocotyls to blue-light phototropism shows a robust response immediately upon stimulation, followed by cessation once the hypocotyl reaches ~90° (Fig. 7). This same trend is also exhibited in hypocotyls of plants initially pretreated with red light and subsequent illuminated with blue light (Fig. 8). There is no significant gravity effect on the phototropic response in red light pretreated or blue light illuminated hypocotyls. In hypocotyls of seedlings exposed to red light, we observe a positive phototropic curvature in plants exposed to red light (Figs. 1,9). Unlike hypocotyls of seedlings exposed to blue light, red-light exposure causes a steady positive phototropic response over time. However, similar to hypocotyls exposed to blue light, there is no significant effect of gravity on phototropic curvature. Phototropic response in shoots to unilateral blue light in varying gravity conditions during the spaceflight experiment. Positive phototropic response of shoots to blue light is not significantly affected by gravity Phototropic response in shoots to blue light preceded by a 1-hredpretreatment in varying gravity conditions during the spaceflight experiment. Positive phototropic response of shoots to blue light is not enhanced by 1-h red-light pretreatment Phototropic response in shoots to unilateral red light in varying gravity conditions during the spaceflight experiment Seedling position within the cassette also was shown to have a significant effect on phototropic curvature in both hypocotyls and roots. This is likely due to the variation in light intensity experienced within the seedling cassettes. Blue-light intensity decreases significantly the further the plant is from the light (Suppl. Fig. S1) ranging from 41.5 μmol m−2s−1at the position nearest the LED to 4.2 μmol m−2s−1at the position furthest from the LED. A similar trend is seen in red-light intensity, with illumination ranging from 59.6 μmol m−2s−1of light nearest the LED to 4.2 μmol m−2s−1furthest from the LED (Suppl. Fig. S2). Mean root growth (mm ± SE) of Ler,phyA,andphyBseedlings during photostimulation Different letters indicate statistically significant differences Mean shoot growth (mm ± SE) of Ler,phyA,andphyBseedlings during photostimulation Different letters indicate statistically significant differences Summary of the principal findings and technical issues in a series of spaceflight experiments performed in the EMCS on the ISS from 2006 to 2014 Continued technical improvements to space experiments on plant tropisms The large range in sample sizes (6–50) of the various conditions was a product of multiple factors. Due to limited space, the design of the experiment necessitated an unbalanced experimental design, where half as many plants were grown under blue light or were pretreated with red light. In addition, there was reduced germination during the second spaceflight experiment for the Ler WT and PhyA genotypes. The reduction in germination in likely due to the extended period of time the seeds remained in hardware prior to spaceflight, as germination counts during flight build were in excess of 85 % (data not shown). Reducing the time between hardware build and execution of the experiment can help to increase germination rates and to maximize scientific return of space-flight experiments. Phototropic responses in roots Comparison of the root phototropic responses to red light and blue light reveals unique patterns between the two treatments. Utilization of fractional or reduced gravity conditions allowed for the identification of gravity levels that correspond with an attenuation of response, which differed between the two light treatments. Interestingly, a threshold value of 0.1–0.3gis enough to cease phototropic curvature in roots illuminated with blue light; however, this same threshold is not observed in red light, which exhibits something akin to a gravity dose response. This difference in response suggests that the mechanisms controlling the interaction between gravitropic response and phototropic response are different for red and blue light. In addition, the enhancement of the blue-light phototropic response in roots after red-light pretreatment suggests that while the two responses differ in pattern and potentially, mechanisms, there is still an additive effect that causes an enhancement to total phototropic curvature. The notion of positive blue-light phototropism in roots tends to contradict the traditional understanding of phototropic function, where roots move in the opposite direction of blue light to grow deeper into soil. However, these observed differences in phototropism between 1gand μginArabidopsismay reflect the evolutionary history of plants. For instance, plants from older evolutionary lineages, such as mosses and ferns, have a very versatile directional response to both red and blue light (Kiss 1994;Wada 2007;Li and Mathews 2016). Thus, microgravity may reveal mechanisms of phototropism that are normally masked by Earth nominal gravity conditions. It is possible that the near-linear relationship between red-light phototropic response and gravity in roots is a result of cytosolic calcium ions which have been thought to play a key role in the transmission of gravity sensing (Poovaiah et al. 1987;Gilroy et al. 1993;Correll et al. 2013), potentially through regulating the distribution of auxin and auxin transporters within the root cells (Benjamins et al. 2003;Zhang et al. 2011;Shih et al. 2015). A study conducted byToyota et al. (2013)utilized parabolic flight to examine the effects of reduced gravity gradients on calcium (Ca2+) signaling. This study examined the gravitropic response to gravity vectors ranging from 0.5gto 2.0gand found intercellular Ca2+signaling exhibits a near-linear relationship with gravistimulation. This linear relationship between gravity sensing and Ca2+signaling is the inverse of the observed red-light-induced phototropic curvature in roots observed in our present study, suggesting a potential antagonistic relationship with the root red-light phototropic response mechanisms. A recent study also utilized parabolic flights to examine cytosolic calcium levels onArabidopsiscell cultures (Neef et al. 2015). In addition, this report demonstrated a clear link between several known Ca2+inhibitors/antagonists and changes in cytosolic calcium due to gravity. However, this study also identified a single Ca2+(nifedipine) inhibitor that had no effect on calcium signaling, suggesting the possibility of unique calcium channels or pumps involved in gravity signaling. It is possible that a gradual reduction in cytosolic calcium levels is responsible for the decreased positive phototropic response associated with increasing gravity. Phototropic responses in hypocotyls Red-light pretreatment of seedlings exposed to blue light did not result in an observable increase in the rate of positive phototropic response, and the pattern of phototropic curvature mirrored those seedlings that were not exposed to red-light pretreatment (Fig. 8). Interestingly, a recent study found that curvature enhancements stemming from red- or blue-light pretreatments were affected by light intensity, where higher fluence rates of the directional light caused a reduction in phototropic curvature (Sullivan et al. 2016). It is possible that enhancement of phototropic curvature was not observed in this case due to fluence rates that were high enough to inhibit the enhancement of curvature. In addition, it is possible that due to the rapid phototropic response of hypocotyls to blue light, we were unable to capture differences in curvature rate from the frequency of images we obtained (every 30 min). Increasing the rate of image capture (e.g., every 5 min) would likely help to identify enhancements in phototropic curvature of hypocotyls pretreated with red light. Phototropic responses and illumination intensity Multiple regression analyses of phototropic curvature in both roots and shoots revealed position as a significant variable that predicts the rate of phototropic curvature. This effect is due to the observed differences in illumination across the membrane as the distance from the light source increases (Suppl. Fig. S1andS2). Therefore, within a cassette where all seedlings are exposed to directional light for the same duration, seedlings furthest from the light source receive reduced fluency from the lights, and, in turn, exhibit reduced phototropic curvature. However, while the magnitude of curvature differed significantly across fluence rates, the overall proportional trend in curvature was conserved. The relationship between fluence rates and phototropic curvature is well characterized (Janoudi and Poff 1990;Sakai et al. 2001). Traditionally, illumination and curvature of hypocotyls follow the Bunsen-Roscoe law, where curvature is a product of illumination intensity and the duration of exposure (Bunsen and Roscoe 1863). However, the previous studies characterizing phototropic response have reported that this relationship ceases to be valid at illumination intensities of greater than 0.01 μmol m−2(Janoudi and Poff 1990), well below the light intensity used in this study. In addition, illumination intensity has previously been shown to have no effect on phototropic curvature of hypocotyls of WT seedlings (Sakai et al. 2001). It also is possible that the significant effect of position on phototropic curvature is the result of the use of non-etiolated seedlings, which our previous spaceflight studies utilized. In this study, we characterize a novel blue-light phototropism that is present in microgravity, but is attenuated at low (0.1–0.3g) gravity levels. One-hour red-light pre-treatment followed by blue-light illumination enhanced the rate of positive phototropic curvature in roots. In addition, positive phototropic curvature in roots exposed to red-light was observed; however, increasing levels of gravity causes a gradual reduction in the magnitude of curvature as opposed to the drastic cessation observed under blue-light exposure. The red-light phototropic response of hypocotyls in microgravity, which we have previously characterized, was also confirmed.
