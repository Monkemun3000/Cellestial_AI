In immunocompromised individuals,Aspergillus fumigatuscauses invasive fungal disease that is often difficult to treat. Exactly how immune mechanisms controlA.fumigatusin immunocompetent individuals remains unclear. Here, we use transparent zebrafish larvae to visualize and quantify neutrophil and macrophage behaviors in response to differentA.fumigatusstrains. We find that macrophages form dense clusters around spores, establishing a protective niche for fungal survival. Macrophages exert these protective effects by inhibiting fungal germination, thereby inhibiting subsequent neutrophil recruitment and neutrophil-mediated killing. Germination directly drives fungal clearance as faster-growing CEA10-derived strains are killed betterin vivothan slower-growing Af293-derived strains. Additionally, a CEA10pyrG-deficient strain with impaired germination is cleared less effectively by neutrophils. Host inflammatory activation through Myd88 is required for killing of a CEA10-derived strain but not sufficient for killing of an Af293-derived strain, further demonstrating the role of fungal-intrinsic differences in the ability of a host to clear an infection. Altogether, we describe a new role for macrophages in the persistence ofA.fumigatusand highlight the ability of differentA.fumigatusstrains to adopt diverse modes of virulence. Immunocompromised patients are susceptible to invasive fungal infections, including aspergillosis. However, healthy humans inhale spores of the fungusAspergillus fumigatusfrom the environment every day without becoming sick, and how the immune system clears this infection is still obscure. Additionally, there are many different strains ofA.fumigatus, and whether the pathogenesis of these different strains varies is also largely unknown. To investigate these questions, we infected larval zebrafish withA.fumigatusspores derived from two genetically diverse strains. Larval zebrafish allow for visualization of fungal growth and innate immune cell behavior in live, intact animals. We find that differences in the rate of growth between strains directly affect fungal persistence. In both wild-type and macrophage-deficient zebrafish larvae, a fast-germinating strain is actually cleared better than a slow-germinating strain. This fungal killing is driven primarily by neutrophils while macrophages promote fungal persistence by inhibiting spore germination. Our experiments underline different mechanisms of virulence that pathogens can utilize—rapid growth versus dormancy and persistence—and inform future strategies for fighting fungal infections in susceptible immunocompromised patients. Humans inhale hundreds ofAspergillus fumigatusspores from the environment every day and yet almost all immunocompetent individuals successfully contend with the fungal infection. Immunocompromised patients, however, especially acute leukemia patients, hematopoietic cell transplant recipients, and solid-organ transplant recipients, are at risk of developing invasive aspergillosis [1]. In invasive disease,Aspergillusspores germinate into filamentous hyphae and invade and destroy tissues and organs, with mortality rates as high as 50 to 60% in patient populations [1]. Limited antifungal treatments exist and there is growing resistance among fungi to these drugs [2]. The development of successful immunotherapy-based treatments to this infection requires a more comprehensive understanding of the interplay of immune mechanisms that controlAspergillus in vivo. In immunocompetent individuals, the innate immune system is generally sufficient forA.fumigatusclearance, with both macrophages and neutrophils playing major roles [3]. Macrophages primarily target and phagocytose conidia (spores), and can kill conidiain vitrowithin hours [4,5].In vivo, however, the requirement for and role of macrophages is unclear, with some studies reporting no effect on survival in macrophage-depleted mice [6] and others demonstrating an increased fungal burden in such mice [7]. Neutrophils, on the other hand, are consistently required in mice in response toAspergillus[6,8], and neutropenia is a key risk factor for patients in the development of invasive aspergillosis [9]. Neutrophils can kill conidiain vivo[10] and inhibit conidial germination bothin vitroandin vivo[11,12]. Immune cell populations can also influence the activity of other immune cell types, and CCR2+ inflammatory monocytes can increase neutrophil function in response toAspergillusthrough pro-inflammatory gene expression [13,14]. However, the full extent of macrophage/monocyte and neutrophil interactions throughout the course of infection, and their effect on fungal growth and clearance, are not known. Perhaps the most important step inAspergilluspathogenesis is germination, the developmental switch from resting, dormant conidia to filamentous, invasive growth [15]. These different fungal forms induce differential activation of immune cellsin vitroand recruitment of these cellsin vivo[16–18]. After invasive hyphae have developed, neutrophils can respond with a variety of killing mechanisms [11,19–21]. However, how this switch, and specifically earlier stages of fungal germination prior to the development of extensive invasive growth, affects immune activation, fungal clearance, and disease progressionin vivois largely unknown. Larval zebrafish provide an ideal model in which to study the early effects of fungal germination as well as the interplay between multiple immune cell types throughout infection. Larval zebrafish are transparent and can be non-invasively imaged and therefore allow for visualization of innate immune cell behavior and fungal development in a live, intact host throughout a multi-day infection. While murine models require enormous fungal inoculums (~107conidia) and host immunosuppression in order to directly visualize immune cell-pathogen encounters within the context of host tissue, the larval zebrafish allows for visualization of smaller doses (10–100 conidia) in wild-type hosts [22].Aspergillusinfection models in zebrafish have already been developed by our lab and others and recapitulate many aspects of human and mouse infection, including initial phagocytosis of conidia by macrophages and post-germination neutrophil recruitment [21,23]. These models have already provided new insight into the biology of immune responses toAspergillussuch as the observation of spore transfer between macrophages [24]. In this study, we have infected larval zebrafish withAspergillus fumigatusstrains derived from patient isolates Af293 and CEA10. Heterogeneity amongA.fumigatusisolates has been increasingly recognized [25], and Af293 and CEA10 in particular are known to be differentially virulent in specific mouse and zebrafish models [26–28]. The genomes of these strains differ by ~50,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which is an approximately average level of genetic diversity among sequencedA.fumigatusisolates [28]. Af293 and CEA10 strains also possess differences in growth [27], activation of the host immune response [27,29], response to hypoxia [26], secondary metabolism [30,31], and response to light [32]. We aimed to use these two different strains coupled with live imaging in larval zebrafish to identify and characterize differential neutrophil and macrophage behaviors in response toA.fumigatusinfection. We report that while CEA10 is generally regarded as more virulent than Af293 [26,27], CEA10-derived strains are killed better than Af293-derived strainsin vivo, even while CEA10-derived strains germinate faster. Host inflammatory activation, partially through Myd88, is required for clearance of a CEA10-derived strain, but strikingly, is not sufficient for clearance of an Af293-derived strain. Macrophages only marginally contribute to clearance of CEA10-derived strains. Instead, macrophages primarily provide a protective niche for spores, forming tight, dense clusters around the fungus, inhibiting spore germination. Our data demonstrate that germination actually drives fungal clearance through neutrophil-mediated killing.

See alsoS1 Fig. Myd88-mediated inflammatory activation is required for clearance of a CEA10-derived strain Compared to Af293, CEA10 differentially activates specific inflammatory pathways in mice [27], and we first hypothesized that the differential killing of CEA10 was due to greater inflammatory activation. We utilized anNF-κB RE:EGFPreporter line [33] to measure differences in NF-κB activation after infection with Af293- or CEA10-derived non-fluorescent strains in larval zebrafish. At 2 dpi, CEA10-infected larvae have significantly more GFP signal and therefore NF-κB activation than Af293-infected larvae at the infection site, indicating that NF-κB activation is correlated with fungal killing (Fig 2A and 2B).

NF-κB RE:EGFP larvae were infected with non-fluorescent TJW55.2 (Af293) or CEA17 KU80Δ (CEA10) spores and imaged 2 dpi.

See alsoS2 Fig. CEA10-induced inflammatory activation is not sufficient for killing of Af293 To specifically test whether the increased immune activation induced by this CEA10 infection is sufficient for fungal killing, we co-infected larvae with a red fluorescent Af293-derived strain and a green fluorescent CEA10-derived strain and performed CFU counts throughout a 5 day infection. As shown previously, in single infections this CEA10 strain is cleared over the course of infection while the Af293 strain persists (Figs1Dand3A). In a co-infection, this same pattern remained—Af293 was not significantly cleared, even in the presence of an immune-activating CEA10 strain (Fig 3A). Imaging experiments confirmed that these spores can be found in the same or neighboring cells (Figs3B, 3CandS3), suggesting that these killing differences are not due to local variation in immune activation, but instead to fungal-intrinsic phenotypes. Fig 3. CEA10-induced inflammatory activation is not sufficient for killing of an Af293-derived strain. A. Fungal burden was monitored by CFU platings from single homogenized larvae infected either singly with TFYL49.1 (CEA10) or TBK5.1 (Af293) or co-infected with both strains. Average injection CFUs: Af293 = 53, CEA10 = 47, co-infection = 21 Af293 + 27 CEA10.

Macrophage-membrane labeled larvae (mfap4:tomato-CAAX) were co-infected with YFP-expressing TBK1.1 (Af293) and AlexaFluor633-labeled CEA17 KU80Δ (CEA10) and imaged 1 dpi. Percentage of Af293 spores within 20 μm of a CEA10 spore in each larvae from two replicates was quantified (B). Each point represents one larvae, color-coded by replicate. Single z-slice images from a representative larvae (C) are shown. Scale bar represents 5 μm. See alsoS3 Fig. Macrophages form tight, persistent, and dynamic clusters aroundA.fumigatus To further determine the mechanism by which this CEA10 strain ofA.fumigatusis killed, we utilized the multi-day imaging capabilities of larval zebrafish to monitor the recruitment and behavior of macrophages and neutrophils in individual larvae over the course of a five day infection. By following individual larvae with both labeled macrophage nuclei (mpeg1:mcherry-H2B) and neutrophils (lyz:BFP) throughout a 5 day infection, we aimed to determine both differences in immune cell recruitment within larvae over time and population-level differences between larvae infected with a CEA10-derived strain versus an Af293-derived strain. On a population level, CEA10 infection recruited more macrophages and neutrophils than Af293 infection, throughout the entire time course (Fig 4A and 4B). These differences were significant as early as 2 dpi and up to 5 dpi (Fig 4A and 4B). However, the number of macrophages and neutrophils present at the site of infection was also dynamic, fluctuating from day to day in individual larvae (Fig 4A and 4B). In general, immune cell recruitment peaked at 2 dpi, decreasing slowly afterwards, coinciding with the timeline of fungal clearance (Fig 1D). Fig 4. Macrophages form tight clusters aroundA.fumigatus. A-D. Dual macrophage-nuclear (mpeg1:mcherry-H2B) and neutrophil (lyz:BFP) labeled larvae were infected with YFP- or GFP-expressingA.fumigatusTBK1.1 (Af293) or TFYL49.1 (CEA10) strains and imaged days 1–5 post injection. Macrophage (A) and neutrophil (B) recruitment as well as phagocyte cluster size (D) were quantified. Representative images (C, scale bar represents 20 μm) and pooled quantification from 3 experiments (A, B, D) are shown. Each line in graphs represents one larvae followed for the entire course of infection, lines are color-coded by replicate, bars represent pooled lsmeans ± SEM, P values calculated by ANOVA. Af293 n = 25, CEA10 n = 27 for macrophage and cluster area quantification; Af293 n = 17, CEA10 n = 18 for neutrophil quantification.E. Macrophage-membrane (mfap4:tomato-CAAX) labeled larvae were infected with CEA17 KU80Δ (CEA10) and imaged 3 dpi. Asterisks represent cell nuclei, arrows indicate cell-cell junctions. Scale bar represents 10 μm. See alsoS4 Fig. During this imaging, we were surprised to find that these recruited phagocytes form tight clusters around the injectedA.fumigatus, as early as 1 dpi, that persist throughout the five day infection (Figs4C, 4DandS4A,S1 Movie). These clusters were primarily made up of macrophages, but neutrophils also infiltrated, generally arriving after macrophages (Figs4CandS4A). These macrophages form tight associations, with their membranes directly opposed and without space between the cells (Fig 4E). Germination ofA.fumigatusspores inside the clusters could be found (S4A Fig). We also observed the apical extrusion of a cluster out of the hindbrain of two larvae, suggesting extrusion is a possible but rare mechanism for the host to eliminate the infection (S4B Fig). Quantification of phagocyte cluster size demonstrates that significantly larger clusters form in response to CEA10 compared to Af293, consistent with differences in observed numbers of phagocytes recruited (Fig 4C and 4D). Additionally, the size of these clusters is dynamic, changing in individual larvae throughout the course of infection, but also peaking at 2 dpi and decreasing in size as the infection is cleared (Fig 4C and 4D). A CEA10-derived strain is more virulent than an Af293-derived strain in a neutrophil-defective host Since macrophages are the predominant cell type infiltrating the site of infection and forming clusters around the fungus, we hypothesized that macrophages contribute to killing of CEA10-derived strains ofA.fumigatus. Macrophages and neutrophils are the predominant immune cell types present in zebrafish larvae at this stage of development [36] and therefore, to determine the ability of macrophages alone to killA.fumigatus in vivo, we performed fungal CFU counts after infection of a neutrophil-defective host (mpx:rac2D57N). These larvae express a dominant-negative copy of Rac2 under a neutrophil-specific promoter, preventing the migration of neutrophils out of the vasculature [37]. Consistent with previous observations (Fig 1), an Af293-derived strain was not significantly cleared in either neutrophil-defective or control hosts (Fig 5A). However, 2 dpi, neutrophil-defective larvae are able to decrease fungal burden of a CEA10-derived strain equivalently to the control, to ~60% of the initial dose (Fig 5A), indicating that early in infection macrophages have a low-level killing ability against CEA10. However, at 3 dpi, CFUs from these neutrophil-defective larvae increase, demonstrating that macrophages alone cannot contain the growth of CEA10 (Fig 5A). Because these larvae have fewer functional immune cells in total, we also tested a lower dose of CEA10, but found that the infectious dose did not have any effect on percent of fungal clearance (S5 Fig). Fig 5. A CEA10-derived strain is more virulent in a neutrophil-defective host. Neutrophil-defective (mpx:rac2D57N) or control (mpx:rac2WT) larvae were infected with TBK1.1 (Af293) or TFYL49.1 (CEA10).A. CFUs were monitored, average injection CFUs: Af293 = 36, CEA10 = 32.B. Larval survival was monitored, average injection CFUs: Af293 = 35, CEA10 = 27. For all analyses, data shown are from 3 pooled replicates. For CFU analysis, data represent lsmeans ± SEM, P values calculated by ANOVA. CFU data are from 24 larvae (3 replicates, 8 larvae each) per condition per day. For survival analysis, P values were calculated by Cox proportional hazard regression analysis. See alsoS5 Fig. Macrophages provide a protective niche for CEA10 Fig 6. A CEA10-derived strain is cleared more efficiently by macrophage-deficient hosts than wild-type hosts. A, B. Macrophage-deficient (irf8-/-) or control (irf8+/+) larvae were infected with TBK1.1 (Af293) or TFYL49.1 (CEA10) and CFUs (A) or larval survival (B) were monitored. For CFU experiments, average injection CFUs: Af293 = 23, CEA10 = 23. For survival experiments, average injection CFUs: Af293 = 44, CEA10 = 31.C, D. Macrophage-depleted (clodronate liposomes) or control (PBS liposomes) larvae were infected with TBK1.1 (Af293) or TFYL49.1 (CEA10) and CFUs (C) or larval survival (D) were monitored. Average injection CFUs: Af293 = 37, CEA10 = 40. For all analyses, data shown are from 3 pooled replicates. For CFU analyses, data represent lsmeans ± SEM, P values calculated by ANOVA. All CFU data are from 24 larvae (3 replicates, 8 larvae each) per condition per day. For survival analyses, P values were calculated by Cox proportional hazard regression analysis. See alsoS6 Fig. As a consequence of Irf8 deficiency, these larvae also develop a larger number of neutrophils [38]. However, larvae injected with clodronate liposomes also cleared a CEA10-derived strain, but not an Af293-derived strain, significantly better than control PBS liposome-injected larvae at 1 dpi (Fig 6C). As clodronate liposome injection specifically depletes macrophages without affecting neutrophils (S6A Fig), this result suggests that this increased early clearance is a specific consequence of macrophage depletion. Clodronate liposome-injected larvae do however succumb to infection (Figs6DandS6B), indicating either that a larger number of neutrophils is required for complete fungal clearance and host survival in the absence of macrophages, and/or that clodronate liposomes affect neutrophil function without altering neutrophil numbers. These data demonstrate that the presence of macrophages actually protects injected CEA10 spores, but not Af293 spores, from neutrophil-mediated killing at early time points after infection, and suggest that macrophages might provide a protective niche for survival of certain fungal strains. CEA10 recruits more neutrophils than Af293 in macrophage-deficient hosts To quantify neutrophil recruitment in the absence of macrophages, we performed sudan black staining 1 dpi in macrophage-deficientirf8-/-or control larvae (Fig 7A–7C). Strikingly, in ~50% of macrophage-deficient larvae infected with a CEA10-derived strain, we observed extensive neutrophil recruitment that resulted in a mass of sudan black staining (Fig 7A and 7B). These sudan black masses were also sometimes observed in macrophage-deficient larvae infected with an Af293-derived strain, but significantly less so, and were rarely observed in control infected larvae. We quantified the number of neutrophils recruited to the infection site, finding significantly more recruitment inirf8-/-larvae infected with an CEA10-derived strain compared to an Af293-derived strain (Fig 7C). These data indicate that in the absence of macrophages, high numbers of neutrophils are specifically recruited to CEA10 infections. Fig 7. More neutrophils are recruited to a CEA10-derived strain than an Af293-derived strain in the absence of macrophages. A-D. Macrophage-deficient (irf8-/-) or control (irf8+/+) larvae were infected with YFP- or GFP-expressingA.fumigatusTBK1.1 (Af293) or TFYL49.1 (CEA10) strains, fixed 1 dpi, and stained for neutrophils (sudan black). Representative images are shown (A, scale bar represents 50 μm) and percent of larvae per experiment with sudan black masses (B), number of neutrophils at infection site (C), and percent of larvae per experiment withA.fumigatushyphae (D) were quantified.

See alsoS8 Fig. Germination drives neutrophil-mediated fungal killing To investigate the role of germination in neutrophil recruitment, we injected heat-killed spores into macrophage-deficientirf8-/-larvae and quantified the presence of sudan black masses in the hindbrain that we observed previously (Fig 7A and 7B). We found that heat-killed spores do not recruit neutrophils, suggesting that spore germination and fungal growth is required for neutrophil recruitment (Fig 9A). Fig 9. Neutrophil-mediated killing requires germination. A. Macrophage-deficient (irf8-/-) or control (irf8+/+) larvae were injected with live or heat-killed TFYL49.1 (CEA10), fixed 1 dpi, and stained for neutrophils (sudan black). Larvae were then scored for the presence or absence of a sudan black cluster or mass. This experiment was performed twice, data are shown from one representative replicate.B. Wild-type or phagocyte-deficient (pu.1 morphant) larvae were infected with TBK1.1 (Af293pyrG+), Af293.1 (Af293pyrG-), TFYL49.1 (CEA10pyrG+), or CEA17 (CEA10pyrG-) spores and survival was monitored. Data represent 2 pooled experiments. Average injection CFUs: Af293pyrG+ = 52, Af293pyrG- = 52, CEA10pyrG+ = 38, CEA10pyrG- = 48.C. Wild-type larvae were infected with TBK1.1 (Af293pyrG+), Af293.1 (Af293pyrG-), TFYL49.1 (CEA10pyrG+), or CEA17 (CEA10pyrG-) and CFUs were monitored. Average injection CFUs: Af293pyrG+ = 45, Af293pyrG- = 48, CEA10pyrG+ = 42, CEA10pyrG- = 49.D. Macrophage-deficient (irf8-/-) larvae were infected with CEA17 KU80Δ (CEA10pyrG+), or CEA17 (CEA10pyrG-) and CFUs were monitored. Average injection CFUs: CEA10pyrG+ = 41, CEA10pyrG- = 45. All CFU data represent lsmeans ± SEM from 3 pooled replicates composed of 24 larvae (8 larvae per replicate) per condition per day. P values were calculated by ANOVA. See alsoS9 Fig. However, immune cell killing activity against heat-killed spores cannot be measured, therefore to investigate the role of germination in fungal clearance, we utilizedA.fumigatus pyrG-deficient strains, which are auxotrophic for uridine-uracil and are known to have impaired germination and attenuated virulence in mice [39]. To determine if these strains also have impaired germination in larval zebrafish we infected phagocyte-deficient larvae (pu.1morphant) and measured survival as well as germination. Indeed, germination of a CEA10-derivedpyrG-deficient strain is abrogated in larval zebrafish and both CEA10- and Af293-derivedpyrG-deficient strains cause minimal death in both wild-type and phagocyte-deficient larvae (Figs9BandS9). To determine the requirement for germination in neutrophil-mediated killing, we determined the effect ofpyrGdeficiency in the specific context of CEA10 killing inirf8-/-macrophage-deficient hosts (Fig 6A). In these larvae, neutrophils effectively clear ~85% of CEA10pyrG+ fungal burden by 1 dpi (Fig 9D). However, a CEA10pyrG- infection is cleared significantly less in this context. At 3 dpi, there is no difference inpyrG- fungal clearance betweenirf8-/-macrophage-deficient larvae and wild-type larvae. These data indicate thatpyrG-deficient CEA10 cannot be cleared by neutrophils, even in the absence of macrophages, suggesting that neutrophil-mediated clearance of CEA10 is dependent on germination. Together, these data demonstrate that germination drives neutrophil-mediated killing ofA.fumigatus, and explain why a faster germinating strain is actually cleared more effectively by innate immune cells than a slower-growing strain (Fig 10). Fig 10. Model of neutrophil and macrophage responses toAspergillus fumigatus. Upon infection,A.fumigatusspores are taken up by macrophages, which form dense clusters around the fungus and inhibit spore germination. Macrophages provide a protective niche for spore survival, as neutrophil-mediated killing ofA.fumigatusrequires germination. As a result, in infections with slow-germinatingA.fumigatusstrains, the fungus persists for days, while in infections with fast-germinatingA.fumigatusstrains, germination drives neutrophil recruitment, neutrophil-mediated killing, and faster fungal clearance. Macrophages have some anti-fungal activity, dependent on Myd88-NF-κB signaling, however NF-κB activation is not sufficient to kill slow-germinating strains. Here we have used larval zebrafish to imageAspergillus fumigatusinfection in live, intact hosts, over the course of a multi-day infection to visualize and quantify both immune cell behavior and fungal development and growth. Using a method to visually quantify spore killing, we find that faster-growing CEA10-derived strains ofA.fumigatusare cleared significantly better than slower-growing Af293-derived strains. We report that clearance of CEA10-derived strains is primarily due to neutrophil function and is driven by fungal germination, whereas slower-growing Af293-derived strains do not recruit as many neutrophils and therefore can persist in the host for >5 days. Many fungal pathogens can survive within macrophages [40], but the role of macrophagesin vivoinA.fumigatuspathogenesis has remained ambiguous, and we find that macrophages form tight clusters around injected spores. Macrophages inhibit spore germination, and without spore germination, neutrophil recruitment and neutrophil-mediated killing are diminished, thus macrophages act as a protective niche against neutrophil-mediated killing (Fig 10). The phagocyte clusters that we observe are reminiscent of aspergillomas or “fungal granulomas” that are found in lung or intracranial lesions of human patients [41,42]. These macrophage-driven phagocyte clusters have never been observed before in an animal model ofAspergillusinfection, but phagocyte clustering is a common phenomenon in infections, with the mycobacteria granuloma as the classic example [43]. We do find some neutrophils infiltrating into these clusters and neutrophil aggregates have been reported in response to both toAspergillus[12] andCandida[44]. Zebrafish larvae have been an ideal model in which to detect phagocyte clusters, and they have been found in response to not just mycobacteria [45], but alsoStreptococcus iniaie[46] andMucor circinelloides[47]. In tuberculosis, granulomas can provide bacterial-protective functions [48] and macrophages can also act as protective niches for other pathogens [49].In vivo, in larval zebrafish, macrophages do not have much spore killing ability, in contrast to what has been foundin vitro[4,5], but in line with somein vivomouse experiments [6]. While in other mouse experiments macrophage depletion led to an increase inA.fumigatusfungal burden [7], we hypothesize that the protective niche function of macrophages is only relevant at lower doses of spores, not at the dose given in these experiments (~107). Our data suggest that the protective niche function of macrophages arises simply by inhibition of fungal germination (Fig 10). While it is also possible that macrophages actively repel neutrophils, as we have observed this behavior in other inflammatory contexts [50], we cannot conclude this from the data presented here. Neutrophils are highly efficient killers ofA.fumigatus, and we find that this killing is largely dependent on germination. Whether neutrophils respond directly to signals exposed on hyphae or if epithelial cells and/or macrophages sense hyphae and recruit neutrophils in this context is not known. In mice, the neutrophil response to CEA10 is dependent on IL-1α production [27]. IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) signaling requires the Myd88 adaptor protein, but our experiments withmyd88-/-larvae demonstrate that Myd88 is not required for neutrophil recruitment and killing in this context. The Card9 adaptor can also transduce fungal signals to recruit neutrophils [34], and we hypothesize that this signaling is occurring in macrophage-deficient larvae to recruit neutrophils. Interestingly, in mice, neutrophil recruitment to Af293 and CEA10 infections is driven by different pathways and signals, in agreement with the differences we observe in the ability of these strains to recruit neutrophils [27]. In addition to inducing neutrophil recruitment, germination likely also makesA.fumigatusmore susceptible to host killing mechanismsin vivo. In fact, we find that a slower-germinating Af293-derived strain is not effectively killed by the host even in a co-infection with a faster-germinating CEA10-derived strain. Hyphal growth and branching increases susceptibility to neutrophil-mediated killingin vitro[51], and it has long been thought that neutrophils are much more effective killers against hyphae than conidia [52]. One immune mechanism that neutrophils use against hyphae is neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which are observed in infected mouse lung tissue containing hyphae [20,53]. In the absence of macrophages and the increased presence of hyphae we observed large masses of sudan black staining at the site of infection that are reminiscent of NETs. Sudan black stains neutrophil granules, and therefore these masses could be actual NETs, neutrophil degranulation, or simply massive neutrophil recruitment. It is worth noting that in imaging neutrophils expressing a cytosolic fluorescent protein recruited to the site of infection we could sometimes see a haziness in that channel suggesting neutrophil lysis, but could not prove the origin of this signal. Differences in virulence between Af293 and CEA10 are also observed in murine models ofAspergillusinfection. In a chemotherapeutic model of immunosuppression, infection with either of these strains caused similar rates of host death [26], a situation that may be similar to our dexamethasone-treated zebrafish larvae (Fig 2C). In a less immunosuppressed triamcinolone-treated mouse model, CEA10 is more virulent [26]. However, this increase in virulence is thought to be a result of increased resistance to hypoxia, a hallmark of this model [26], while we do not know the hypoxic state of our zebrafish immunosuppression models. Murine studies have correlated the increased growth and germination of CEA10 compared to Af293 with increased tissue damage [27], but have also found that increased growthin vitroacross multiple environmental and clinical isolates correlates with increased host survival in the triamcinolone-treated mouse model [26], possibly consistent with our findings that increased growth leads to increased host response and clearance mechanisms. Between these strains ofA.fumigatus, we have identified two different virulence mechanisms, both of which are commonly observed in a variety of human pathogens. CEA10-derived strains can germinate quicklyin vivo, and therefore under neutrophil-deficient conditions can cause disease and spread. On the other hand, Af293-derived strains do not germinate quickly but instead can persist largely undetected in the host. This latter mechanism is similar to one proposed for a differentAspergillusspecies,A.terreus[54], and for the fungal pathogenCryptococcus neoformans[55]. These two different mechanisms highlight the contradiction underlyingAspergilluspathogenesis: while germination is required for virulence, it simultaneously activates the immune system and immune mechanisms that can kill the fungus. These ideas are relevant for the development and deployment of anti-Aspergillustreatments. Are there particular host scenarios in which it is better to simply inhibit germination and allowAspergillusspores to persist? Or others where it is better to induce germination to activate host immune responses? Drugs that target macrophages to both maintain their ability to inhibit germination and increase neutrophil recruitment could provide the best possible scenario for future immunotherapies. Future investigation of the mechanisms behind each of these macrophage behaviors will be required to further understand the molecules and pathways involved. Animal care and use protocol M005405-A02 was approved by the University of Wisconsin-Madison College of Agricultural and Life Sciences (CALS) Animal Care and Use Committee. This protocol adheres to the federal Health Research Extension Act and the Public Health Service Policy on the Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, overseen by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW). Zebrafish lines and maintenance All zebrafish were maintained as described previously [56]. Prior to any experimental manipulation, larvae were anesthetized in E3 water containing 0.2 mg/ml Tricaine (ethyl 3-aminobenzoate, Sigma). Previously published and established splice-blocking morpholino oligonucleotides (MO, GeneTools) were re-suspended in water to a stock concentration of 1 mM. MOs were then diluted in water with 0.5X CutSmart Buffer (NEB) and 0.1% phenol red and 3 nl was micro-injected into single-cell stage embryos. Injected concentrations of morpholinos were 0.4 mM (irf8(ZFIN MO1: aatgtttcgcttactttgaaaatgg)[63]), 0.5 mM (pu.1(ZFIN MO1: gatatactgatactccattggtggt)[64]), and 0.33 mM (myd88(ZFIN MO2: gttaaacactgaccctgtggatcat)[65]). These injected amounts ofirf8andpu.1MO are standard and efficacy of knockdown was previously confirmed [63,64]. To confirm the splice-blocking effect of themyd88morpholino at this concentration, RNA was isolated from individual larvae with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and cDNA was synthesized with SuperScript III RT and oligo-dT (Invitrogen). PCR was then performed with GoTaq (Promega) and primers formyd88(F: 5’-atggcatcaaagttaagtatagacc-3’, R: 5’-agggcagtgagagtgctttg-3’) andef1a(F: 5’-tgccttcgtcccaatttcag-3’, R: 5’-taccctccttgcgctcaatc-3’)[66]. Shifts in band size were evaluated by agarose gel electrophoresis. Forirf8andmyd88MO injections, a standard control MO (GeneTools) was used at a matching concentration. At 1.5 dpf, 2 nl of clodronate or PBS liposomes (Liposoma) with 0.1% phenol red was micro-injected intravenously into the caudal vein plexus of transgenic larvae expressing a fluorescent macrophage marker. Macrophage depletion was confirmed 24 hours later by loss of signal on a fluorescent zoomscope (EMS3/SyCoP3; Zeiss; Plan-NeoFluar Z objective) prior to hindbrain injection ofA.fumigatus. Aspergillus fumigatusgrowth and spore microinjection Single larvae were placed in 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes with 90 μl of 1x PBS containing 500 μg/ml Kanamycin and 500 μg/ml Gentamycin and homogenized in a mini bead beater at maximum speed for 10–20 seconds. The entire volume was plated on a 10 cm GMM plate, incubated for two days at 37°C, and CFUs were counted. For each CFU experiment, ≥8 larvae were individually plated for each time point and each condition. For co-infection CFU experiments, fluorescence of colonies was visualized on a zoomscope (EMS3/SyCoP3; Zeiss; Plan-NeoFluar Z objective) to specifically count colonies of each strain. All CFU data were normalized to the average initial injection dose for each replicate and condition. Spore cell walls were labeled with AlexaFluor molecules as previously described [10]. Briefly, biotin-XX, SSE (Life Technologies) was conjugated to spores in 0.05 M NaHCO3. Spores were washed in Tris-HCl pH 8 to deactivate free-floating biotin, then washed in PBS, and incubated with streptavidin-AF594 or -AF633 (Life Technologies). Labeling was confirmed by fluorescence imaging and spores were resuspended in PBS and injected as described above. To prevent pigment formation, 0.2 mM N-phenylthiourea (PTU, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to E3 water 1 dpf. Larvae carrying fluorescent transgenes were pre-screened on a zoomscope (EMS3/SyCoP3; Zeiss; Plan-NeoFluar Z objective) prior to the experiment. For daily imaging, larvae were maintained in single wells of a 48-well plate. Each day, larvae were removed, one at a time, anesthetized in E3 with Tricaine, and placed into zWEDGI chambers [73] to correctly orient their hindbrains towards the bottom of the dish. Images were acquired on a spinning disk confocal microscope (CSU-X; Yokogawa) with a confocal scanhead on a Zeiss Observer Z.1 inverted microscope, Plan-Apochromat NA 0.8/20x objective, and a Photometrics Evolve EMCCD camera. Images were acquired with ZEN software (Zeiss). After imaging was complete, larvae were washed in E3 with PTU and placed back into the same plate well. To image AlexaFluor-labeled spores, larvae were also imaged in zWEDGI chambers [73] on the same spinning disk confocal microscope with an EC Plan-Neofluar NA 0.75/40x objective. Clodronate-injected larvae were also imaged with the spinning disk confocal with a EC Plan-Neofluar NA 0.3/10x objective. To image GFP expression in theNF-κB RE:GFPline, 2 days post injection (dpi) larvae were mounted in a glass-bottom dish with 1% low-melting point agarose. Images were acquired with a laser-scanning confocal microscope (FluoView FV1000; Olympus) with an NA 0.75/20x objective and FV10-ASW software (Olympus). To imagemfap4:tomato-caaxlarvae, larvae at 3 dpi (for macrophage cluster imaging) or 1 dpi (for co-infection imaging) were mounted in agarose and imaged on the Olympus laser-scanning confocal microscope as described above. In all displayed images, image histogram levels were adjusted in Fiji. For any experiments where fluorescence intensity of images was quantified, no alteration was made to images prior to analysis. To quantify killing of AlexaFluor-labeled spores (Fig 1B and 1C), alive and killed spores were manually counted in Fiji. Displayed images of Alexa-Fluor labeled spores were also processed in Fiji with bilinear interpolation to increase the pixel density two-fold. To quantify GFP signal from theNF-κB RE:GFPzebrafish line (Fig 2A and 2B), a single slice from each z-stack representing the center of the hindbrain was isolated. In Fiji, the hindbrain region was manually identified in the corresponding brightfield image and the mean grey value as well as the integrated density (area × mean grey value) in that region in the GFP channel was measured. Displayed images of GFP signal were also processed in Fiji with bilinear interpolation to increase the pixel density two-fold. Signal intensity is displayed with the 16 colors look up table. To quantify phagocyte recruitment and fungal growth (Figs4,7and8), z-stacks and/or maximum intensity projections were analyzed in Fiji. Cell numbers, phagocyte cluster area, and presence of germination and/or invasive hyphae were scored manually. 2D fungal area was calculated by thresholding. Images of phagocyte recruitment (Fig 4C) were processed in Fiji with bilinear interpolation to increase the pixel density two-fold followed by a gaussian blur (radius = 0.75). Images inS1 Moviewere processed in Fiji with bilinear interpolation to increase the pixel density two-fold followed by a gaussian blur (radius = 1). The displayed image of tomato+ clustered cells (Fig 4E) was processed in Fiji with bilinear interpolation to increase the pixel density four-fold followed by a gaussian blur (radius = 2). For co-infection imaging quantification (Fig 3), pair-wise distances between spores in each larvae were measured manually in Fiji. Displayed images of co-infection were processed in Fiji with bilinear interpolation to increase the pixel density two-fold followed by a gaussian blur (radius = 1). Whole larvae images of macrophages and neutrophils after clodronate injection (S6A Fig) were manually assembled. Images ofA.fumigatusinfected clodronate-depleted or control larvae (S7A Fig) were processed in Fiji with bilinear interpolation to increase the pixel density two-fold followed by a gaussian blur (radius = 0.75). Dexamethasone (Sigma) was resuspended to a stock concentration of 10 mM in 100% ethanol. Larvae were treated with 10 μM dexamethasone, or equivalent ethanol control (0.1%) immediately after infection and the drug was left on larvae for the entirety of the experiment. Withaferin A was resuspended in DMSO to a stock concentration of 10 mM. 2 hpi, E3 was changed to E3 with 30 μM withaferin A (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or DMSO (0.3%). 24 hpi, drug was removed and larvae were placed back in E3 alone. Sudan black staining was performed as described in protocoldx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.rced2te. For visualization of sudan black staining (and YFP/GFP of injected fungus), larvae were placed into zWEDGI wells [73] to correctly orient their hindbrains and imaged on a spinning disk confocal microscope (CSU-X; Yokogawa) with a confocal scanhead on a Zeiss Observer Z.1 inverted microscope, Plan-Apochromat NA 0.8/20x objective, a Photometrics Evolve EMCCD camera, and ZEN software (Zeiss). Larvae were anesthetized and placed on a glass slide. As much liquid as possible was removed, 5 μl of 1 g/L calcofluor white was pipetted on top of the larvae, and a glass coverslip was placed on top. Smashed larvae were imaged for the presence of calcofluor-white stained hyphae within 10 minutes on a Zeiss Observer Z.1 inverted microscope with a EC Plan-Neofluar NA 0.30/10x objective and epifluorescence images were taken with a Photometrics Coolsnap ES2camera and ZEN software (Zeiss). Wild-type larvae were infected with Af293-derived strains (Af293, TBK1.1, TBK5.1) or CEA10-derived strains (CEA10, CEA17 KU80Δ, TFYL49.1) and fungal burden was monitored by CFUs.
