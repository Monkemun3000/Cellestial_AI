Received 2021 Dec 8; Accepted 2022 Jan 14; Prepublished 2022 Jan 19; Collection date 2022 Mar. RNA polymerase (RNAP) is a highly conserved macromolecular machine that contributes to the flow of genetic information from genotype to phenotype. InBacillus subtilis, mutations in therpoBgene encoding the β-subunit of RNAP have been shown to alter a number of global phenotypes, including growth, utilization of unusual nutrient sources, sporulation, germination, and production of secondary metabolites. In addition, the spectrum of mutations inrpoBleading to rifampin resistance (Rifr) can change dramatically depending upon the environment to whichB. subtiliscells or spores are exposed. RifrrpoBmutations have historically been associated with slower growth and reduced fitness; however, these assessments of fitness were conducted on limited collections of mutants in rich laboratory media that poorly reflect natural environments typically inhabited byB. subtilis. Using a novel deep-sequencing approach in addition to traditional measurements of growth rate, lag time, and pairwise competitions, we demonstrated that the competitive advantages of specificrpoBalleles differ depending on the growth environment in which they are determined. IMPORTANCEMicrobial resistance to antibiotics is a growing threat to public health across the world. Historically, resistance to antibiotics has been associated with reduced fitness. A growing body of evidence indicates that resistance to rifampin, a frontline antibiotic used to treat mycobacterial and biofilm-associated infections, may increase fitness given an appropriate environment even in the absence of the selective antibiotic. Here, we experimentally confirm this phenomenon by directly comparing the fitness of multiple rifampin-resistant mutants ofBacillus subtilisin rich LB medium and an asparagine minimal medium. Our research demonstrates that the fitness cost of rifampin resistance can vary greatly depending upon the environment. This has important implications for understanding how microbes develop antimicrobial resistance in the absence of antibiotic selection. Transcription in bacteria depends on a complex of proteins collectively known as RNA polymerase (RNAP), and bacterial responses to their environment are in large part due to alterations in their global pattern of transcription, i.e., the transcriptome. Because RNAP physically contacts every promoter in the bacterial genome, mutations altering RNAP can exert wide-ranging pleiotropic effects on the transcriptome, and hence, the resulting phenotype and fitness of a cell growing in a particular environment. The antibiotic rifampin (Rif) is a potent inhibitor of prokaryotic transcription initiation (1) and has a long history of use in the treatment of infectious diseases, particularly tuberculosis and leprosy caused byMycobacteriumspp., as well as biofilm-associated infections (2). In addition to its clinical importance, Rif has long been used to probe the structure and function of RNAP. Resistance to Rif (Rifr) arises from mutations in therpoBgene, encoding the β subunit of RNAP (3). Binding of Rif to RNAP occurs at a specific site on the β subunit, the Rif-binding pocket, which physically blocks the progression of nascent transcripts through the RNA exit channel (4,5). Mutations conferring Rifrare localized on the primary sequence ofrpoBin four regions designated the N cluster and clusters I, II, and III (4,6). The majority of Rifrmutations occur in cluster I, and elucidation of the three-dimensional structure of RNAP bound to Rif has revealed that the Rif binding pocket consists of several key amino acids within cluster I that make direct contact with Rif (4). In the Gram-positive model organismBacillus subtilis, Rifrmutations inrpoBhave been shown to affect a number of global phenotypes, including deficiencies in sporulation, competence, growth rate, and yield (7), activation of cryptic genes involved in the utilization of rare carbon sources (8), altered resistance of spores to various sporicidal stresses (9), temperature-sensitive sporulation (10), and spore germination (7). Not all sites in cluster I ofrpoBare prone to mutation at equal frequency; some bases mutate at higher frequency (“hot spots”) or lower frequency (“cold spots”). Such patterns of mutation in a gene are referred to as its mutational spectrum (11). In prior communications, we have reported several instances in which the Rifrmutational spectrum in theB. subtilisrpoBgene is changed when cells are cultivated in different physiological environments or when spores are exposed to different environmental extremes (12–17). Most recently, we reported on differences in the spectrum of Rifrmutations between populations grown in complete Miller LB medium (LB) and populations grown in Spizizen minimal medium containingl-asparagine as the sole carbon source (SMMAsn) (18). We observed that the major Riframino acid change in LB cultures was H482Y (a change of H to Y at position 482), while the major mutation in SMMAsncultures was S487L (18). How does exposure of a cell or spore to a particular environment lead to an altered mutational spectrum? At least two explanations for this phenomenon can be posited, which are not mutually exclusive. (i) One of the explanations is that under different physiological conditions, changes in the intracellular environment can cause alterations in nucleoid architecture, DNA supercoiling, and DNA conformation; such structural alterations can alter the probability of mutation at a particular base within a gene. This notion is supported by the observed differences both in DNA structure and in the spectrum ofrpoBmutations between vegetative cells and spores inB. subtilis, where the mutagenic spectrum of spores more closely resembled the spectrum observed in clinicalMycobacterium tuberculosisisolates (12). Differences in the spectrum ofrpoBmutations have also been observed inB. subtilisspores exposed to a number of extreme environmental conditions, including simulated Mars conditions (13), ultrahigh vacuum (19), and exposure to space in low-Earth orbit (15). It should be noted that in the examples listed above, dormant spores themselves were exposed to different environments and then allowed to germinate and grow under the same laboratory conditions; hence, differences in mutational spectrum cannot be attributed to different growth environments. (ii) The second explanation is that growth under selective pressure produces a spectrum of mutations within a population and those mutants with the lowest fitness cost or those with a fitness advantage become more prevalent. Supporting this line of thought, Wrande et al. (20) illustrated that the logarithmic accumulation of Rifrmutations in agingSalmonella entericaandEscherichia colicolonies is due to clonal growth of Rifrmutants in localized “jackpots” within the colony. These Rifralleles were found to have a selective advantage over their respective ancestral strains within the context of these aging colonies. Similarly, study of RifrStaphylococcus aureusmutants isolated from biofilms revealed that Rifrmutants exhibited greater fitness when cocultured with the wild-type strain in a biofilm liquid culture (21).

Data shown are average values (n= 3). (B to D) Population dynamics of wild-type (WT), D472Y, and H482N strains during the three replicate competition experiments from which the average values in panel A were derived. During multiallele competition in LB medium, we noted that the A478DrpoBmutant rose to prominence in one of the three replicate cultures (Fig. 3D), presumably due to a second-site mutation(s). Accordingly, we also examined the frequencies of the wild-type, D472Y, and H482N strains in each individual SMMAsnculture (Fig. 5BtoD). In this case, all three cultures behaved similarly, with the H482N strain arising to dominate each of the three cultures. This observation suggested that no second-site mutation(s) improving fitness had arisen in the SMMAsncultures during the course of the multiallele competition experiment.

Data are average values ± standard deviations (n= 3). ***,P <0.001; ****,P <0.0001; ns, not significantly different (two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s HSD test for multiple comparisons). Previous work in our laboratory has shown differing spectra of mutations in therpoBgene across several different environment (12,13,16–18). The reproducibility of these changes in the spectra of mutations indicates that the environment somehow dictates these changes. Multiple studies have found that mutations in therpoBgene that confer rifampin resistance can provide a fitness advantage or increased growth rate in the environment from which they were isolated. Several examples illustrate the repeated occurrence ofrpoBmutations in adaptive laboratory evolution ofEscherichia coli, wherein these mutations significantly increased the fitness of the organism in different environments, including optimized growth on various minimal media and increased fitness at elevated temperatures (30–32). Our multiallele, multigenerational competition experiments (Fig. 3and5) showed that the wild-typerpoBallele was most fit in nutrient-rich LB medium, while the H482N variant was most fit in populations cultivated in minimal SMMAsnmedium. The differentrpoBalleles and the corresponding changes in global gene expression associated with them likely explain the differences in relative fitness depending upon the growth environment. Numerous studies suggest changes in global gene expression to be the cause of changes in fitness observed with mutations inrpoB(7,33–37), although one study examining the system-wide impacts of mutations in thePseudomonas aeruginosarpoBgene found few differences in global gene expression and attributed mutant phenotypes to increased expression of RNAP (38). Ultimately, a better understanding of the specific mechanisms behind these differences in fitness will require an examination of global gene expression of these differentrpoBalleles in SMMAsn. Which changes in gene expression are specifically responsible for the success of the H482N mutant can only be speculated upon at present, as this particular allele is new to our collection and not yet very well characterized. However, the lack of fitness of the S487L mutant in SMMAsnmay be a bit easier to explain. Previous work studying therpoB-S487L allele inB. subtilisrevealed that this particular allele autoinduced the expression of genes responsible for the production of the antibiotic 3,3′-neotrehalosadiamine (NTD), which is not produced by the wild-type strain under the same conditions (39). This autoinduction of NTD production might place a significant metabolic burden on the organism and may be responsible for the lack of relative fitness observed in therpoB-S487L allele. Bacterial strains, media, plasmids, and growth conditions. For quantification of Rifr, an overnight culture of each strain was grown in liquid TSY without antibiotics. One microliter of overnight culture was inoculated into 100 μl of liquid TSY medium without Rif or containing Rif at a 2-fold range of concentrations from 4 to 256 μg/mL. Cells were grown in 96-well microtiter plates sealed with gas-permeable membranes (Breathe-Easy; Sigma-Aldrich). Growth at 37°C was measured by the optical density at 620 nm (OD620) at 15-minute intervals in a temperature-controlled microplate absorbance spectrophotometer (model ELx808; BioTek). The resulting growth data from triplicate experiments were then used to determine the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50). Growth rate and lag time determinations. Liquid cultures were propagated in 125-mL sidearm (Klett) flasks in 10 mL of LB at 37°C in a rotary shaking bath with vigorous aeration. Growth was measured at 15-minute intervals by the OD660using a Klett-Summerson colorimeter fitted with the no. 66 (red, 660-nm) filter. Growth rates were calculated from the exponential portion of each growth curve. Lag times were determined from the point of intersection of the lag and exponential portions of each growth curve. Growth rates and lag times were determined from triplicate cultures. Data sets were tested for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test online calculator (https://www.statskingdom.com/shapiro-wilk-test-calculator.html), and all data sets were found to be normally distributed. Statistical parameters and tests of significance (analysis of variance [ANOVA]) were computed using KaleidaGraph version 4.5.2 (Synergy Software, Reading, PA, USA). Individual overnight cultures of the wild-type strain and all congenic Rifrstrains were inoculated into fresh individual 2-mL LB cultures. Upon entering stationary phase, the OD660of each culture was measured and a volume corresponding to ∼108cells of each strain was combined into a single mixed culture, which was then diluted 1:100 into 10 mL of either LB or SMMAsnin 125-mL Erlenmeyer flasks. Cultures were grown at 37°C in a temperature-controlled rotary shaking bath at 200 rpm. Every 24 h, cultures were diluted 1:100 into fresh medium. Under these conditions, cultures progress through ∼7 generations per day (53). For multiallelic competition experiments, every 24 h, from each culture, a 1-mL aliquot was pelleted for chromosomal DNA extraction; 0.8 mL was stored in 25% (vol/vol) glycerol at −70°C, and 0.1 mL was diluted serially 10-fold in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), plated on LB with chloramphenicol (Cm), and incubated overnight at 37°C for total viable counts. For two-allele competition experiments, every 24 h, 0.1 mL of each culture was serially diluted and plated on two different LB plates, each supplemented with a different antibiotic. These LB plates were then incubated overnight at 37°C to determine the viable counts of each strain. Relative fitness was quantified with a previously described selection coefficient model (54).

Quality control of reads was performed with FastQC (55). Quality reads were mapped to theBacillus subtilisstrain 168 reference genome (GenBank accession numberAL009126.3) using Bowtie 2 (56). From mapped reads, LoFreq (57) was used to call single-nucleotide polymorphisms and small deletions in therpoBgene. Preliminary calibration experiments performed with known proportions of mutantrpoBalleles established that the lower limit of detection was ∼0.1% (data not shown). All data sets were tested for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk method (58). Data sets passing the normality test were analyzed for differences by ANOVA with Tukey’s honestly significant difference (HSD) test (59) or Dunnett’s test for multiple comparison analysis (60). All statistical analyses were performed with the statistical graphing software Prism (GraphPad Software). Differences with aPvalue of <0.05 were considered statistically significant.
