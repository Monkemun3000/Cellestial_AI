  "content": "The dynamics of protein-protein interactions between domains of MscL at the cytoplasmic-lipid interface Correspondence to: Paul Blount, Email:paul.blount@utsouthwestern.edu The bacterial mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) ofE. coliis to date one of the best studied mechanosensitive channels serving as a paradigm for how channels sense and respond to mechanical stimuli.1The physiological role of MscL in bacteria is osmoregulation2; upon a sudden decrease in the osmolarity of the environment (hypo-osmotic shock) water enters the bacterial cell, producing cell swelling and creating tension in the membrane. MscL gates in response to this membrane tension3acting as an emergency release valve that allows the rapid flow of water and solute and preventing cell lysis. MscL opens a large pore, estimated size of 30 Å4in response to membrane tensions close to the lytic value of the membrane.5 A crystal structure of MscL from the homologM. tuberculosishas been solved at 3.5 Å resolution6,7(Fig. 1). It reflects what is thought to be a closed state of MscL, although much data now suggests it may not reflect the totally closed state seen in vivo.1,8,9The channel is a homopentamer with each subunit consisting of two transmembrane domains. Both the C and N-terminals have been shown to be cytoplasmic. Although a second structure exists for theS. aureusortholog showing a tetrameric oligomerization,10further studies have since shown that this ortholog is actually pentameric in vivo, and that the tetrameric re-organization is a detergent-specific process11,12; hence, only the pentameric structure is discussed here. Figure 1.Schematic representation of MscL from the crystal structure ofM. tuberculosis. (A) The scheme on the left represents a pentameric MscL in a closed state with the S1 and TM2cidomains, in which the cysteine substitutions were performed, highlighted for clarity. The approximate location of the membrane is shown with horizontal gray lines. A single subunit is shown on the right to indicate all different MscL domains. (B)The same model with CPK representation of its residues shows how close the S1 and TM2cidomains are predicted to be in the closed structure of MscL. In the bottom view it can be appreciated that the S1 and TM2cidomains of alternating subunits, not direct neighbors, interact with each other. Upon gating, the best evidence suggests that the two transmembrane domains tilt within the membrane; as they do so, the first transmembrane TM1 twists in a cork-screw-like manner in a clockwise direction (when observed from the periplasm), and the channel then opens like the iris of an old-fashion camera. Note that in the crystal structure a vestibule of the closed pore is observed within the periplasmic side of the membrane, with the pore constriction occurring in the cytoplasmic region of the transmembrane domains. Several studies have shown that this cytoplasmic-constriction region is important for channel gating. The N-terminal helix (S1) lies along the membrane and has been shown necessary for channel gating13,14; It appears to anchor TM1 to the cytoplasmic side of the membrane and is thought to guide its tilting within the membrane during the gating process.15,16The region of TM2 near the cytoplasmic interface, (TM2ci;Fig. 1), has also been shown to influence the gating process. One of the residues within this subdomain, N103, has been shown to be incorporated into the membrane upon gating, presumably to accommodate for the longer tilted TM domains in the open state. Several additional residues in the TM2ciregion are also crucial for this transition, thus tuning the gating of the channel. Although the structural data from the MscL crystal structure shows that the S1 and TM2cidomains are in very close proximity (Fig. 1B), little is known about protein-protein interactions in this region and their possible influence in the gating process. In this study we use an in vivo disulfide trapping assay to screen 143 double cysteine mutants to generate a detailed map of protein-protein interactions between S1 and TM2cidomains. Furthermore, to understand the dynamics of these interactions during the closed to open transition inE. coliMscL, we analyze the effects in single channel activity of different redox conditions by patch clamp. Two sets of mutants have shown changes in their activities under different redox conditions and suggest a model consistent with a concerted motion of the S1 domain and TM2ci. In this work we study protein-protein interactions between S1 (S2-M12) and TM2ci(F93-K105) residues inE. coliMscL channel (Fig. 1) by using an in vivo disulfide trapping assay.17We chose to perform this in vivo assay because it involves little or no manipulation of the protein and is therefore more likely to reflect real protein-protein interactions, eliminating possible artifacts occurring during protein purification. Briefly, bacteria expressing each double mutant were grown in high salt media and either diluted in media of the same osmolarity (control) or lower osmolarity (osmotic down-shock) with the oxidizing agent copper-phenanthroline. After a brief incubation the bacteria were pelleted, resuspended in sample buffer, run in an electrophoresis gel and visualized in a western blot with a MscL antibody. Interestingly, we found that interactions between S1 and TM2cidomains are so efficient that only 1.5 µM copper-phenanthroline had to be used in order not to saturate the screen. Figure 3.Bridging M12C/N103C mutant locks the channel in a closed state (A). The scheme shows the corresponding position of the cysteine substituted residues M12 (red) and N103 (blue) in MscLM. tuberculosisstructure, which reflects a nearly closed state. The insert is an amplification of the detail inside the square to show how close these two residues are predicted to be. (B) Western blot of M12C/N103C MscL derived from cells non-shocked (NS, left lane) or down-shocked in presence of 1.5 µM of the oxidizer copper-phenanthroline (S, right lane). Note that the protein derived from the shocked cells exists almost exclusively as a pentamer (97% of total protein). (C) Patch clamp analysis of M12C/N103C MscL in giant spheroplasts shows differential activities under different redox conditions. The traces show the M12C/N103C MscL channel activity elicited by applying negative pressure to the patch (in mmHg, below the traces). After adding the reducing agent DTT to the bath (upper trace), channel activity could be observed; but after washing the DTT from the bath and adding peroxide (lower trace) the channels were locked closed and could not be activated even at higher negative pressures. On the other side of the graph, one of the peaks reflecting multimerization is I3C/I96C. These residues are not predicted to interact in the closed structure of MscL, but still show that more than 50% of the protein in the western blot is forming multimers (Fig. Four A, B). Patch clamp experiments show that I3C/I96C single channel activity can be elicited both in the presence of reducing or oxidizing agents in the bath (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, a more detailed analysis of the amplitude of the channel in different redox conditions showed that in the presence of the oxidizer the channel is stabilized in a sub-conductive state (Fig. Four C, D). Figure 4.Bridging I3C/I96C locks the channel into a sub-conducting state. (A) The scheme shows the corresponding position of the cysteine substituted residues I3 (red) and I96 (blue) in MscLM. tuberculosisstructure. The insert is an amplification of the detail inside the square to show that I3 and I96 are not predicted to interact with each other in the closed MscL channel. (B) Western blot of I3C/I96C MscL derived from cells non-shocked (NS, left lane) or down-shocked in presence of 1.5 µM of the oxidizer copper-phenanthroline (S, right lane). Note that the protein derived from the shocked cells exists in multiple states from dimmers to pentamers, with multimers (3X to 5X) representing 54% of total protein. (C) Patch clamp analysis of I3C/I96C MscL in giant spheroplasts shows that the channel locks in a sub-conductive stated under oxidizing conditions. The traces show the I3C/I96C MscL channel activity elicited by applying negative pressure to the patch (in mmHg, below the traces). Under reducing conditions DTT (upper trace) channel activity could be observed with most openings reaching a single conductive state (o). After washing the DTT from the bath and adding peroxide (lower trace) the channels could still be activated but they stabilized in a sub-conductive state (s). (D) Amplitude histogram of traces from I3C/I96C patches under reducing (DTT red line) or oxidizing (peroxide blue line) conditions. Note that in the presence of peroxide a sub-conductive state is stabilized. Figure 5.Correlation between multimer peaks and channel activity of MscL double mutants under different redox potentials. In a simplified version of the 3D graph shown inFigure 2, the multimer peaks for seven additional mutants are highlighted with red (mutants that lock close upon oxidation) or green (do not lock close upon oxidation). The inserts show the corresponding position inM. tuberculosismodel of the substituted residues inE. coliMscL. Just two subunits are shown for clarity; residues in green are in S1 and those in red in TM2ci. For each mutant the traces show single channel activity under reducing (black) or oxidizing (blue) conditions. The number under each trace is the negative pressure applied to the patch. Scale bars on the right bottom apply to all traces. Our current model for S1 function is that it serves as a stabilizer for the twisting and turning of the pore-forming first transmembrane domain.15In addition, all current models for the structural changes that occur upon gating include a tilting of both transmembrane domains within the plane of the membrane. In addition to tilting, for TM1 several lines of evidence also suggest a clockwise “corkscrewing” of TM1 of almost 180°, as would be observed from the periplasm; these lines of evidence include EPR experiments,20disulfide trapping experiments within the pore9and between TM1 and TM2 upon gating,17accessibility and gating influences of the sulfhydryl reagent MTSET+on TM cysteine mutants,21,22and the engineering of heavy metal binding sites within the pore region.8The S1 amphipathic helix, with its two conserved phenylalanines, is joined to this dynamic TM1 by a conserved flexible glycine residue at position 14 that has been shown to have functional significance.9,23Such a helix running along the membrane is observed in many channels including the other mechanosensitive channel in bacteria, MscS,7,24the “slide helix” of KirBac1.1,25a putative amphipathic “gate anchor” domain studied in TRPY1,26and several others where they may also serve as stabilizers. Although TM2 is not thought to “corkscrew” within the membrane, it is thought to tilt within it upon gating. Indeed, a recent study of the dynamics of the TM2ciregion has shown that channel gating can be influenced by modifications that make this region more hydrophobic.27One residue, N103, was even shown to transiently insert into the membrane during the gating process in a piston-like manner. Hence, this region shows a dynamics within and along the membrane upon channel opening. Collectively, the data from this study, as well as many others, have led to a cohesive model of how MscL senses and responds to mechanical forces. We know, for instance, that MscL senses the tension in the membrane3; more specifically, changes within the lateral pressure profile.28The observation that many other mechanosensors also have lower thresholds or are activated by amphipaths suggests this is a common stimulus for MS channels.29Furthermore, the observation that the channel can function in a bilayer composed of phosphatidylcholine, which contains a zwitter-ionic headgroup not synthesized byE. coli, demonstrates that neither interactions with negatively charged lipids nor native lipid headgroups are required for normal MS channel activity.3Both transmembrane domains tilt within the membrane, and TM1 rotates in a corkscrew fashion clockwise, as observed from the periplasm.1Finally, this study has helped to define the interactions between the S1 and the TM2cidomains; the findings are consistent with the model of S1 maintaining its association with the cytoplasmic side of the membrane and thus serving as a stabilizer for the pore-forming TM1, and the dynamics of the TM2cisubdomain and the predicted tilting of TM2 within the membrane. E. colistrain PB104 (ΔmscL::Cm)30was used as host for the pB10 expression constructs.14,30-32PB104 was used for the in vivo cysteine trapping experiments and for the generation of spheroplasts for electrophysiological analysis. Cultures were routinely grown in Lennox Broth (LB) media (Fisher Scientific) plus ampicillin (100 mg/ml) in a shaker-incubator at 37°C and rotated at 250 cpm. Expression was induced by addition of 1 mM isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) (Anatrace). Single mutants were generated using the mega primer technique as described.9The double mutants were generated by digesting with restriction enzymes NsiI and BamHI, which separate the DNA encoding TM1 from that encoding TM2. The two fragments encoding the cysteine mutations were then ligated to generate the insert encoding the double cysteine mutants. Overnight cultures were diluted 1:100 and grown 1 h at 37°C in LB + ampicillin (approximately 410mOsmolar). LB with 1 M NaCl was then added for a final concentration of 0.5 M. Cultures were then induced with 1 mM IPTG for 1 h when an OD 600 of 0.2 was reached. Cultures were either Mock shocked (0.5 M NaCl LB) or shocked (water with 1.5 µM copper-phenanthroline) at a 1:20 dilution for 15 min at 37°C. Samples were pelleted at 4,000 g for 20 min and immediately resuspended in non-reducing sample buffer, adjusted for final OD, and run on a Criterion 4–20% gel (Bio-Rad) for western blot analysis.17Note that in less than 5 min the samples are collected and loaded on the gel. Gels were run at 200 V for 55 min. and transferred to PVDF Immobilon-P (Millipore) in Tris-Glycine, 15% methanol and 0.01% SDS for 70 min. at 110V. After blocking, the primary antibody, anti- MscL was diluted to 1:15,000 and incubated overnight at 4°C. After washing, the secondary antibody, goat anti rabbit HRP (Bio-Rad), was diluted to 1:100,000 and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The blot was then washed and developed with Millipore HRP substrate for 5 min and exposed to film. Disulfide trapping quantification The density of the bands was measured with Scion Image software (Scion Corporation). The bands in each lane were measured as two sets, monomer and dimer, and trimers to pentamers (multimers). The values are expressed as the percentage of total protein existing as multimers. E. coligiant spheroplasts were generated and used in patch-clamp experiments as described previously.33Excised, inside-out patches were examined at room temperature under symmetrical conditions using a buffer containing 200mM KCl, 90mM MgCl2, 10mM CaCl2, and 5mM HEPES pH 6 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). To study redox effects in channel activity H2O21–3% v/v or dithiothreitol (DTT) 1–10 mM (Sigma) were added to the bath. A previous study has demonstrated that this treatment has no detrimental effect on channel function.34Recordings were performed at -20 mV (positive pipette). Data were acquired at a sampling rate of 20 kHz with a 5-kHz filter using an AxoPatch 200B amplifier in conjunction with Axoscope software (Axon Instruments). A piezoelectric pressure transducer (World Precision Instruments) was used to monitor the pressure throughout the experiments. Data were analyzed using Clampfit9 from pClamp9 software (Axon Instruments). The authors graciously acknowledge their financial support.
