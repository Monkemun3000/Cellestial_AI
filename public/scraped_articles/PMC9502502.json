Differences in non-motile bacterial sedimentation rates can be observed between FPAs clinorotated at different angles at 24 h of growth; sµg, sLg, and sMg refer to simulated micro-, lunar, and Martian gravities, respectively. Shown here are cultures from a study reported separately using non-motileSalmonellaare shown, as no images were taken of this particular study. Cellular sedimentation (indicated by cyan lines) can be observed being collinear to the axis of rotation, regardless of the angle of clinostat inclination. TheE. colistrains chosen for this study were (i) ATCC®4157™, previously flown by our group on eight space shuttle flights aboard STS-37, -43, -50, -54, -57, -60, -62, and -95 [28,34] and to the ISS [19], (ii) AMG1, a uropathogenic clinical isolate from the Stanford Medical Center [35], and (iii) anrpoSknockout mutant of AMG1 to study this regulator gene’s pathways (associated with resistance to multiple types of stresses and resistance to some antibiotics on Earth via its product, the σSsigma factor [36,37,38,39,40]. The latter two strains were flown to space on NASA’s EcAMSat [40,41,42]. The uropathogens were challenged with Ciprofloxacin, the most commonly prescribed drug for UTI [43]. ATCC®4157™ was challenged with Gentamicin sulfate as in [19]. AMG1 was semi motile, AMG1 ∆rpoSwas motile, and ATCC 4157 was non-motile. A 24-h culture was diluted by 1:100 and loaded into the FPAs. The optical density (OD)595at the start of the experiment was 0.002 on average. The FPA consisted of four independent chambers, each containing 1.3 mL of culture, segregated by rubber septa. One FPA was sacrificed at each timestamp for OD data acquisition (the last timestamp had eight replicates for improved statistics). Timestamps were determined by preliminary growth curve experiments conducted at 1 g, and in the case of theE. coliAMG1 andE. coliAMG1 ∆rpoSstrains, were based on the timeline presented in Pagden et al. [40]. Additional FPAs were loaded with 10 mL of culture each for supplemental analyses, including microscopy. For the antibiotic sensitivity experiments, each FPA had two independent chambers, each containing 3 mL of culture, and enough FPAs were loaded so that there were four replicates for each tested antibiotic concentration, per each gravitational condition. The desired antibiotic concentration was prepared with the same media used in the bacterial culture as diluent and was filter sterilized. In each test, four concentrations were assessed. Drugs (Ciprofloxacin (Fisher Sci., Waltham, MA, USA, Cat. No. AC456880050) or Gentamicin Sulfate (Fisher Sci., Waltham, MA, USA, Cat. No. BP918-1)) were introduced in the bacterial culture when they reached exponential phase. At this time, two FPAs per gravitational regime were sacrificed for OD data acquisition to quantify cell concentration at the time of antibiotic introduction. Then, the four antibiotic concentrations were introduced to their respective FPAs by injecting 1 mL of antibiotic into each chamber. All FPAs were returned to their FPA Clinostat and environmental test chamber at 37 °C for 12 additional hours, following the MIC protocol described by Andrews [46], adapted to be implementable in this spaceflight hardware. In this assay, bacterial cultures are challenged with increasing concentrations of antibiotics to find the minimum concentration of a given drug sufficient to inhibit bacterial growth under those conditions. Growth inhibition is determined by statistically comparing cell concentration after 12 h of drug challenge against the cell concentration at the time of antibiotic introduction. 3.4. Code to Determine Clinostat Rotational Speed One of the unique attributes of microgravity at the cellular level in a liquid medium is an altered extracellular mass transport profile. On Earth, a cell in a liquid medium will be subject to gravity-driven forces and resultant flows, including sedimentation, buoyancy, and convection, which help transport molecules from one location to another. In microgravity, however, and for non-motile cells in particular, mass transport is limited to diffusion arising from Brownian motion, surface effects, and/or gradient-driven transport phenomena, translating into a quiescent, quasi-stable extracellular environment where incoming substrate is thought to become limited, and excreted metabolic byproducts accumulate around a cell [20,33]. Some aspects of this quiescent environment can be replicated using a clinostat on Earth to continuously rotate a vessel filled with a liquid culture, with the caveat that the 1 g vector is never removed as it is operated on Earth. Thus, the suspended cells still experience their full weight. The angular speed (ω) at which this vessel is rotated is a function of cellular and medium properties, including but not limited to cell length and diameter (normalized into an equivalent Stoke’s radius (a), mass (m), buoyancy-corrected mass (m*), particle density (ρp), medium density (ρf), viscosity (ν), and Stoke’s drag constant (f), as well as the vessel diameter (d). If the vessel is rotated too slowly, the cell will sediment away from the quiescent zone; if it is rotated too quickly, however, the cell will be centrifuged out of the quiescent zone. The position of a particle at a given time (t) can be modeled based on the aforementioned parameters via two second order, linear, separable, non-homogenous stiff differential equations [25,27,47]: wherexandyrefer to the axes of a coordinate system upon which the vessel’s circular cross section is centered at the (0,0) position. We developed a MATLAB®code based on the ode15 s ordinary differential equation solver [27], to determine the longest duration a cell would stay within the putative quiescent zone under these conditions as a function of angular speed (accessible here:https://github.com/SpaceLuisZea/Clinostat) (accessed on 9 August 2022). As inputs to the code, we used a bacterial Stoke’s diameter of5.6×10−5cm, cell mass of4.0×10−13g, growth medium viscosity of0.0102g/cm·sand density of1.011g/cm3(for reference, water’s viscosity at 25 °C and density are0.0091g/cm·sand1.000g/cm3, respectively), and an arbitrary quiescent zone diameter of 10 µm. This information (as well as recommended rotational speed) has been shared with other groups who have used our clinostats and FPAs [48]. Cultures were extracted and transferred into a 24-well plate for mixing, and from there aliquots were transferred to a 96-well plate. OD was measured at 595 nm for the growth curve and at 600 nm for MIC experiments. Cultures from the last timestamp of the growth curve for each regime were preserved by mixing 1 mL of 4% PFA (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA, Cat. No. AAJ61899AK) and 1 mL of sample. For microscopy, samples were centrifuged for two to three minutes at 900 g’s and an aliquot was transferred to a slide. Microscopy was performed on an OLYMPUS.IX81 Inverted Widefield Microscope with a 100X 1.40NA SAPO objective lens and images were captured via a Hamamatsu Orca R2 CCD camera. At each timestamp and for each gravitational regime, four replicates were sacrificed to acquire OD data. For each replicate, four aliquots were assessed, hence the OD for each regime at each timestamp was the mean of the averages of four aliquots per each of the four replicates. To determine if there were statistical differences between the gravitational regimes at 24 h, an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) for parametric datasets or Dunn test for nonparametric data sets was performed. Slopes between the beginning and end of the exponential phase were found using Microsoft Excel’s “slope” function. These slopes were compared to the 1 g control (slopegravitational regime/slope1 g). R2values were found by using Excel’s RSQ function. This same process was used to calculate the “death rate” via the slope between the stationary phase and the last timepoint in the experiment. The average length and width were calculated for 50 measurements of each condition, preserved at the last timestamp. For MIC tests, a Tukey, Kruskal, or Dunn test was performed between OD at the time of antibiotic introduction and after 12 h of being challenged with antibiotics. The lowest concentration for which there was no significance with respect to the OD at time of drug introduction was the MIC. 4.1.

E. coliAMG1 andE. coliAMG1 ∆rpoSwere challenged, separately, with increasing concentrations of Ciprofloxacin (0, 0.125, 0.25, and 0.50 mg/L) to determine the minimum concentration of antibiotic needed to inhibit their growth under each gravitational condition. The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of antibiotic under which no statistical difference in OD600(via Kruskal and Dunn tests) was observed between the time of drug introduction and 12 h later.

More importantly, it is acknowledged that a systematic verification of the validity of clinostats (and rotating wall vessels like HARV, and of random positioning machines, for that matter) needs to be performed by either including clinostat sets in spaceflight experiments, or flying experiments with clinorotated Earth controls (varying angular velocity, for example) with this very specific goal. Otherwise, simulated reduced gravity research performed in any of these types of simulation devices needs to be considered exploratory in nature and remains suggestive of what may be expected in microgravity, not determinative or conclusive in this regard, which also applies to this study. In our study, the three strains reached the stationary phase by 12 h. The AMG1 and 4157 strains showed no significant differences in OD as a function of gravitational condition at this time. On the other hand, the ∆rpoSstrain had the highest OD under simulated microgravity (35% increase with respect to 1 g), the lowest at 1 g, and sLg and sMg in between. At experiment end (t = 24 h), the highest growth was observed under simulated microgravity on the AMG1 strain (48% increase with respect to 1 g) (with simulated lunar and Martian gravities in between), and under simulated micro and Lunar gravities on the ∆rpoSstrain (44% increase with respect to 1 g) (with simulated Martian gravity in between). The 4157 strain showed the opposite: the highest growth was at 1 g, and the lowest under simulated microgravity (17% decrease with respect to 1 g). In this case, and keeping in mind the caveat regarding different media used for 4157, a correlation was observed that the non-motile strain had less growth in simulated microgravity and most in 1 g, while the opposite was true for the semi-motile and motile strains. The observed higher yield in simulated microgravity with respect to 1 g of the 4157 strain also contradicts observations made on the same flight hardware (albeit in minimal media) in actual microgravity, where a 13 fold increase was observed in the spaceflight samples with respect to Earth controls [7]. If the increase in growth under simulated micro- and lunar gravities of the uropathogenic strains (AMG1 and AMG1 ∆rpoS) holds true in these environments, this may have a negative impact by increasing the likelihood of crewmembers developing UTIs, a problem frequently reported by astronauts [51]. Regarding the MICs, the uropathogenic AMG1 strain showed that lower concentrations of Ciprofloxacin, the most commonly used antibiotic against UTIs on Earth [43], were needed under the three simulated reduced gravities with respect to 1 g, despite the fact that these gravitational conditions yielded higher cell counts in the growth dynamics study. Significantly, it was observed that cultures grown in simulated lunar gravity needed twice the concentration of simulated micro and Martian gravities, but still less than 1 g. Similarly, the ∆rpoSstrain needed a lower concentration of antibiotics to inhibit growth under simulated microgravity with respect to the other three gravitational conditions. Finally, for the 4157 strain, the simulated lunar gravity cultures required the highest concentration of Gentamicin for growth to be inhibited: 18 mg/L, compared to 12 mg/L needed for the other three gravitational conditions.
