The low-nutrient environment combined with enhanced irradiation and microgravity may trigger changes in the molecular suite of microorganisms leading to increased virulence and resistance of microbes. Proteomic characterization of twoAspergillus fumigatusstrains, ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4, isolated from HEPA filter debris and cupola surface of the ISS, respectively, is presented, along with a comparison to experimentally established clinical isolates Af293 and CEA10. In-depth analysis highlights variations in the proteome of both ISS-isolated strains when compared to the clinical strains. Proteins that showed increased abundance in ISS isolates were overall involved in stress responses, and carbohydrate and secondary metabolism. Among the most abundant proteins were Pst2 and ArtA involved in oxidative stress response, PdcA and AcuE responsible for ethanol fermentation and glyoxylate cycle, respectively, TpcA, TpcF, and TpcK that are part of trypacidin biosynthetic pathway, and a toxin Asp-hemolysin. This report provides insight into possible molecular adaptation of filamentous fungi to the unique ISS environment. The International Space Station (ISS) is a man-made closed habitat that functions as a platform to study the impact of the distinct space environment, which includes enhanced irradiation and microgravity on humans1–7, animals8,9, plants10–14and microorganisms15–19. Most experiments conducted on board the ISS are precisely planned. Studied organisms are intentionally sent to the ISS to investigate the possible alterations in their physiology, using ground controls for comparison. However, one on-going ISS Microbial Observatory (ISS-MO) experiment focuses on studying hitchhikers that have followed humans and cargo aboard the ISS20. Thorough investigation of microbiological characteristics of closed habitats, like the ISS, are indispensable to National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), as manned long-term space flight missions are within reach. A deeper understanding of microbes that coexist in closed habitats with humans remains imperative to astronauts’ health and the overall maintenance of closed systems. Strict scrutiny of the microbiome and mycobiome of the ISS20–25, Mir26,27, and Skylab28, in the past, has revealed prevalence of fungal genera:Cladosporium,Penicillium, andAspergillusin space environments. These fungi can be both beneficial and detrimental to mankind, as they produce a myriad of commercially useful bioactive compounds29–34, while also causing allergies35, infections36,37and biodeterioration of habitats38–40.Aspergillus fumigatus, one of many fungal isolates identified in a recent ISS-MO study22, is a ubiquitous saprophytic fungus41. Its enormous adaptation capacity enables it to not only be omnipresent in the environment, but also to be a successful opportunistic pathogen42.A. fumigatuscauses variety of health conditions spanning from allergies to potentially life-threatening invasive aspergillosis (IA) in immunocompromised individuals43,44. Initial characterization of twoA. fumigatusISS-isolates, ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4, showed no outstanding differences in their genomes and secondary metabolites profiles when compared to clinical isolates CEA10 and Af293, however both isolates were significantly more lethal in a larval zebra fish model of IA45. Considering thatA. fumigatusbecomes more virulent in space and therefore potentially more dangerous to astronauts’ health, it was pertinent to further investigate molecular changes of ISS-isolated strains. Presented in this study are the unique differences observed in proteome of two ISS-isolatedA. fumigatusstrains, ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4, when compared to Af293 and CEA10. The goal of this study was to understand if the distinct environment of the ISS (low-nutrients, enhanced irradiation and microgravity) alters the proteome ofA. fumigatus. Due to an existing gap in our understanding of how filamentous fungi molecularly adapt to space conditions, proteome investigation of these two ISS-isolatedA. fumigatusstrains was prudent. 2.1. Isolation and identification ofA. fumigatus. Procedures to isolate and identifyA. fumigatuscollected from the ISS were described previously45. In brief, HEPA filter associated particulates were scraped, resuspended in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4) and spread onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates22. Cupola surfaces were sampled with sterile polyester wipes assembled at Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) prior to space flight. After each sampling event on board the ISS, wipes were returned to JPL for subsequent processing. During that process, two of multiple isolates were identified via ITS region and subsequently whole genome sequencing (WGS) asA. fumigatus. Mycelia and spores from GMM agar plates were collected. The hyphae from the liquid media were collected on Whatman paper filter and washed with cell culture grade water. All samples were stored at −80 °C prior to protein extraction. The lysis buffer consisted of 100 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB) with 1:100 Halt Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) and 200 μg phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The hyphae from the liquid media were first homogenized on ice using a Polytron (Kinematica AG, Bohemia, NY) with a speed setting of 5 for 3–5 times (1 min/time, 30 sec pause). Subsequently, the crude homogenates were subjected to a Precellys 24 homogenizer (Bertin, Rockville, MD) in which each sample was processed inside a 2 mL cryotube with 0.5 mm glass beads three times (at 4 °C, 6500 rpm, 1 min., repeated 3 times with 15 sec pauses in between). Mycelia from GMM were homogenized directly by bead beating due to their small volume. The lysed fungi were centrifuged at 17,000 g for 15 min. Protein concentrations in the supernatants were measured by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. Hercules, CA). 2.4. Tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling. 200 μg proteins from each group were TCA-precipitated. Obtained protein pellets were washed with ice-cold acetone, and resolubilized in 25 μL TEAB (100 mM) and 25 μL 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE). Subsequently, proteins were reduced with tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP, 500 mM), alkylated with iodoacetamide (IAA) and digested overnight using mass spec grade trypsin/lysC (Promega, Madison, WI) at 37°C. The digested peptides were quantified using the Pierce Quantitative Colorimetric Peptide Assay (Thermo Scientific). 40 μg of peptides from each specific sample was labeled with the Thermo Scientific TMTsixplex Isobaric Mass Tagging Kit (Af293 with TMT6-126, CEA10 with TMT6-127, ISSFT-021 with TMT6-128, and IF1SW-F4 with TMT6-130) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The TMT6-131 label was used as a reference that contained an equal amount of peptides from each of the samples. All labeled-peptide mixtures were combined into a single tube, mixed, and fractionated into eight fractions using the Thermo Scientific Pierce High pH Reversed-Phase Peptide Fractionation Kit. The fractionated samples were dried using a SpeedVac concentrator and re-suspended in 1% (v/v) formic acid prior to LC-MS/MS analysis. An Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer with the Thermo EASY-nLC ion source, 75 μm × 2 cm Acclaim PepMap100 C18 trapping column, and 75 μm × 25 cm PepMap RSLC C18 analytical column was used to analyze the samples. Peptides were eluted at 45°C with a flow rate of 300 nL/min over a 110 min gradient, from 3–30% solvent B (100 min), 30–50% solvent B (3 min), 50–90% solvent B (2 min), and 90% solvent B (2 min). The solvent A was 0.1% formic acid in water and the solvent B was 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. The full MS survey scan (m/z 400–1500) was acquired at a resolution of 120,000 and an automatic gain control (AGC) target of 2×105in the Orbitrap with the 50 ms maximum injection time for MS scans. Monoisotopic precursor ions were selected for fragmentation with charge states 2–7, within a ±10 ppm mass window, using a 70 s dynamic exclusion function. MS2scans (m/z 400–2000) were performed using the linear ion trap with the 35% CID collision energy. The ion trap scan rate was set to “rapid”, with an AGC target of 4×103, and a maximum injection time of 150 ms. Subsequently, ten fragment ions from each MS2experiment were subjected to an MS3experiment. The MS3scan (m/z 100–500) generated the TMT reporter ions in the linear ion trap using HCD at a 55% collision energy, a rapid scan rate and an AGC target of 5×103, and a maximum injection time of 250 ms. 2.6. Proteome data processing. 3.1. Proteome analysis overview. F1. AspGD GO Slim terms of proteins differentially expressed in space strains when compared to Af293 and CEA10. Differentially expressed proteins in ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4 are categorized into GO Slim categories using AspGD. Categories containing at least 2 up- or down-regulated proteins are presented. 3.2. Secondary metabolism and toxins. Proteins involved in secondary metabolism and toxin biosynthesis that revealed increased or decreased abundance Log2 fold change of CEA10, ISSFT-021, and IF1SW-F4 compared to Af293 (P < 0.05) To confirm observed up-regulation of proteins involved in the trypacidin biosynthesis secondary metabolite profiles of the clinical and ISS isolates were acquired using high performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array detection-mass spectroscopy (HPL-DAD-MS) analysis. Examination of the production yields of monomethylsulochrin, the final intermediate in trypacidin biosynthesis, (trypacidin is not detectable until 7–8 days of growth50) showed ~600% and ~200% increased production in ISSFT-021 ad IF1SW-F4, respectively (Figure S-2). Additionally, proteome of clinical and ISS strains was examined in liquid CD and PD media and confirmed significant up-regulation of AspHS (Table S-4). Lastly, observed differences in sporulation capacity between the strains do not seem to be directly correlated with conidiaassociated protein expression levels (Figure S-3), suggesting that the observed variations are due to exposure to space environment rather than different growth rates. Proteins involved in stress response that revealed increased or decreased abundance Log2 fold change of CEA10, ISSFT-021, and IF1SW-F4 compared to Af293 (P < 0.05) 3.4. Carbohydrate metabolic processes. Proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism that revealed increased or decreased abundance Log2 fold change of CEA10, ISSFT-021, and IF1SW-F4 compared to Af293 (P < 0.05) The proteome ofA. fumigatushas been studied under various conditions, including short-67, and long-term hypoxia68, following exposure to antifungal agents like amphotericin B69, and voriconazole70, and during different developmental stages58. However, in this report we present unique proteome differences observed in the two ISS-isolated strains when compared to clinical isolates. To date, there is no report which elucidates the molecular response of filamentous fungi to the distinct environment of the ISS, despite previous reports of their presence on board of the ISS22and Mir27,71. In-depth understanding of alterations triggered in the proteome of omnipresentA. fumigatusremains imperative for astronauts’ health, as it is an opportunistic pathogen that affects individuals with impaired immune system functions41. Both ISS-isolatedA. fumigatusstrains displayed higher abundance of several proteins involved in trypacidin biosynthesis. Trypacidin is a potent mycotoxin produced byA. fumigatusconidia. It has been shown to have cytotoxic activity against A549 alveolar lung cells suggesting its importance during the infection76. Further, it has been reported thatA. fumigatusconidia with disrupted production of trypacidin exhibit higher susceptibility to macrophage clearance49. Increased abundance of proteins involved in biosynthesis of trypacidin in both ISS–isolated strains may be possible cause of the reported increased virulence in the larval zebra fish model of both ISS-isolated strains when compared to clinical isolates45. Moreover, emodin and questin, precursors of trypacidin, are pigmented anthraquinones that have been reported to have a protective effect against UV in other organisms (Xanthoria elegansandCetraria islandica) that produce these types of compounds50,77. It is therefore reasonable to assume that up-regulation of trypacidin production may be another adaptation to the enhanced irradiation environment of the ISS, however this hypothesis has to be validated by further experiments. One of the increased in abundance proteins in ISS-isolatedA. fumigatusstrains was Arp1, which is one of the six enzymes involved in the DHN-melanin production51–53. Arp1 disruption resulted in production of reddish pink conidia with induced C3 binding that led to phagocytosis and killing of conidial spores during infection51,52. Increased abundance of Arp1 protein may, therefore, be another cause of the previously reported increased virulence in the larval zebra fish model45. Additionally, higher AlbA abundance, involved in DHN-melanin production72, was observed in JSC-093350089A. nigerisolated from the ISS73. Seemingly, both ISS-isolated species,A. fumigatusandA. niger, responded with increased melanin production to enhanced irradiation on board of the ISS. This observation is in agreement with previous reports of increased melanin production in fungi isolated from high-radiation environments such as the Chernobyl Power Plant accident sites or “Evolution Canyon”74,75. However, because none of the other enzymes involved in the melanin biosynthesis showed increased abundance when compared to both clinical isolates simultaneously, further assessment of melanin production is necessary to definitively conclude its increased production under ISS conditions. Proteome analysis of both ISS-isolatedA. fumigatusstrains revealed altered levels of proteins involved in oxidative stress response. ArtA, a regulatory protein, was reported to be increased in abundance in response to incubation with H2O2, suggesting its importance in overcoming oxidative stress62. Pst2, which is also present inCandida albicansandSaccharomyces cerevisiae, was shown to be induced in response to oxidative stress83,84. Additionally, Pst2 was reported to be a post-translational modification target protein that is ubiquitinated under peroxide stress conditions inC. albicans85. Interestingly, such post-translational modifications play a role in several cellular processes in eukaryotes, including cell growth regulation and environmental adaptation, suggesting their importance in gaining survival advantage86. These data are in agreement with previous reports of induced oxidative stress response in humans, mice and yeast while in space87–91. Overall, increased abundance of proteins involved in oxidative stress response was also observed inAcinetobactersp. Ver3 when exposed to UV irradiation92and JSC-093350089A. niger73. Although increased abundance of several oxidative stress-correlated proteins was observed in this study, it was previously reported that ISS-isolated strains were more resistant than Af293 to H2O2exposure, but less resistant than CEA10, suggesting no adaptation45. Among the more abundant proteins in both ISS-isolated strains several were involved in carbohydrate metabolism. Malate synthase AcuE (AFUA_6G03540) is one of the three key enzymes involved in glyoxylate cycle63, which has been shown to be crucial for fungal growth on C2compounds and fatty acids as a sole carbon source93. In our earlier study it was documented that these two ISS-isolated strains significantly outgrew both clinical isolates45. Further, more abundant PdcA (AFUA_3G11070), a pyruvate decarboxylase, has been shown to be involved in ethanol fermentation60. These data therefore suggest possible adaptation ofA. fumigatusto low-nutrient environment of the ISS20,22, which is in agreement with changes observed in proteome ofA. fumigatusduring starvation94. Similarly, up-regulation of proteins involved in starvation response was observed in ISS-isolated JSC-093350089A. niger73. This study presents comparative proteomic analysis of two ISS-isolatedA. fumigatusstrains, ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4 when compared to clinically established isolates Af293 and CEA10. Such comparison has enabled the identification of possible adaptation responses to the unique microgravity environment of the ISS, which includes increased abundance of stress response related proteins, and modulation of proteins involved in carbohydrate and secondary metabolism. To our knowledge this is the first report that focused on studying the proteomic changes in filamentous fungus isolated from on board of the ISS. Complex analyses of possible molecular alterations triggered by microgravity and enhanced irradiation will be pertinent to the future long-term manned space flights, as such an understanding is crucial for astronauts’ health and biodeterioration of the closed habitat. The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE95partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD008517. Figure S-1.

The distinct ISS environment (enhanced radiation, microgravity and scarce nutrients) altersA. fumigatusproteome. When compared to clinical isolates CEA10 and Af293 the majority of up-regulated proteins are involved in carbohydrate and secondary metabolism, and oxidative stress response.
