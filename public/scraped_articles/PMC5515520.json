Major plant architectures have long been thought to be guided by gravity, including the directional growth of the primary root via auxin gradients that are then disturbed when roots deviate from the vertical as a gravity sensor. However, experiments on the International Space Station (ISS) now allow physical clarity with regard to any assumptions regarding the role of gravity in establishing fundamental root auxin distributions. We examined the spaceflight green fluorescent protein (GFP)-reporter gene expression in roots of transgenic lines ofArabidopsis thaliana: pDR5r::GFP, pTAA1::TAA1–GFP, pSCR::SCR–GFP to monitor auxin and pARR5::GFP to monitor cytokinin. Plants on the ISS were imaged live with the Light Microscopy Module (LMM), and compared with control plants imaged on the ground. Preserved spaceflight and ground control plants were examined post flight with confocal microscopy. Plants on orbit, growing in the absence of any physical reference to the terrestrial gravity vector, displayed typically “vertical” distribution of auxin in the primary root. This confirms that the establishment of the auxin-gradient system, the primary guide for gravity signaling in the root, is gravity independent. The cytokinin distribution in the root tip differs between spaceflight and the ground controls, suggesting spaceflight-induced features of root growth may be cytokinin related. The distribution of auxin in the gravity-sensing portion of the root is not dependent on gravity. Spaceflight appears benign to auxin and its role in the development of the primary root tip, whereas spaceflight may influence cytokinin-associated processes. Reverse Fountain model and DR5 distribution. (a) Reverse fountain model (after refs.13,14) shows the movement of auxin toward the tip of the root through the stele (red arrow), to be redirected in a symmetrical manner by polar transport (blue, then purple arrows) back toward the zone of elongation. Cell types are color-coded and labeled; (b) the distribution of pDR5r::GFP (green) in a typical, vertically grownArabidopsisroot counterstained with Calcofluor White to outline cell walls (blue). GFP, green fluorescent protein. We wished to know whether gravity has a direct physiologic role in establishing the auxin reverse fountain signaling system in primary roots. One of the major values of work on the ISS is the ability to remove unit gravity from growth conditions. This allows a comparison with earthbound experiments with, for example, agravitropic mutants that imply that gravity sensing can be decoupled from the auxin flow.16–19We usedArabidopsis thaliana(Arabidopsis) lines expressing gravity signaling fluorescent reporter genes to examine the distribution of auxin and cytokinin in the primary roots of plants grown in two experiments on the International Space Station (ISS). We used the auxin artificial AuxRE promoter construct (pDR5r::GFP)20as a gene expression level reporter of auxin levels throughout the root tip, especially in the central columella cells (C), and a Tryptophan Aminotransferase ofArabidopsisfusion (pTAA1::TAA1–GFP)21to monitor auxin production in the Quiescent Center cells (QC). We used a Scarecrow fusion (pSCR::SCR–GFP),22to monitor the scarecrow transcription factor, which has a regulatory role in auxin biosynthesis,11to monitor auxin-related signals in the endodermal layer and QC. We similarly monitored free-cytokinin levels in root tips using the Arabidopsis Response Regulator promoter (pARR5::GFP) reporter, which is similarly distributed as the GUS reporter with the same promoter (pARR5::GUS).23 Plant development and root morphology is different between the CARA and APEX03-2 experiments The CARA and the APEX03-2 experiments represent two very different approaches to conducting a plant experiment on the ISS, and the plants grown within these two distinct experiments exhibit distinct morphologies. Within each experiment, however, the environmental conditions between the spaceflight habitat and the ground control habitat were comparable. Experiment configuration and spaceflight-unique operations. The Petri plates of plants in CARA were grown in ambient lighting in the ISS on the interior wall of the Destiny module of the ISS (a), while the APEX03-2 experiment the plates were grown in the Vegetable Production System (VPS/Veggie) in the Columbus module of the ISS. The placement and scale of the VPS is provided inb; the expanded unit containing racks of APEX 10-cm2plates is shown inc. Photographs of each ground control (GC) or spaceflight (FLT) plate before insertion into the LMM or LMM-GIU: GC CARA (d), GC APEX-4d (e), GC APEX-8d (f), FLT CARA (g), FLT APEX-4d (h), FLT APEX-8d (i). d, days. The spaceflight distribution of DR5r::GFP was indistinguishable from that of vertically grown roots on the Earth in two separate spaceflight experiments Light Microscopy Module operations. The LMM is located in the Destiny Module of the ISS (a, red arrow). The Petri plate was photographed and mounted on the LMM Petri base (b, red arrow) before being inserted into the LMM (c, red arrow). The plate photograph was used to create a root map to guide the telemetric maneuvers to locate regions of interest on the Petri plates (d). The region of the plate shown inddefines the area capable of being viewed by the LMM; the red lines that telescope tobshows the approximate extent of this region on the plate mounted on the base. Thexandycoordinate map for the LMM microscope stage was overlaid on the photograph of the viewing area (d); the numbers on the periphery of the viewing area are thexandycoordinates that were used to maneuvering the motorized stage by the input of numerical values from the ground. The inset indshows the three-dimensional rendering of several focal planes collected from the pSCR::SCR–GFP root tip circled in the top right region of (d). GFP, green fluorescent protein; ISS, International Space Station; LMM, Light Microscopy Module. Distributions of two proteins associated with auxin signaling were also unchanged in spaceflight The distribution of cytokinin was different in spaceflight as compared with ground control roots It is well established that there are changes in root morphology and in the gene expression patterns ofArabidopsisplants grown in a spaceflight environment, and many of the differentially expressed genes are associated with auxin and cytokinin signaling.24,26–28However, global patterns of gene expression from whole roots24or whole seedlings26–28do not reveal changes that occur in individual cells. Here we employ GFP reporter gene systems that enable the visualization of gene expression within distinct cell types of the primary root tip providing cell-specific data that would otherwise be masked in a molecular study pooling all the cells of the root. Though widely used for characterizing auxin distribution, as a transcriptional reporter DR5r::GFP does have limitations in sensitivity and response time for reporting auxin locations and concentrations, and it does not reveal all aspects of auxin-responsive gene activity. The initial observations presented here could be extended greatly in future flights through the use of more sensitive and non-transcriptional auxin reporter systems. In addition, exploration of sites of auxin action away from the root tip, such as shoots, root flanks and junctions, as well as lateral roots, would provide valuable additional insights into the spaceflight influences on auxin roles in plants not experiencing unit gravity. Spaceflight launches and NASA experiment operational nomenclature The data presented here are taken from two independent experiments launched to the ISS. CARA (CharacterizingArabidopsisRoot Attractions) was launched on SpaceX mission CRS-3 on 18 April 2014. The cargo Dragon Capsule was carried by a Falcon 9 rocket launched from Complex 40, Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, FL, USA. CARA is also identified by the NASA operations nomenclature (OpNom) of “Petri Plants”, and was one of the ARK1 payloads flown by the Center for Advancement of Science in Space (CASIS) (http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/1064.html). APEX03-2 (Advanced Plant Experiment 03-2) was launched on SpaceX mission CRS-5 on 10 January 2015, also in a Dragon Capsule carried by a Falcon 9 rocket launched from Complex 40. APEX03-2 is also identified by NASA OpNom “TAGES-ISA” (TransgenicArabidopsisGene Expression System—Intracellular Signaling Architecture:http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/1059.html). Plant lines and plate preparations The laboratory preparations and launch conditions were identical for both CARA and APEX03-2. Dry, sterilizedArabidopsisseeds were planted aseptically on the surface of 10-cm2solid media plates comprised of 0.5% Phytagel/0.5× MS media, and then immediately wrapped in light-tight black cloth (Duvetyne, SeattleFabrics.com).24,25The wrapped plates were stored at temperatures between 4 and 10 °C until launch within a cold stowage bag nominally at 4 °C. The seeds remained dormant until removed from cold stowage and exposed to light at the initiation of the experiment on the ISS. Although the plates were kept refrigerated where possible, the dark treatment ensured dormancy even if the plates were to experience excursions into ambient temperatures. Plant growth conditions on the ISS and comparable ground controls CARA and APEX03-2 were distinctly different experiments, each with unique growth habitats and hardware. However, within each experiment, the environmental conditions of the respective habitats were carefully controlled such that the growth conditions on the ISS closely matched those of their respective ground controls. This was accomplished by running the ground controls discontinuously; a 24-h delay for CARA and a 48-h delay for APEX03-2. These delays enabled the telemetric collection of environmental data from the ISS, which were then used to program the ISS Environmental Simulation (ISSES) chamber at the Space Station Processing Facility at Kennedy Space Center (KSC). The ISSES chamber replicated the temperature, CO2levels and lighting that had been experienced by the spaceflight plants in the previous 24 h (or 48 h, respectively). In the APEX03-2 experiment, a four-day-old imaging plate containing pDR5r::GFP, pTAA1::TAA1–GFP and pSCR::SCR–GFP was harvested to RNAlater (Ambion, Grand Island, NY, USA), into Kennedy Space Center Fixation Tubes (KFTs). KFTs are spaceflight hardware providing three levels of liquid containment for fixing biological samples in space.24,44After collection, the loaded KFTs were stowed at −80° C in the MELFI freezer on the ISS; ground controls were also collected to KFTs, but were stowed in a standard −80 °C freezer. The samples were kept frozen until the samples were returned to the authors’ laboratory. The preserved plants were then imaged on the ground with a Leica TCS-SP5 confocal microscope (Mannheim, Germany) in the Cytometry Core at the Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research at the University of Florida. The roots were prepared by rinsing in distilled water for 2 min, and then either mounted directly in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) or counterstained with a 0.1% solution of Calcofluor White for 5 min. Calcofluor White staining was followed by a 5 min wash in distilled water and then mounting in Vectashield for imaging. The imaging parameters for confocal microcopy were kept identical between spaceflight and ground control samples within each genotype, although these parameters could vary among genotypes. For instance: pTAA1::TAA1–GFP, spaceflight and ground, was imaged with the following parameters: exposure 62, pinhole 69, zoom of 1, step size 2.98, line average 2, FC gain of 700 and offset at −3.0. pDR5r::GFP imaging parameters were identical to those used for pTAA1::TAA1–GFP, although the gain was increased for all pDR5r::GFP roots (for both spaceflight and ground) to 760. The 40× oil objective was used throughout, and the 488 laser was kept at 38%. Keeping the imaging parameters constant between spaceflight and ground control samples enabled clear comparisons of the same relative location within the spaceflight and ground roots. Image rendering and quantification This research was supported by NASA NNX12AN69G and CASIS GA-2013-104. The use of the LMM on the ISS required extensive cooperation within and among organizations, and simply would not have occurred without strong commitment by all parties to maximizing ISS utilization. We extend deep thanks to the members of the ISS, KSC and GRC teams who supported both the CARA and APEX operations. The LMM team, including astronauts Steve Swanson and Butch Wilmore, was key to the success of these studies. Additional analytical and microscopy support was provided by the Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research at UF. We especially thank the members of the UFSpaceplants lab, past and present; as all have made extensive and unselfish contributions to the spirit and logistics of this and every spaceflight experiment that the lab has been fortunate to conduct. This research was supported by grants NASA NNX12AN69G and CASIS GA-2013-104 to RJF and A-LP. The authors declare no conflict of interest.",
