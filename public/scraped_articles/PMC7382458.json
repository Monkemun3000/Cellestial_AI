  "content": "Sierra Nevada sweep: metagenomic measurements of bioaerosols vertically distributed across the troposphere Received 2020 Jan 6; Accepted 2020 Jul 8; Collection date 2020. Subject terms:Biological techniques, Microbiology, Environmental sciences Aerosols (mostly desert dust, black carbon and ocean spray) regularly disperse across the Pacific Ocean with springtime atmospheric winds – in fact, models suggest that as much as 64 Teragrams of Asian aerosols can be transported to North America annually1. Past studies have reported microorganisms co-transported with globally-dispersed aerosols, and that both DNA signatures and viable cells can be detected in air masses2–4. For example, thousands of taxonomic signatures were measured in springtime Asian dust plumes delivering free tropospheric bioaerosols to an alpine research station in central Oregon3. In a separate flight project surveying airborne microorganisms in the western region of the United States, several taxa were found to be enriched in the upper atmosphere, including bacterial familiesLachnospiraceae,RuminococcaceaeandErysipelotrichaceae2. Despite harsh conditions in the atmosphere, viable bacterial isolates were recovered from the same study2, includingBacillussp.,Micrococcussp.,Arthrobactersp. andStaphylococcussp. Sampling over the US Sierra Nevada mountain range. (a) Aircraft Bioaerosol Collector (ABC) onboard NASA’s C-20A aircraft. Air sampling line, flow valve, cascade impactor, and air flow meter shown on workbench; (b) June 20, 2018, view from C-20A window at lowest altitude sampled (10,000 ft) above the US Sierra Nevada mountain range with an aerosol haze visible on the horizon; (c) Flight pattern on June 20, 2018 based on GPS data, sampling for 30–40 min at 10,000 ft steps up to 40,000 ft; (d) Flight pattern on June 21, 2018 based on GPS data, sampling for 30–40 min starting at 40,000 ft and stepping down in 10,000 ft steps. Panels C and D were generated using Mathworks Matlab software, versions R2018 to R2019 (https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html), from the recorded flight path. To produce a baseline for assessing known system contaminants, we followed a previously described method2where pre-flight and post-flightground controlswere collected on the C-20A window plate, air probe inlet, and an exterior portion of the aircraft upstream of the sampling probe using a pre-wetted, DNA-free sterile applicator (Puritan cat #25-3306UTTFDNA). Swabs were stored in 5 mL of sterile deionized water within a 15 ml Falcon tube and kept at 4 °C until laboratory processing. To characterize contaminants inside the aircraft, a blank gelatinous filter was placed in a petri dish resting on the work bench and exposed to ambient aircraft cabin air during every filter exchange. These samples were reported ascabin controls. The surface of the bench holding the cascade sampler was also swabbed with a pre-wetted, DNA-free sterile applicator as an additionalcabin control. A total volume of 200 µl was utilized for DNA extraction from the 1 mL InnovaPrep concentrated sample. Each sample was extracted using the Qiagen AllPrep PowerViral DNA/RNA Kit (part number 28000, Hilden, Germany). Standard manufacturer’s protocols with bead beating were followed to extract DNA from each sample. Samples were eluted in 60 µL of elution buffer and quantitated using the ThermoFisher Qubit Fluorometer (Waltham, MA). The average concentration of flight samples and controls was approximately 14.9 pg/µL. The Illumina NextSeq500 was used for shotgun metagenomic sequencing with the Illumina NextSeq Series High Output Kit v2 (San Diego, CA), using 150 base pair, paired-end reads13. DNA libraries were prepared for sequencing using the Illumina Nextera Flex DNA Library Preparation Kit (part number 20018705). For each sample, approximately 400 pg was input into the kit and standard manufacturer protocols were followed. Quality, concentration, and fragment sizes of the completed libraries were assessed on the Agilent Tapestation 4200 (Santa Clara, CA). Libraries were normalized and pooled to 100–200 pM according to the Agilent Tapestation determined concentrations. The pooled library sample was quantitated using the ThermoFisher Qubit fluorimeter and denaturing steps were performed according to the manufacturer’s standard recommendations (Illumina). A concentration of 1% of Illumina’s standard positive control (PhiX) was added to the pooled libraries and 1.3 pM final library concentration was input into the Illumina NextSeq 500 instrument. Metagenomic sequences were analyzed using the Livermore Metagenomics Analysis Toolkit (LMAT), a metagenomic analysis pipeline that searches for taxonomic identifiers associated with k-mers in reference genome databases14,15. The database contains distinct species-level alignments for 4,863 bacteria; 4,189 viruses; 2,038 eukaryotes; and 279 archaea. Alpha diversity and differential abundance Alpha diversity refers to the diversity within an ecosystem. It is usually expressed by the number of species (i.e., species richness) in that ecosystem. Alpha (α) diversity was estimated for each sample and compared within altitudes across flight days. We quantified α-diversity using the Chao1 estimator18and the observed number of effective taxa (qNeff) weighted by each taxonomic proportion of DNA per sample19. Weights were chosen such thatqNeffcorresponded to the following transformations of commonly used diversity indices: observed richness (the number of taxa seen;0Neff), exponentiated Shannon index (both taxa richness and evenness;1Neff), and the reciprocal Simpson index (dominance and evenness of taxa;2Neff). A differential abundance analysis was performed for taxa at each altitude step using the ALDEx2 (v.1.16.0) R package17. Individual abundances for an identified taxon were transformed using the centered log-ratio (clr) method17,20. Transformed counts were then analyzed for differential abundances across altitudes steps using the aldex.glm() function. Finally,Pvalues for taxa were corrected for multiple tests using the Benjamini and Hochberg method21. Culture-based recovery and identification After sample concentration, 100 µL aliquots were spread onto Reasoner's 2A agar (R2A) plates and Trypticase soy agar (TSA) plates, wrapped in Parafilm (American National Can, Chicago, IL) and incubated in the dark at 25 °C for up to four weeks while monitoring signs of growth. Individual colonies were sub-cultured on R2A until isolated, and then cryopreserved with 10% sterile glycerol (Amresco, Solon, OH) and nutrient broth (Difco, Sparks, MD) at -80 °C. Bacterial colonies DNA extraction and 16S rRNA Sanger sequencing was done by GENEWIZ (South Planfield, NJ). Forward and reverse 16S rRNA sequences were merged and searched against the NCBI non-redundant database using BLASTn22. HYSPLIT back-trajectories23were obtained using reanalysis data on the READY website,https://www.ready.noaa.gov. Heights at the different sampling altitudes were used as input for starting points in the model. Atmospheric microbes are co-transported in aerosols that have a wide range of sizes24,25. We forecasted aerosol (forward) dispersal from the sampled locations using several modeling process assumptions. Since the typical lifetime of relatively small particles in the upper troposphere (e.g., 10 days for 9 μm particles26) is comparable to the analysis timescale of one week, our analysis does not require a detailed particle size distribution. First, the bioaerosols were assumed to be 1-μm aerodynamic diameter particles released at a constant rate along the sampling flight path. Our choice of a spatially and temporally uniform particle concentration matches the sampling resolution within the flight path. Second, the downwind time-integrated concentration of the released material was predicted using the Department of Energy, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, National Atmospheric Release Advisory Center (DOE LLNL NARAC) modeling system. Atmospheric Data Assimilation and Parameterization Techniques (ADAPT) / Lagrangian Operational Dispersion Integrator (LODI) models. The ADAPT model was initialized with 0.25 deg resolution Global Forecast Model fields27,28. Our modeling resolved North American near-surface influences up to seven days after flights with a 30.8 km horizontal resolution. Default ADAPT upper-tropospheric dispersion parameters were used: 0.01 m2·s−1and 0.25 m2·s−2for the vertical eddy diffusivity (Kz) and horizontal velocity variance (σu2= σv2), respectively, and, while reasonable for many situations, may underestimate the overall vertical atmospheric mixing during the seven day period. Non-precipitation atmospheric removal processes were accounted for by including both (a) gravitational settling and (b) an additional 0.003 m·s−1deposition velocity. We chose the latter value to reflect deposition to regions with significant vegetation29. In order to simplify the modeling effort, other known effects on aerosol lifetimes in the atmosphere, including highly convective conditions and additional emissions from the Earth’s surface were not considered. Finally, to make our forecasts more relevant to downwind human population centers, we estimated the “average” outdoor individual and population-level exposures. The individual exposure probability was calculated by multiplying (a) predicted near-surface outdoor aerosol concentrations by (b) an average adult breathing rate (respiratory second volume) of 2 × 10–4m3·s−130. The population-level exposure estimate was calculated by multiplying the individual exposure estimate by the population as reported in the LandScan 2015 High Resolution Global Population Database31. Visualization of sample clustering using multiple distance and similarity metrics.

The figure was generated in R (v.3.6.0)53using package ggplot2 (v.3.2.1)54. Alpha (α)-diversity for flight and ground samples at genus level resolution. α-diversity quantified as1Neffwith samples shown as circles. The area of each circle is proportional to the number of genus-resolved fragments in a sample. Violin plots show density of α-diversity, box plots show the first, second and third quartiles, and 1.5 times the interquartile range of each time point’s α-diversity sample distribution. Dark red diamonds represent the means. The figure was generated in R (v.3.6.0)53using package ggplot2 (v.3.2.1)54. Relative abundance of genera across altitudes on both sampling days. Samples from Filter A separated by day and collection altitude to examine shifts in relative abundance of genera.Achromobacter, Stenotrophomonas, Streptococcus,andDelftiawere among the top 12 most abundant taxa in both days.Bacterial genera that were not among the top 12 represented by light gray colored bars. In additional to bacterial and fungal taxa shown,Pinus koraiensisandPinus radiatawere also detected at 10,000 ft on the second flight day (June 21, 2018) but were not plotted for clarity. The figure was generated in R (v.3.6.0)53using package ggplot2 (v.3.2.1)54. Table1shows the taxonomic distinctions between samples, summarizing the five most abundant genera from each altitude and controls (depicting only Filter A samples for clarity). At 10,000 ft, the distribution of the top five genera was even (with abundances ranging from 30 to 9% on June 20, 2018; and 53% to 4% on June 21, 2018). At 40,000 ft, the top five taxa were dominated by a single genus (e.g.,Alcaligenes97% on June 20, 2018;Penicillium82% on June 21, 2018). The altitude where the taxonomic composition was most similar between the two days sampled was 30,000 ft where bothDelftiaandStreptococcuswere proportionally abundant. Top five most abundant genera at each altitude compared to pre-flight ground controls. Isolated bacterial colonies were identified by searching 16S Sanger sequences against the NCBI non-redundant database using BLASTn22. Table2summarizes the isolates.Bacilluswas the most prevalent genus identified, measured in 25% of flight samples and all control samples.StreptococcusandStreptomyceswere also identified from a 40,000 ft sample. Other bacteria found in controls were:Lysinibacillus sinduriensis,Methylorubrum zatmanii,Lysinibacillus sphaericus,Lysinibacillus acetophenoni,Pseudomonas syringae,Microvirgasp.,Methylorubrum populi, andCellulomonas cellasea. Viable microorganisms recovered from flight and control samples. *The number in brackets indicates number of isolates matching the genus and/or species. #Designates query lengths < 1,000 nt. $Query sequence had < 95% identity to database match. +Isolates from June 20, 2018 sampling only. ^Isolates from June 21, 2018 sampling only. &Control sample taken in lab July 2018. Separate, forward-modeling of air masses showed that a portion of flight-sampled bioaerosols, if undisturbed, could have exposed outdoor downwind populations over the next week (Fig.5). In this figure, the grey contours indicate the fraction of sampled material that would have been inhaled by an average outdoor person (individual exposure) had the material not been sampled (termed potential exposures). Darker colors indicate a larger potential exposure. Figure5a shows the sum of the potential exposures from all four samples (10,000 ft, 20,000 ft, 30,000 ft and 40,000 ft). Note that the exposure may not occur uniformly over the week period, but rather the exposure regions can change as the air mass travels downwind and is diluted, see Fig.5b,c. The predicted potential impact areas were highly dependent on altitude. For instance, most of the impacts in the first week were associated with air sampled at 10,000 ft while air sampled at 20,000 ft was associated with a small potential exposure region in NV (USA). No potential exposures were associated with the highest altitude samples (30,000 and 40,000 ft) during the first week. Overall, only a small fraction (3 × 10−8) of sampled particles would be expected to reach population centers across North America and be inhaled during the first week. The actual amount of material inhaled would be smaller than predicted here since (a) most people are indoors and (b) indoor individuals have lower exposure, relative to outdoor individuals, to outdoor-origin airborne particulates32,33. Aerosol dispersal predictions.

This image shows geographic distribution of potentially inhaled material (inhaled fraction of sample material per sq km). Panels were generated using Mathworks Matlab software, versions R2018 to R2019 (https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html), from the modelling described in the text. Underlying map data was provided by Google and INEGI and accessed through the Google Maps Platform API. With an aerobiology study flown into the upper troposphere, we detected changing microbial abundance with height above the Earth’s surface – our dataset was reliant upon a shotgun metagenomics approach analyzing samples acquired between 10,000 to 40,000 ft, on two consecutive summer days over the US Sierra Nevada mountain ranges. Controls were also sequenced as a baseline reference. This strategy was essential because contaminants can confuse signals from low biomass environments. We observed significant differences in microbial taxa from flight samples compared to control samples. The most abundant taxa identified in the flight samples were:Achromobacter, Alcaligenes, Delftia, Lachnoanaerobaculum, Mycobacterium, Penicillium, Prevotella, Pseudoperonospora, Stenotrophomonas, Streptococcus, Tetrahymena,andVeillonella. Alcaligenesis a genus of gram-negative, aerobic bacteria found mostly in the intestinal tracts of vertebrates, decaying materials, dairy products, water, and soil. It can cause opportunistic infections, including nosocomial sepsis.Alcaligenes faecalisis usually found in soil and water environments, and its abundance in atmospheric samples hints at a possible relationship with agriculture (e.g., wastewater, compost, feedlots34) considering the physical proximity of air sampled to the CA Central Valley with ~ 28,000 km2of irrigated farmlands. Up to 55% of dust deposition at alpine sites in the Sierra Nevada comes from the Central Valley35; thus, the air sampled in this study would be expected to contain agriculturally-produced bioaerosols. The proportional abundance ofStenotrophomonas maltophiliaidentify it as another candidate to examine for possible emanation from the Central Valley, considering the species is regularly found in plant rhizospheres, animals, croplands, and water sources36. Other noteworthy bacterial standouts in our atmospheric samples—part of the normal flora of the mouth and gastrointestinal tract in humans—wereDelftia acidovorans37,Lachnoanaerobaculum saburreum38,Prevotella,VeillonellaandStreptococcus. Wastewater treatment facilities could be a contributing source of these bioaerosols39.Mycobacteriumwas among the most abundant genera at 10,000 ft on the first sampling day; aerosolized nontuberculous mycobacteria can cause pulmonary disease40, but we did not produce viability information with DNA-based detections.Achromobacter xylosoxidansmay be the most clinically relevant species detected in our study (endogenous microbiota of the ear and gastrointestinal tract41); however, considering it was also measured in control samples, this detection may reflect contamination.Two fungal species detected among the most abundant taxa (PseudoperonosporaandPenicillium) are of particular note.Pseudoperonospora cubensisis a fungal pathogen with a wide geographical distribution that can infect produce including cantaloupe, cucumber, pumpkin, squash and watermelon42. Similarly,Penicillium aurantiogriseumfound in our dataset, can cause spoilage of various food products43. Viable bacteria measured in our study (e.g.,Bacillus zhangzhouensis,Bacillus pumilus) included some endospore formers resistant to extremes and frequently reported in other high altitude surveys2,3. Using high altitude balloons for collecting bioaerosols up to 125,000 ft (38 km), Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria isolates were recovered45. Ground-based simulations using the stratospheric isolates estimated that some bacteria could survive long-range transport in the atmosphere up to 140 days if shaded from direct sunlight45. It is therefore plausible that many other viable (but non-cultured) microorganisms can be identified in this metagenomics dataset. The long-range dispersal of viable bioaerosols may be critical to understanding agricultural and public health implications because the troposphere and lower stratosphere can enable microbial dispersal over geographic barriers3. Most knowledge in this emerging area of aerobiology comes from regional studies. Soybean rust, for instance, has been correlated with incoming dust storms46. Valley Fever outbreaks in the Southwest of US is thought to be caused by dust storms carrying a fungal pathogen,Coccidioides immitis47. Desert storms in sub-Saharan Africa have also been linked to outbreaks of a deadly bacterium,Neisseria meningitides,affecting 26 countries and more than 300 million people. This same region, also called“the Meningitis belt”47, is also prone to epidemics such as malaria. Interestingly, we measured a strong DNA signature ofTetrahymena(first flight day at 10,000 ft), a ciliated protozoan typically found in aquatic ecosystems. No previous aerobiology survey has detected airborne protozoa at such heights above the Earth’s boundary layer. Another unexpected DNA signal wasPinus(second flight day at 10,000 ft), suggesting the sampled air mass had recently passed over forested terrain in the US Sierra Nevada mountains – taken together with the back trajectory model at 10,000 ft, the result might demonstrate how orographic uplift connects regional surface emissions with the upper atmosphere.
