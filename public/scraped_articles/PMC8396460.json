Spaceflight causes cardiovascular changes due to microgravity-induced redistribution of body fluids and musculoskeletal unloading. Cardiac deconditioning and atrophy on Earth are associated with alteredTrp53and oxidative stress-related pathways, but the effects of spaceflight on cardiac changes at the molecular level are less understood. We tested the hypothesis that spaceflight alters the expression of key genes related to stress response pathways, which may contribute to cardiovascular deconditioning during extended spaceflight. Mice were exposed to spaceflight for 15 days or maintained on Earth (ground control). Ventricle tissue was harvested starting ~3 h post-landing. We measured expression of select genes implicated in oxidative stress pathways andTrp53signaling by quantitative PCR. Cardiac expression levels of 37 of 168 genes tested were altered after spaceflight. Spaceflight downregulated transcription factor,Nfe2l2 (Nrf2), upregulatedNox1and downregulatedPtgs2, suggesting a persistent increase in oxidative stress-related target genes. Spaceflight also substantially upregulatedCdkn1a(p21) and cell cycle/apoptosis-related geneMyc, and downregulated the inflammatory response geneTnf. There were no changes in apoptosis-related genes such asTrp53. Spaceflight altered the expression of genes regulating redox balance, cell cycle and senescence in cardiac tissue of mice. Thus, spaceflight may contribute to cardiac dysfunction due to oxidative stress. Responses to spaceflight include cardiovascular deficits, loss of bone and muscle mass, compromised immune function, chromosomal aberrations and metabolic changes [1,2,3]. With future lunar and interplanetary space missions, astronauts will stay in space for longer periods, presenting increased cardiovascular risk to the crew. Therefore, a better understanding of molecular mechanisms that mediate physiological responses to the space environment is needed. Entering into microgravity causes a cephalad shift of body fluids which leads to increased heart stroke volume, a rise in left ventricular end diastolic dimensions and a fluid shift between the vasculature and interstitium [4,5,6]. The fluid shift invokes compensatory endocrine and renal mechanisms [6]. These alterations can diminish the capability of the heart to cope with gravitational stress immediately after returning to Earth, leading to orthostatic intolerance, as previously documented in some astronauts [7]. Gravitational unloading in space also contributes to cardiovascular deconditioning [8], despite vigorous on-orbit exercise programs implemented on the International Space Station (ISS). Both spaceflight and head-down-tilt bed rest, a ground-based model for human spaceflight, can cause reduced plasma volume and left ventricular atrophy [9,10]. A reduction in myocardial interstitial fluid may contribute to lower myocardial mass following microgravity exposure [11]. In rodents, 14 days of spaceflight was reported to reduce cardiac myocyte size relative to ground controls, which is consistent with cardiac atrophy [12]. In contrast, spaceflight for one week did not affect cardiac mass [13], although it is possible that this period is too short to cause demonstrable cardiac atrophy. Hindlimb unloading (HU), a ground-based rodent model for simulating weightlessness, is reported to cause cardiac atrophy in some studies [14,15], but not in others [13], thus further work in this area is needed. In addition to gravitational unloading, long term habitation in space will expose astronauts to low doses of ionizing radiation, which may contribute to both cardiac and vascular changes in oxidative pathways leading to tissue dysfunction [16,17,18]. In fact, spaceflight can cause substantial changes in expression of genes and biomarkers related to metabolic and oxidative stress pathways in various tissues of both astronauts and animals [19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27]. The relative contributions of the various complex factors of habitation in space, including microgravity and ionizing radiation, to observed changes in oxidative stress-related pathways are not yet understood. Activation of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis signal transduction pathways are major stress responses important for defending against many physiological and environmental challenges, including tissue oxidative stress. Spaceflight can alter expression of various cell cycle arrest and apoptosis regulatory genes [28,29] including CDKN1A (also known as P21), a cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor that mediates cell cycle arrest via cyclin interactions and apoptosis via TRP53. In addition, CDKN1A/P21 is a negative regulator of tissue regeneration in mammals, and is known to interact with NFE2L2 (aka NRF2), a master transcriptional regulator of oxidative defense genes. Spaceflight elevatesCdkn1aexpression in bone tissue [30], liver and kidney [31] as well as cultured cells [29], implicating activation of CDKN1A as a pathway invoked in multiple tissues in response to the space environment. We hypothesized that spaceflight leads to activation of oxidative stress and cell cycle/apoptosis-related pathways in the heart. To begin to test this hypothesis, we used thematic PCR arrays to identify the changes in expression levels of genes related to oxidative stress and cell cycle/apoptosis (Trp53) signal transduction pathways in mice exposed to 15 days of spaceflight on the STS-131 space shuttle mission. Our gene expression findings in heart are novel and consistent with activation of several molecular pathways, including those related to oxidative stress, cell cycle regulation, inflammation and DNA damage repair, which ultimately may contribute to cardiac dysfunction during long duration spaceflight. 2.1. Body Mass of Animals Pre- and Post-Flight Schematic diagram of experiment design and workflow. 2.2. Spaceflight Altered Expression of Oxidative Stress Related Genes Normalized expression levels ofNfe2l2as measured by a separate RT-PCR assay. Each data point is shown. The middle lines indicate the geometric mean (normalized expression of 1 for Ground Control and 0.42 for Spaceflight group). Outer lines show the 95% confidence intervals. * Statistically significant by Mann–Whitney U test atp< 0.05, n = 4. The log2 (linear) normalized expression from the Ground Control and Flight groups were used in the Mann–Whitney U test. Spaceflight altered the expression of genes involved in oxidative stress pathway. Expression levels are represented as fold regulation in spaceflight versus ground controls (FLT versus GRD). Shown are 14 differentially regulated genes out of a panel of 84 genes related to the oxidative stress response as measured by RT-PCR. Of these, 11 were upregulated while three were downregulated. The change in expression levels of these genes were found to be statistically significant by Mann–Whitney U test atp< 0.05, n = 4. 2.3. Spaceflight Altered Expression of Cell Cycle/Proliferation Related Genes Spaceflight altered the expression of genes involved in theTrp53signaling pathway. Expression levels are represented as fold regulation in spaceflight versus ground controls (FLT versus GRD). Shown are 23 differentially regulated genes out of a panel of 84 genes related to theTrp53signaling pathways as assessed by RT-PCR. Out of these, 13 genes were upregulated and 10 genes were downregulated. The change in expression levels of these genes were found to be statistically significant by Mann–Whitney U test atp< 0.05, n = 4. 2.4. Gene Networks and Disease Predictions Whereas cardiovascular physiology has been studied intensively in astronauts, analysis of cardiac changes at the tissue level has been more limited [12,13,34,35,36]. Goldstein et al. [12] report that spaceflight (14 days) reduces the cross-sectional area of papillary cardiomyocytes in rats relative to ground controls, with ultrastructural changes consistent with cardiac atrophy. Short duration (6 days) spaceflight upregulates activity and mRNA expression of the mitochondrial enzyme, malate dehydrogenase in rat hearts, and displays a pattern of mitochondrial gene expression changes discrete from those in skeletal muscle [34]. More recently, long duration spaceflight (37 days) was shown to alter expression of methylation-related genes in the heart of adult mice, but not cytoskeletal protein levels. Interestingly, lifetime exposure ofDrosophilato microgravity leads to diminished cardiac size, cardiac dysfunction, altered remodeling, and proteosomal abnormalities [36]. Furthermore, spaceflight causes cardiac progenitor cells in culture to display a gene expression profile consistent with early, stem-like function along with increased oxidative stress and re-entry into the cell cycle [37]. Thus, our study on expression levels of oxidative stress and cell cycle-related genes provides novel findings on how the heart responds to spaceflight at the tissue level. 3.1. Oxidative Stress-Related Gene Expression in Spaceflight Heart RT-PCR array data show that expression levels of 14 genes were significantly (p< 0.05) altered (11 upregulated and 3 downregulated) in FLT samples as compared to GRD controls. In addition, RT-PCR analysis forNfe2l2revealed lower levels in FLT mice than GRD.Nfe2l2is a master transcriptional regulator for oxidative stress response genes, and is rapidly transcribed within seconds following changes in the gravity vector [23]. Other tissues also display reducedNfe2l2expression levels in similar spaceflight experiments entailing tissue recovery after landing [38]. Suzuki et al. recently demonstrated that long duration spaceflight activatesNfe2l2-dependent oxidative stress pathways in several tissues of growing mice [39]. Furthermore,Nfe2l2-deficient mice are protected from spaceflight-induced oxidative stress-related genes and changes in body weight [39], and also display accelerated transition of muscle fiber type without protecting from atrophy [40]. Txnipwas upregulated 1.9-fold andFanccwas downregulated 1.6-fold in FLT compared to GRD, which also may contribute to a pro-oxidative milieu in the heart during spaceflight. TXNIP is a negative regulator of thioredoxins (TRXs) [50], which are potent antioxidants, and their downregulation by elevatedTxnipexpression in FLT samples may lead to increased oxidative stress in cardiac tissue. In cultured human endothelial cells (HUVEC),Txnipwas the most upregulated by spaceflight (33-fold) [51].Fancccodes for an antioxidant and its downregulation can cause sensitivity to oxidative stress-mediated damage to tissue [52]. Although the magnitude of differences between FLT and GRD for statistically significant genes were generally modest, together, the findings suggest that spaceflight activates a network of genes responsible for redox signaling and defense against oxidative stress in the heart. 3.2. Cell Cycle and Senescence-Related Gene Expression in Spaceflight Heart We found spaceflight increasedCdkn1a/p21 expression 6.8-fold in hearts compared to GRD, consistent with reports for other tissues including liver, kidney, bone and muscle [27,30,31].CDKN1A(also known as P21), is a potent CDK inhibitor and inhibits cell cycle progression at the G1 phase by inhibiting the activity of CDK2 or CDK4. Increases inp21levels in bone from mice in this spaceflight experiment spaceflight were previously associated with proliferative arrest in cultured osteoprogenitors [30]. However, the adult mammalian heart itself has limited regenerative ability. Adultp21levels in adult heart are thought to contribute to normal cell cycle arrest in differentiated cardiomyocytes, and there is evidence that cardiomyocytes can divide in the adult human heart [53], though it is unlikely that such a small sub-population (1.3% of total) [53] can account for our findings. More likely, the elevation inp21caused by spaceflight may contribute to cardiomyopathies [54] via other cellular processes such as DNA repair, autophagy [38,55,56] and senescence. Interestingly,Myc, a mitogenic transcription factor gene that promotes cardiac hypertrophy in response to Angiotensin II, was also highly upregulated in the spaceflight heart samples we studied, and its deleterious action can be rescued byp21re-expression inp21-null mice [57]. Finally, in newborn mammals,p21elevation might interfere with cardiomyocyte binucleation, an important heart growth mechanism during post-natal development [58]. PTTG1 (Pituitary tumor-transforming gene 1) regulates the cell cycle by inducing cyclin D3 and repressingp21expression [59]. Thus, a decrease inPttg1expression (2.4-fold) observed in FLT samples may contribute to the observed increase in expression ofp21in FLT samples. In addition to upregulation of cell cycle inhibitors, CDK’s and cyclins such asCdk1andCdk4were downregulated in FLT samples, implicating an overall cell cycle arrest in spaceflight samples. Thus, one of the crucial findings of our study is that spaceflight alters the expression levels of major cell cycle and cell growth regulators. As the samples analyzed consist predominantly (but not solely) of fully differentiated non-dividing cardiomyocytes, this suggests that spaceflight activatesp21- andMyc-related pathways to regulate cell growth, cardiomyocyte function, and potentially cardiomyopathy, although complex interactions such as these remain to be elucidated. 3.3. Apoptosis and DNA Damage Repair-Related Gene Expression in Spaceflight Hearts 3.4. Inflammatory Pathway Gene Expression in Spaceflight Heart 3.5. Gene Networks and Molecular Signatures of Disease Computational analysis revealed that changes in a subset of genes that were differentially expressed due to spaceflight were linked to disease, including immune suppression and impairments in glucose homeostasis, consistent with findings in astronauts [72,73]. In addition, a subset of the DEGs resulting from spaceflight were associated with cardiovascular pathologies such as atherosclerosis, cardiovascular decompensation, hypertensive disease and myocardial infarction. Cardiovascular decompensation and volumetric changes in blood flow were consistent with previous observations in crew members during flight [3,8,74]. In a previous study on a subset of ISS crewmembers, mean arterial pressures reportedly do not change significantly during spaceflight. However, cardiac output and stroke volume are increased in flight compared to the seated position on Earth (although comparable to the supine position on Earth) [3]. Thus, our findings were consistent with previous reports on astronauts indicating that spaceflight adversely affects cardiovascular health. Computational analyses also indicated that spaceflight led to altered regulation of molecular networks within the oxidative damage response and cell proliferation pathways. Our findings suggest that oxidative stress andTrp35signaling pathways were linked and that spaceflight alters gene interactions between these two pathways. Furthermore, transcription factorsFoxO3,Jun,Myc, andHif1awere predicted to mediate the interaction between these two pathways, making these genes promising targets for mitigating gene network changes in response to spaceflight.Cat,Cdkn1a,Cdk1andCdk4also were predicted to serve as central hubs of gene networks that are altered by spaceflight. Hence, these molecules may be potential targets for the development of countermeasures against spaceflight-induced tissue deficits. For extrapolation of findings from this murine study to humans, there is the inherent limitation of the difference in species as well as a potential influence of the specific strain and sex which were selected as subjects. Factors related to experimental protocol also important to consider when interpreting gene expression findings from this experiment include the fixed duration of the mission (15 days), sample recovery only after animals were returned to Earth (3+ hours after landing), and the fact that ground control animals were housed in flight-matched habitats but were not exposed to similar forces as the flight mice encountered during launch and landing. Therefore, observed changes in gene expression did not solely reflect changes observed during habitation in microgravity, but for rapidly responding genes, such asNfe2l2, also may reflect re-entry and re-adaptation to 1-gravity on Earth, however briefly. As the scope of our investigation focused on RT-PCR, additional studies are needed to elucidate how spaceflight-induced oxidative stress may mediate cell cycle/growth and function, to gain deeper insight into how the cardiovascular system responds to the space environment and recovers after return to Earth. Furthermore, because the heart consists of multiple cell types, including cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and macrophages, each with a discrete gene expression profile [53], future experiments could focus on spatial transcriptomics to determine the cellular source of specific gene expression changes, as well as the regulation of protein expression together with cardiac function. All animal procedures were conducted in accordance with guidelines described by the National Institute of Health Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and approved by all relevant committees, including the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Ames Research Center. The IACUC approval number associated with this animal study was NAS-10-002-Y1. The mice in this study were flown on the Space Shuttle Discovery during the STS-131 mission for the experiment “Mouse Antigen-Specific CD4+ T Cell Priming and Memory Response during Spaceflight”. The heart tissue used in this experiment was an award to E. Almeida as part of the NASA STS-131 Mouse Immunology I Biospecimen Sharing Program (BSP). Female C57BL/6J mice were acclimatized to spaceflight food bars and lixits, but were not placed in Animal Enclosure Module (AEM) habitats until just before spaceflight. Mice were divided into two groups: flight (FLT) and ground (GRD) control. The NASA AEM units are composed of a stainless-steel grid cage, fan blowers, a layered filter system, interior lamps, specialized food bars, and a water box. The AEM units are self-contained habitats that provide group housing with constant ad libitum access to food and water while also providing a waste management system that isolates the animals from their waste. FLT mice were launched at 14 weeks of age then flown in space for 15 days and were not subjected to any experimental procedures during spaceflight. Synchronous GRD control mice were also housed in AEMs, maintained in an orbital environmental simulator at Kennedy Space Center, and exposed to environmental conditions matched closely to those of FLT mice on the shuttle (temperature, light/dark cycle, humidity, and carbon dioxide levels). FLT and GRD control animals were weighed before flight and immediately after return and were subjected to veterinary examination prior to euthanasia. Food and water consumption of each group were measured upon recovery. Animals were euthanized at 16 weeks of age starting approximately 3 h after landing using isoflurane anesthesia followed by thoracotomy. Euthanasia and dissections proceeded at a pace of one mouse every 15–20 min. The heart was removed and major veins and feed arteries trimmed off. The hearts of four mice per group were bisected into the cephalic and caudal regions, and the caudal halves (ventricles) were frozen in liquid nitrogen for later analysis of gene expression (the remaining hearts from four mice per group were distributed to another BSP investigator). The frozen samples were transported on dry ice to NASA Ames Research Center and stored in liquid nitrogen until analysis. 4.3. RNA Isolation and cDNA Synthesis Total RNA was isolated from frozen heart tissue by homogenization and RNA extraction using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Tissue samples were homogenized in 1 mL of TRIzol reagent and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. After incubation, 0.2 mL of chloroform was added, the sample agitated vigorously for 30 s and then incubated for 2 min at room temperature. The mixture was then centrifuged at 12,000×gfor 15 min at 4 °C. Following centrifugation, the upper aqueous phases were separated and incubated with 0.5 mL of isopropanol for 10 min at room temperature. Samples were then centrifuged at 12,000×gfor 15 min at 4 °C and the RNA pellet was washed with 70% ethanol. The RNA pellet was dissolved in 100 μL of nuclease-free water and further purified using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA), per instructions. The quantities and qualities of purified RNA were determined by measuring absorbance at 260 nm and 280 nm using a NanoDrop 2000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA). RNA integrity was assessed by running RNA on 0.8% agarose formaldehyde-denaturing gel with ethidium bromide and further visualized by Fluor-S Multimager (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). All RNA samples were analyzed by thematic real time PCR arrays (for Oxidative Stress andp53-related pathways) or RT-PCR (forNfe2l2). Although whole transcriptome analysis would be valuable, samples are no longer available for additional analyses. 4.4. Quantitative Real-Time PCR Array An equal amount of RNA (1 μg) was used from FLT and GRD samples to synthesize cDNA using RT2PCR Array First Strand Kit (SABiosciences, Frederick, MD, USA). Real-time PCR was performed using the Oxidative Stress PCR Array (PAMM-065) andp53Signaling Pathway PCR Array (PAMM-027) according to the manufacturer’s protocol (SABiosciences, Frederick, MD, USA). Briefly, FLT and GRD cDNA samples were mixed with RT2SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix (SABiosciences, Frederick, MD, USA) and distributed across the 96-well plate array. Each of the 96-well plate arrays contained primers for 84 genes related to oxidative stress orp53signaling pathways and control housekeeping genes (HKG). PCR was performed in a thermal cycler (ABI 7500 Standard, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) with initial denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for one minute. FLT and GRD cDNA samples were also run on control RT2RNA QC PCR Array plates (PAMM-999) to test RNA quality, reverse transcription efficiency, PCR efficiency and genomic DNA contamination. cDNA was synthesized by using QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). Briefly, 1 μg of RNA sample was treated with gDNA Wipeout Buffer at 42 °C for 2 min then reverse-transcription was performed using Quantiscript RT Buffer and Quantiscript Reverse Transcriptase as per manufacturer’s instruction. The Real-Time PCR mixture was made using QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). Synthesized cDNA from the previous step was mixed with Quantiscript SYBR Green PCR Mix andNfe2l2primer mixture, per manufacturer’s protocol. Real-time PCR was performed in a thermal cycler (ABI 7500 Standard, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with initial activation at 95 °C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Ct values were retrieved by maintaining the same threshold among all the samples. 4.6. Data Analysis and Statistics For the Oxidative Stress PCR Array (PAMM-065) andp53Signaling Pathway PCR Array, relative expression levels of genes were calculated using the comparative threshold cycle method (ΔΔCt) with normalization to the average expression levels of five housekeeping genes (SABiosciences Data Analysis Software). FLT samples were compared to GRD controls using Mann–Whitney U Test usingp< 0.05 as the threshold of significance and sample size of n = 4 mice per group. ForNfe2l2RT-PCR of heart samples, the change in expression levels were calculated using the ΔΔCt method with Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase (Hprt) 1 as housekeeping gene. The log2 (linear) normalized expression from flight and ground control groups was used in the Mann–Whitney U test atp< 0.05, n = 4 mice per group. 4.7. Gene Network Predictions and Functional Analysis To generate predictions on potential protein interactions, statistically significant differentially expressed genes from both PCR arrays were entered into the String DB protein-protein interaction database [75]. Experimental evidence, databases, and co-expression were used as sources to generate protein interaction networks. The interaction score was set to a threshold of “medium” (0.400). In conclusion, our study revealed that spaceflight significantly altered cardiac expression of genes related to cell cycle/growth (notablyCdkn1a/p21, Cdk1,andMyc), inflammation (notablyTnf) and oxidative stress (notablyNfe2l2,Nox1, Ptgs2), which may contribute to cardiac dysfunction. These findings provide novel data suitable for developing testable hypotheses for further study. Identification of specific mechanisms and molecules responsible for excess ROS generation during spaceflight is of considerable interest, and may yield new therapeutic approaches.
