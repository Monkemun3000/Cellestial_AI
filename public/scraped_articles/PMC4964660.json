To view a copy of this license, visithttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ The human experience with spaceflight has shown that space exploration comes with various health risks1,2,3. As humans contemplate manned missions to Mars or prolonged habitation on the Moon, these health risks will rise as the duration of spaceflight increases and as travel goes beyond the Earth’s protective magnetosphere4,5. During such interplanetary travel, astronauts will be exposed to multiple sources of ionizing radiation, including galactic cosmic rays, solar particle events, and trapped radiation in the Van Allen belts. Protons are the most abundant type of radiation in space, while heavier high atomic number and energy (HZE) ions such as56Fe produce complex tissue damage to molecules such as DNA that challenges cellular repair and recovery6,7,8,9. Recent epidemiological studies have demonstrated increasing risk for cardiovascular disease resulting from ionizing radiation exposure10,11,12. However, these estimates are largely derived from low linear energy transfer (LET) radiation exposures such as X-rays or gamma rays, which have fundamentally different properties from charged HZE particles comprising the galactic cosmic rays. HZE ions, for example, produce greater adverse effects on cellular physiology through increased genetic alterations and perturbations to redox metabolism, leading to persistent elevations in oxidative stress13,14,15. Despite the potential to be more biologically damaging, the long-term effect of space radiation on cardiovascular health has received little attention16,17,18. Therefore, the primary purpose of the present study was to determine whether mortality rates due to cardiovascular disease (CVD) and other causes of death differ in (1) non-flight astronauts who never flew orbital missions in space, (2) astronauts who flew only in low Earth orbit (LEO), and (3) Apollo lunar astronauts, the only humans to have traveled outside of the Earth’s geomagnetic field and into deep space. A heightened risk for CVD among flight astronauts could be due to the direct effects of space radiation and weightlessness on the arterial vasculature. Using56Fe ion irradiation and hindlimb unloading (HU), a terrestrial rodent model that simulates the irradiation and musculoskeletal unloading that occurs during deep space travel19,20, the secondary purpose of this study was to determine whether simulated space radiation and weightlessness independently and jointly produce long-lasting vascular dysfunction that could lead to the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Group Characteristics and Proportional Mortality Rates Values are mean ± SE. *Significantly different from non-flight group, P ≤ 0.05;†significantly different from the low Earth orbit group, P ≤ 0.05. The proportional mortality rate due to CVD for all flight astronauts was not different from that in the non-flight astronauts (Fig. 1). However, when looking at the subgroup analysis the number of deaths due to CVD in Apollo lunar astronauts was almost five times greater than that in the non-flight astronauts (Fig. 1) and four times higher than in LEO astronauts. There were no differences between LEO and non-flight astronauts. All flight and non-flight astronauts that died from cardiovascular-related causes were male. *Significantly different from the US population 55–64 years of age at the time of death, P ≤ 0.05.†Significantly different from the non-flight astronaut group, P ≤ 0.05.‡Significantly different from the low Earth orbit astronaut group, P ≤ 0.1.

Animal and Vessel Characteristics Values are mean ± SE. There were no significant differences among groups, P > 0.05. There was a significant acetylcholine (ACh) dose by group interaction between the control (Con) and total body irradiated (TBI) groups and the Con and total body irradiated plus hindlimb unloaded (TBI+HU) groups (Fig. 2). The nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) reduced ACh-mediated vasodilation in all groups and abolished treatment-associated differences among groups (Fig. 3A). The combined NOS and cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition further decreased vasodilator responses with no differences among groups (Fig. 3B). There was no significant dose by group interaction for endothelium-independent vasodilation with Dea-NONOate among groups (Fig. 4). Values are mean ± SE.n= the number of animals studied. *Denotes significant dose by group interaction between groups, P ≤ 0.05; TBI and TBI+HU group responses are different from that of control (Con). Effects of HU, TBI, and TBI+HU on ACh-mediated vasodilator responses in the presence of (A) the NOS inhibitor L-NAME, and (B) L-NAME and the COX inhibitor indomethacin (Indo), in gastrocnemius muscle feed arteries. Values are mean ± SE.n= the number of animals studied. ACh-mediated vasodilator responses are not different among groups. Values are mean ± SE.n= the number of animals studied. Vasodilator responses are not different among groups. There were no differences in vasoconstriction mediated by KCl (Supplemental Fig. 1A) or phenylephrine (PE) (Supplemental Fig. 1B) among groups. Both active myogenic vasoconstriction (Supplemental Fig. 2A) and passive pressure-diameter responses (Supplemental Fig. 2B) were also not different among groups. Levels of the pro-oxidant protein xanthine oxidase (XO) were greater in gastrocnemius feed arteries (Fig. 5A) and coronary arteries (Fig. 5B) from TBI and TBI+HU mice, while endothelial NOS (eNOS), superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD-1) and NADPH oxidase-2 (NOX-2) protein content were not different among groups in gastrocnemius feed arteries (Supplemental Fig. 3) and coronary arteries (Supplemental Fig. 4).

Life on Earth is insulated from the harmful effects of galactic cosmic rays and solar particle events through particle deflection by the Earth’s magnetosphere and shielding by Earth’s atmosphere. With the exception of the Apollo lunar missions, manned spaceflight has taken place exclusively in LEO where atmospheric protection from space radiation is essentially absent, but protection by the Earth’s geomagnetic field is present. Under these conditions, it has been broadly assumed that missions in LEO or short excursions to the Moon would not increase the long-term risk for CVD among astronauts16,18. Using non-flight astronauts as a comparison group, the data show that this group had a mortality rate of approximately 9% due to CVD (Fig. 1). The mortality rate for CVD among all US flight astronauts, including both LEO and Apollo lunar astronauts, was not different than that in the non-flight astronauts. However, when considered as a separate group, the Apollo lunar astronauts, the only group of humans to have traveled outside of the Earth’s protective magnetosphere, demonstrate a higher mortality rate due to CVD compared to both the cohort of astronauts that did not travel into space, as well as astronauts who remained in LEO (Fig. 1). These data suggest that human travel into deep space may be more hazardous to cardiovascular health than previously estimated. The second unique feature of the present study is that it is the first to examine the long-term mortality risks of spaceflight in LEO and deep space. Exposure to charged particles comprising the galactic cosmic rays in deep space has the potential to elicit a number of complications in biological tissue. Recent work in rodents and cell culture has highlighted the potentially harmful effects of such exposures on the cardiovascular system20,27,28,29,30, which may translate to astronauts engaged in deep space expeditions. While traveling from LEO to the Moon and back, the Apollo lunar astronauts traversed regions of geomagnetically trapped electrons and protons known as the Van Allen belts and, depending on the duration of their mission and the specific activities in which they were engaged (e.g., lunar surface and intravehicular Command and Lunar Module activities), were continuously subjected to varying levels of high-energy cosmic rays31. Fortunately, there were no major solar particle events during any of the Apollo missions. The lunar astronauts also experienced a visual phenomenon of light flashes (~17/hour) when the spacecraft was dark, and tests indicated that the flashes were the result of HZE cosmic rays traversing the retina31,32. Interactions of the galactic cosmic rays with the spacecraft hull will have a large impact on the radiation exposure of astronauts. Charged particles traversing the hull or “shielding” of the ship will incur nuclear interactions that depend on the composition and thickness of the hull material. These interactions will result in fragmentation products and particles of reduced energy but higher LET that contribute to the radiation dose within the spacecraft. The average radiation dose for the seven deceased Apollo crew was 0.59 ± 0.15 cGy (range 0.18–1.14 cGy)31. If we assume representative shielding scenarios (10 g/cm2) for the Apollo Command Module and radiation quality factors drawn from the most recent International Commission on Radiological Protection33, then the average radiation dose from the galactic cosmic rays to the Apollo astronauts would be approximately 0.295 cGy, or roughly half the total dose during their lunar excursions9. Using similar assumptions, astronauts in LEO would receive 50–100 mSv over a 6–12 month stay, of which the galactic cosmic rays would account for approximately two-thirds of this total dose9. Thus, given their mean mission duration of 15.6 days, the deceased LEO astronauts would receive approximately 0.29 cGy, a galactic cosmic ray dose very similar to the Apollo lunar astronauts. Despite virtually identical estimates for galactic cosmic ray exposure, the mortality rate of LEO astronauts for CVD is significantly lower than in Apollo lunar astronauts. Furthermore, LEO astronauts do not exhibit significant differences in mortality compared to non-flight astronauts. Several factors may account for this apparent paradox. First, lunar and LEO galactic cosmic ray dose estimates were made using certain assumptions that are constantly being revised. For instance, if actual shielding levels for the Apollo missions were less than 10 g/cm2, calculated lunar galactic cosmic ray doses may be underestimates. Second, activities on the lunar surface and inside the lightly shielded Lunar Module may also include dose contributions from scattered albedo neutrons, which are relatively insignificant inside a spacecraft. And finally, lunar and deep space exposures will include dose contributions from less energetic and lighter particles. For astronauts in LEO, the relative contribution of particles with energies below the geomagnetic cutoff is lower since they will be deflected by the Earth’s magnetosphere. While it remains uncertain whether differences in absorbed dose profiles can account for the elevated lunar CVD mortality rates reported here, it is equally difficult to disregard this possibility. As a result, these findings highlight the potential adverse impact of charged particles and their unique microdosimetric properties on post-mitotic cellular structures responsible for maintaining longer-term cardiovascular health. The possibility of long-term degenerative effects of deep space travel on cardiovascular function has not been well described or substantiated. Only in the last decade, when multiple spacefaring nations and corporate entities have announced plans to embark on manned exploratory missions to Mars and prolonged habitation on the Moon, has biomedical research been directed towards identifying possible CVD risks associated with the deep space radiation environment. Consequently, there is limited information available on the effects of charged particle HZE radiation on the cardiovascular system. US Astronaut Mortality Rate Study This study consisted of two distinct populations, the deceased astronaut population and the deceased US National Population ages 55–64. A record of deceased US NASA astronauts through 2015 was obtained from NASA Johnson Space Center Lifetime Surveillance of Astronaut Health and NASA website (http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/astrobio_former.html). Records of other NASA-US Air Force astronauts in the X-15, X-20 and Manned Orbital Laboratory programs were obtained from program summaries37. Deceased US astronauts were further grouped into flight (including LEO and Apollo lunar subgroups) or non-flight astronaut samples based on their flight activities; this allowed cause of death comparisons between the flight and non-flight groups. Deceased flight astronauts (n= 43) flew on orbital missions as part of the Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, Apollo-Soyuz, Skylab and Space Shuttle programs and included pilots, mission commanders, mission specialists and payload specialists. Deceased flight astronauts were further subdivided into two groups, those having flown missions in low Earth orbit (LEO,n= 36) and those having flown missions beyond LEO as part of the Apollo lunar missions (n= 7). Astronauts that perished in the Apollo 1 and STS-51L Challenger accidents but had flown on previous missions (n= 6) were classified as flight astronauts. Those US astronauts that perished in the STS-107 Columbia accident were classified as flight astronauts since all achieved orbital flight. US Astronaut Non-Flight Comparison Sample The first comparison group consisted of deceased astronauts who never flew in space or flew only suborbital flights (n= 41). These individuals included astronauts that completed astronaut training but were never assigned to a specific mission, were assigned to a subsequently cancelled missions, died prior to flying their assigned mission, flew the NASA-US Air Force’s X-15 rocket-powered aircraft, or were designated to fly on the US Air Force’s X-20 Dyna-Soar space plane or Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL). Astronauts that flew the X-15 aircraft never attained orbital spaceflight, and individuals assigned to the X-20 Dyna-Soar and MOL never flew in space as part of these programs due to their cancelation. Of the thirty-one X-15, X-20 and MOL astronauts, nine subsequently flew orbital missions as part of the Apollo and Space Shuttle programs. Four of the nine are now deceased and included in the flight group; three are in the LEO group and one is in the Apollo lunar group. Astronauts who perished in the Apollo 1 and STS-51L Challenger accidents who were first-time flyers (n= 4) were categorized as non-flight astronauts for the purpose of this analysis due to not having achieved orbital flight. US National Population Comparison Sample Cause of death was determined from death certificates in all Apollo lunar astronauts, 97% of LEO astronauts, and 49% of non-flight astronauts. In cases where death certificates were not available for review, cause of death was obtained from official NASA biographical sketches (http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/), NASA’s Astronaut Fact Book, obituaries, and other biographical records. The specific cause of death for one LEO astronaut and 6 non-flight astronauts could not be determined from any of the above sources; these astronauts were not included in the analysis for a final sample of 42 flight astronauts and 35 non-flight astronauts. Cause of death was categorized into four main categories: Cardiovascular Disease, Cancer, Accident, and All Other Causes. Deaths due to heart failure, myocardial infarction, stroke, brain aneurysm, or blood clots were classified as CVD. Deaths attributed to any form of malignant neoplasms were categorized as cancer. Deaths due to unintentional injuries, including orbiter destruction and plane, automobile, motorcycle, boat and bicycle accidents, were categorized as accidents. Any other causes of death were designated in the All Other Causes category and included illnesses such as pneumonia and pancreatitis. All-cause and cause-specific mortality rates for the US general population 55–64 years old in 2013 were obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for Health Statistics21. All experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees at Florida State University, NASA and Brookhaven National Laboratory, conforming to the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH)Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals(Eighth edition, 2011). Forty-four male C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME), 16 weeks of age, were individually housed at the Brookhaven National Laboratory animal facility at Long Island, New York. Animals were maintained in a controlled environment (12:12 hour light-dark cycle, 24 ± 2 °C) and provided food and waterad libitum. Mice were randomized by body mass to one of four groups: control (Con,n= 11), hindlimb unloaded (HU,n= 11), total body irradiated (TBI,n= 11), and the combined TBI and HU (TBI+HU,n= 11). One week after the conclusion of the unloading treatment for the HU and TBI+HU groups, the mice in all four groups were shipped to Florida State University, individually housed in the animal vivarium under controlled environmental conditions (12:12 hour light-dark cycle, 24 ± 2 °C) and provided food and waterad libitum. Mice were exposed to a single dose of radiation consisting of 1 Gy of56Fe ions (600 MeV/nucleon, LET 150 keV/μm in water) at a dose rate of 10cGy/min at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory beamline at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Irradiation of TBI+HU mice took place 3 days after the initiation of hindlimb unloading while the animals remained unloaded. Sham-irradiated mice were handled in an identical fashion but were not irradiated (0 Gy). Experiments were conducted on 2 mice per day over a 5-wk period. These studies commenced after at least 6 months from the time the HU mice were released from the unloading treatment. Animals from each of the four groups were randomly selected for experimentation over the 5-wk experimental period, and one mouse from each group was studied every other experimental day. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (5%/O2) and euthanized by excision of the heart. Gastrocnemius muscle feed arteries running along the superficial white portion of the gastrocnemius muscles from the left and right hindlimbs were isolated and either cannulated and prepared forin vitroexperimentation or frozen in liquid N2and stored at −80 °C for determination of protein content as previously described20,38. Additionally, the left anterior descending artery and branches off this artery (~90–220 μm inner diameter) were dissected free of the surrounding myocardium, snap frozen in liquid N2and stored at −80 °C for determination of protein content. Evaluation of Vasomotor Properties In one set of studies, vasodilator responses of feed arteries to the endothelium-dependent vasodilator acetylcholine (ACh, 10−9–10−4M) and endothelium-independent vasodilator Dea-NONOate (10−9–10−4M) were assessed as previously described20,38. ACh-induced vasodilation was also evaluated following incubation with nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 10−5M) and following incubation with the combination of L-NAME with COX inhibitor indomethacin (10−5M) as previously reported20,38. Maximal diameter and medial wall thickness were determined after a 1-hr incubation period in calcium-free physiological saline buffer solution (PSS) with 10−4M sodium nitroprusside (SNP) to allow complete smooth muscle cell relaxation. In a second set of vessels, vasoconstrictor responses were assessed through non-receptor (KCl, 10–100 mM), myogenic (increasing intraluminal pressure from 0 cm H2O up to 140 cm H2O, in 20 cm H2O increments), and receptor [α1-adrenoreceptor agonist phenylephrine (PE, 10−9–10−4M)] mechanisms as previously described20,39. Passive pressure-diameter responses were recorded in a similar fashion to that of the active myogenic response after vessels were incubated in calcium-free PSS with 10−4M SNP for 1 hr. eNOS, SOD-1, XO and NOX-2 protein content in gastrocnemius feed arteries and coronary arteries were assessed via immunoblot analysis. Arteries were isolated, snap frozen and processed as previously described20,40. Primary antibody dilutions were as follows: eNOS (1:150, BD Transduction #610296), Cu/Zn SOD-1 (1:8000, Enzo Life Sciences ADI-SOD-100-F), XO (1:1000, Abcam #109235), NOX-2 (1:1000, Abcam #129068) and β-actin (1:2000, Cell Signaling #4967). Differences in loading were normalized by expressing all data as relative densitometry units of the protein of interest versus β-actin. Proportional mortality rates were calculated as the number of deaths from a particular cause divided by the total number of deaths for that particular group or sub-group. The significance of differences in cause-specific deaths between groups was assessed with Fisher’s exact probability test. Due to this test being considered extremely conservative41, a value of P ≤ 0.10 was considered statistically significant42,43. Differences in age at the time of death and other astronaut characteristics were assessed with a one-way ANOVA and Fisher LSD post-hoc tests. For the animal studies, a one-way ANOVA and Fisher LSD post-hoc tests were used to detect differences in body, tissue and vascular characteristics. Vasomotor responses were evaluated using repeated-measures ANOVAs to detect differences between experimental groups and drug doses or pressure changes. All values are presented as means ± SE. A value of P ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
