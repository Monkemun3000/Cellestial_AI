Human acclimation to these environments presents complex health effects, with acute and prolonged consequences in multiple tissues that may result in increased risk to crew health and performance during the mission (Afshinnekoo et al., 2020;Crucian et al., 2015; Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019;Grimm et al., 2016;Indo et al., 2016;Kononikhin et al., 2017;Wilson et al., 2018). With a high concentration of oxidizable, unsaturated lipids, low levels of antioxidant defenses, and high energy demand, the central nervous system (CNS) is particularly vulnerable to space stressors, with studies reporting behavioral deficits in spatial orientation, coordination, and locomotion, as well as cognition (Cekanaviciute et al., 2018;Clément et al., 2020,Salim, 2017,Friedman, 2011). Spanning over 60 years of research, the short-term impacts of spaceflight on the CNS have been investigated, but there is still insufficient data regarding its long-term health risks (Clément et al., 2020). Also, there are limitations to evaluating the impact of CNS damage in humans. Therefore, there is a need to leverage research approaches using animal models that would aid in cellular, molecular, and mechanistic understanding of CNS responses to spaceflight. Recent literature has established the fruit fly as a valuable model for understanding the effects of microgravity (μg), hypergravity, and radiation in the spaceflight environment (Hateley et al., 2016;Hosamani et al., 2016;Ikenaga et al., 1997;Marcu et al., 2011;Ogneva et al., 2016). With their small size, short generation time (~10 days), short lifespan (~60-80 days), large number of offspring, and low cost of rearing, flies mitigate many of the practical concerns stemming from performing long term, multigenerational studies in space. SFμg flies exhibit increased activity on ISS Flies exposed to microgravity conditions show behavioral and neuronal deficits, glial alterations, oxidative damage, and apoptosis Global omics analysis highlights spaceflight induced altered genes and proteins in the brain (A) Schematic showing transcriptomics and proteomics sample processing.

Persistent effects of exposure to spaceflight Deep space exploration will expose space travelers to several environmental challenges, thereby altering the homeostatic equilibrium of various physiological systems, including the CNS. Understanding the risks to CNS and identifying countermeasures to mitigate these risks in astronauts will be crucial to ensure the success of missions to the Moon and Mars. Using MVP, a fruit fly space habitat, we provide insights into spaceflight effects on the brain at the molecular, morphological, and behavioral levels. While AG by rotation of the spacecraft is being considered as a potential countermeasure to μg, there is a gap in our understanding of AG prescriptions required to ameliorate the health concerns during spaceflight (Clément, 2017;Clément and Traon, 2004;Mao et al., 2018a;Young, 1999). To address this knowledge gap, we utilized the MVP hardware featuring an inflight centrifuge that simulates Earth’s gravity on the ISS (SF1g). SF1g served two objectives: 1) assessment of the use of AG as a countermeasure; and 2) distinguishing the effects of μg from other spaceflight stressors, such as radiation. Similar increases in fly activity (Benguría et al., 1996) and mouse circling behavior (Ronca et al., 2019) in spaceflight conditions have been reported. Future improvements in the flight hardware might aid in quantifying individual fly activity, thus providing further insights into behavioral changes caused by gravity changes and the ability to test the effectiveness of countermeasures. This study integrates transcriptomic, proteomic, morphological, and behavioral analyses to investigate the effects of spaceflight onDrosophilaCNS both during and after return from spaceflight. Further, our study utilizes inflight centrifuge mimicking Earth 1g, as a control that allowed us to separate μg from the effects of other spaceflight environmental factors such as ionizing radiation. Additionally, the postflight acclimation to Earth’s conditions is relevant to understanding the sustained effects of spaceflight on the CNS. Our integrated approach suggests that oxidative stress during spaceflight leads to differential regulation of metabolic pathways, oxidative phosphorylation, and synaptic transmission resulting in neuronal deficits, glial changes, increased apoptosis, and behavioral impairments inDrosophila. Furthermore, this study indicates that μg is an important but not an exclusive environmental factor contributing to the neurobehavioral outcomes during long-term deep space missions. AG may provide a measure for short-term protection, but long-term solutions still need to be explored, especially for longduration missions in deep space. Earth’s magnetosphere partially protects against ionizing radiation from GCRs and solar particle events (SPE) in LEO, but beyond LEO, deep space irradiation will pose significant risks to crewmember health. Thus, along with AG, future countermeasure studies should target these pathways in model organisms that are amenable to large-scale screening in space. The opportunity to conduct spaceflight experiments is not only rare and expensive, but the logistical constraints of such studies also make them highly challenging to perform (Inokuchi et al., 2007;Rutter et al., 2020). For instance, the experiment launch and retrieval can be significantly altered due to weather or technical issues with the spacecraft, thus necessitating a flexible experimental design to achieve the intended science goals. In fact, our sample return was delayed from 31 days to 34 days due to weather-related issues. Another constraint of spaceflight studies is that retrieving exact age-matched flies is often not feasible. Some of the previous spaceflight studies have been conducted on mixed-age populations of flies from different generations (depending on the mission’s timeline). But with the MVP hardware, the astronauts could accommodate multiple timed inflight operations, including a 5.5-day egglay period (Figure S1C), thus ensuring that the retrieved flies were from the same generation and within a relatively close age range (11-17 days). Our strategy of testing randomly selected flies from this collection ensured that the average ages were similar and allowed for an unbiased comparison across groups of flies. Further, spaceflight experiments are severely limited by mass and volume. Therefore, the number of samples retrieved is limited by the capacity of the flight hardware. In this experiment, a large population of live flies were retrieved from the MVP hardware, allowing us to conduct the presented experiments. Additional flies would have allowed for longitudinal multi-omic profiling at the R+25 time point but were unavailable for this experiment. The current study, MVP-FLY-01 mission, was an important one-time validation flight for the MVP hardware to demonstrate its ability to supportDrosophilaresearch on the ISS. After its successful validation, as demonstrated by this experiment, this hardware will form the framework for multipleDrosophilaspaceflight investigations in the future.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS A. Spaceflight mission and Hardware Description B. Fly husbandry, loading the module, and development Thew1118wildtype line (Bloomington Stock Center) was used in this study. Thirty hours prior to launch, one-day-old virgin male (10) and female (25) fruit flies were loaded into the adult food cylinder 3 in each of the six MVP modules (F0 generation). The food cylinder was then immediately opened to adult fly chamber 2 (Figure S1B,C). The modules were then placed inside of a standard cargo transfer bag for launch. Prepared food cylinders were stored at 4°C for the duration of launch and ISS operations. Approximately 3.7 days (90 hrs) after launch, the payload was delivered to the ISS and the crew installed a food cylinder 2 inside the MVP module and opened the food cylinder 2 to adult fly chamber 2 (Mission day=5), giving flies access to the new food. Food cylinder 3 was closed at this time. This procedure was repeated for all MVP modules, and the modules were loaded into the previously installed MVP habitat hardware (Figure S1A) by the ISS crew. At this time, the six SF1g modules started spinning at 68 rpm to maintain 1g in spaceflight while the six SFμg modules were maintained at microgravity levels. After 5.5 days of egg laying (Mission Day=10), food cylinder 2 was opened to adult fly chamber 1 to allow the eggs laid in space to develop and emerge into adult flies in chamber 1. At the same time food cylinder 2 was closed to adult fly chamber 2, such that the launch populations of flies were prevented from entering food cylinder 2, thus keeping the generations separated (Figure S1C). Food cylinder 3 was reopened to adult fly chamber 2 to continue providing food to this population for the remainder of the experiment. The larvae and flies that emerged from the food cylinder 2 into the adult fly chamber 1 had undergone their entire developmental life cycle during spaceflight (F1 generation). At this time, food cylinder 1 was inserted and opened to chamber 1 to allow egg laying in cylinder 1, which will produce the second generation of spaceflight-developed flies (F2 generation). Food cylinder 2 remained open to chamber 1 during egg lay to allow adults to continue emerging. This also allowed us to know the age range of the adult flies returned for postflight experiments (~11-17-day adults). After 8 days of egg laying, food cylinder 1 from each module containing F2 generation fruit fly eggs and larvae, and some F1 generation adults, was fixed in RNAlater (Invitrogen). This allowed us to have samples that were fixed in RNAlater in space for “omics” analyses on the ground to track the progression of acclimation to spaceflight as animals develop in space under different gravity conditions. Following the fixation, a fresh food cylinder 1 was inserted and opened to chamber 1, and food cylinder 2 was closed. The MVP locker was powered down after the experiment, and fixed F1 generation flies and F2 generation eggs and larvae were placed in the MELFI-2 freezer at −80°C until the samples returned. Thus, this experimental design allowed us to freeze adult flies (F1 generation), larvae (F2 generation), and eggs (F2 generation) at Day 29. Postflight, we retrieved live adult flies (F1 generation), and eggs and larvae of F2 generation in the new food cylinder 1. All the science operations, including food cylinder changes and fixation and opening/closing of chambers, were performed by the ISS crew. Unforeseen weather conditions delayed the mission by 4 days, during which the crew repowered the MVP hardware on mission day 31 and powered it off on mission day 34 for return to Earth. A. Inflight behavioral analysis Climbing assay was performed on F1 generation of flies returned to Earth using a modified version of Le Bourg and Lints (Feany and Bender, 2000). For each condition, flies were sorted and collected by sex, in groups of ten per food vial (F=100, M=100) as soon as the live flight samples were returned on earth (i.e.,Fig. 1B, splash at L+34, 2 days for samples turnover (Long Beach, CA) and arrived at NASA ARC (R+0) and the assay was conducted. During the climbing assay, flies were transferred to a clean, empty vial and allowed to adjust for 1 minute. The flies were tapped down to the bottom, and the number of flies climbing past the 5 cm mark measured from the bottom of the vial in 18 seconds was recorded as a percentage of flies able to climb per vial (climbing ability). This assay was repeated three times for each vial, with a 30 second rest between trials. An average of three trials was reported per vial. Measurements from all three trials were averaged. The significance was determined between the conditions by a one-way ANOVA analysis with the condition as the independent variable. C. Immunohistochemistry and confocal imaging of brains F1 generation flies returned live were dissected (R+0 and R+25) and brains were immediately fixed for 20 minutes in PBS (Phosphate buffered saline) containing 4% paraformaldehyde, 6.7% sucrose, and 0.01% tween-20, and stored at 4°C in PBS with 0.05% sodium azide. The R+0 and R+25 brains were stained for immunohistochemical analysis (described below) where staining for different antibody markers was conducted at the same time to facilitate comparison and reduce variability. The brains were stained following a standard protocol (Iyer et al., 2018;Mhatre et al., 2014). Briefly, the fixed brains were washed with PBS and PBT (0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 10 min each, incubated with blocking buffer (5% normal goat serum (Catalog # 566380, Sigma) in PBT) for one hour, and then incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies. One set of brains were stained with anti-elav (1:100, Catalog # 7E8A10, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (DSHB), host species - rat) to label all the neurons, anti-cc3 (1:100, Catalog # 9661, Cell signaling Technology, host species - rabbit) as apoptotic marker, and anti-8-oxo-dG (1:100, Catalog # 4354-MC-050, R&D systems, host species - mouse) as the DNA oxidative damage marker. Another set of brains were stained with anti-Repo (1:50, Catalog # 8D12, DSHB), University of Iowa, host species - mouse) to label the glia, and anti-TH (1:300, Catalog # AB152, EMD Millipore, host species - rabbit) to label the dopaminergic neurons. These preparations were then washed three times with PBT for 10 min each, and incubated with fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies, Alexa fluor 568 goat anti-mouse (1:200; Catalog # A-11031, Invitrogen), Alexa fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit (1:200; Catalog # A-11034, Invitrogen), or Alexa fluor 633 goat anti-rat (1:200; Catalog # A21094, Invitrogen). Final washes were performed once with PBT and twice with PBS, each for 10 min, and mounted in Vectashield (Vector Labs, H-1000) for imaging. Stained brains were imaged using Zeiss LSM 880 laser scanning confocal microscope in the histology and microscopy core facility at the Gladstone Institute, University of California San Francisco (UCSF). The ELAV neuronal cortex, neuropil, and the total brain area were traced and quantified using Image J software (v1.52g, U. S. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA). This method is a gross measurement adapted from previously published papers (Chakraborty et al., 2011;Mhatre et al., 2014). The data reported here are the neuronal cortex and neuropil area normalized to the total brain area. Similarly, the number of puncta for TH (total number of TH-positive cells), repo, 8-oxo-dG, and CC3 were analyzed and quantified for each stain/marker using the cell counter in ImageJ software and are reported as absolute values. D. RNA isolation, sequencing, and analysis of fly heads The food cylinders that were frozen on ISS were slow-thawed at 4°C before opening. Once thawed, cylinders were opened, and flies (F1 generation frozen at L+29 days) were removed and sorted by sex. The head was removed using spring scissors and placed in RNAlater to preserve the RNA and protein integrity. Total RNA was extracted using RNA/Protein Purification plus (Norgen) from adult heads with four biological replicates in each condition (12-15 heads per replicate). This kit isolated total RNA and protein from the same samples. Isolated RNA was used to perform paired-end RNA sequencing on Illumina Novaseq 6000 platform, with an average of 20M reads of PE150 per sample (Novogene, Sacramento, CA). Data validation and quality control with FASTQC were conducted by Novogene, Inc. The standardized Genelab pipeline was used for the analysis (Overbey et al., 2021). Briefly, raw RNA sequences were trimmed using Trim Galore! v0.6.2 (Krueger, 2019), aligned to theDrosophilareference genome (Dmel release 6.08) and transcriptome with STAR Version 2.7.1a (Dobin et al., 2013), and read counts for each transcript were generated using RSEM v1.3.1. Differentially expressed gene lists were generated using a custom Genelab R script, GeneLab_DGE_noERCC.R, utilizing the DESeq2 v1.22.2 R package (Lai Polo et al., 2020). False discovery rate (adjusted p-value) corrections were performed using Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing adjustment, and the differentially expressed genes with an adjusted p-value of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. E. Proteomics and analysis of fly heads Proteins isolated from adult heads (F1 generation frozen at L+29 days) using the Norgen Biotek kit were used to determine the global proteomic changes. Three replicates in each condition (12-15 heads per replicate) were used for protein isolation and enzymatic digestion. Isolated protein samples were digested and desalted according to Lundby et al. (Lundby et al., 2012). Protein concentrations were then determined using a bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA) (Thermo-Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA). Proteins were then reduced, alkylated and subjected to acetone precipitation prior to digestion with endoproteinase Lys-C, 1:50 enzyme to protein (Wako, Richmond, VA). This was followed by digestion with trypsin, 1:50 enzyme to protein (Promega, Madison, WI), and desalting and concentrating using C18Sep-Pak cartridges (Waters). Peptides were mass tagged using Thermo-Fisher’s TMT 10-plex isobaric label kit (Catalog # 90061) following the included protocol and pooled for analysis. Six experimental conditions were labeled in triplicate across three TMT-runs, including two internal control channels. Basic Reversed-Phase Fractionation – Pooled TMT-labeled peptides were fractionated by basic pH reversed-phase (BPRP) fractionation on an Ultimate 3000 HPLC (Thermo Scientific) using an integrated fraction collector. Elution was performed using a 10-minute gradient of 0-20% solvent B followed by a 50-minute gradient of solvent B from 20-45% (Solvent A 5.0% Acetonitrile, 10mM ammonium bicarbonate pH 8.0, Solvent B 90.0% Acetonitrile, 10mM ammonium bicarbonate pH 8.0) on a Zorbax 300Extend-C18 column (Agilent) at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. A total of 24 fractions were collected at 37-second intervals in a looping fashion for 60 minutes then combined to produce 12 super fractions. Peptide elution was monitored at a wavelength of 220nm using a Dionex Ultimate 3000 variable wavelength detector (Thermo Scientific). Each fraction was then centrifuged to near dryness and desalted using C18Sep-Pak Cartridges followed again by centrifugation to near dryness and reconstitution with 20 ul of 5% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid. Liquid Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry- Mass spectral analysis was performed using an Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA). TMT analysis was performed using an MS3 multi-notch approach. The MS1 precursor selection range is from 400-1400 m/z at a resolution of 120K and automatic gain control (AGC) target of 2.0 x 105with a maximum injection time of 100 ms. Quadrupole isolation at 0.7 Th for MS2analysis using CID fragmentation in the linear ion trap with a collision energy of 35%. The AGC was set to 4.0 x 103with a maximum injection time of 150ms. The instrument was operated in a top-speed data-dependent mode with a most intense precursor priority with dynamic exclusion set to an exclusion duration of 60 seconds with a 10ppm tolerance. MS2 fragment ions were captured in the MS3 precursor population. These MS3 precursors were then isolated within a 2.5 Da window and subjected to high energy collision-induced dissociation (HCD) with a collision energy of 55%. The ions were then detected in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 60,000 with an AGC of 5.0 x 104and a maximum injection time of 150 ms. The data was then analyzed using SEQUEST (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA, version v.27, rev. 11.) and Proteome Discoverer (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA. version 2.1). Tandem mass spectra were extracted, and charge states were deconvoluted by Proteome Discoverer version 2.1. Assignment of MS/MS spectra was performed using SequestHT (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA, USA) by searching the data against a protein database, including all entries from the UniprotDrosophilaproteome (UniProt UP00000803, containing 21,041 sequences, download date 10-29-2019) combined with the common contaminants sequences from the Global Proteome Machine. Sequest searches were performed using a parent ion tolerance of 1.25 Da, fragment ion mass tolerance of 1.00005 Da, and requiring each peptides’ termini to have trypsin protease specificity while allowing up to two missed cleavages. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues (+57.02146 Da) was set as static modification, while TMT tags on peptide N termini/lysine residues (+229.162932 Da), acetylation of the protein Nterminus, and methionine oxidation (+15.99492 Da) was set as variable modification. Reporter Ions Quantifier settings were set to include unique and razor peptides, Quan value correction factors from manufacturer applied, co-isolation threshold 50%, average reporter S/N 10, and no normalization or scaling of the channels. The unscaled, non-normalized protein-level total reporter ion intensities derived from unique peptides were exported from Proteome Discoverer. Data quality assessment and control, normalization and analyses were performed using R v 4.0.1. Proteins underwent three filtering steps: 1) proteins containing missing values in any condition, 2) proteins with fewer than two unique peptide matches, and 3) proteins identified in only one or two out of the three runs were excluded from the quantitative analysis. Each TMT run was internally scaled, then transformed and analyzed together. Merged data were greatly affected by commonly seen batch effects associated to individual runs. Bioconductor package Limma v 3.44.3 was used to identify sexspecific abundance differences per protein in response to changing gravity conditions relative to ground/earth control by performing an empirical Bayes moderatedt-test accounting for the seen batch effect caused by each individual TMT run (Ritchie et al., 2015). Calculated p-values were corrected by Benjamini–Hochberg False Discovery Rate (FDR). Statistically significant difference was defined by an FDR cutoff of 0.05. F.
