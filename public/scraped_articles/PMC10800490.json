Perera,iperera@ncsu.edu Received 2023 Oct 7; Accepted 2023 Dec 12; Collection date 2023. Plant Signaling (PS) and Plant RNA Regulation (PRR) were two separate spaceflight experiments conducted on the International Space Station utilizing the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS). The EMCS provided a lighted environment for plant growth with centrifugal capabilities providing an onboard 1gcontrol. As an essential part of life support systems for long-duration space missions, plants supplement food as well as purify the air and water (Fu et al., 2016;De Micco et al., 2023). Future colonization efforts will require the ability to grow plants in unfamiliar environments. However, the space environment poses challenges to growing plants. In addition to the difficulties of providing essential requirements for plant growth (light, water, nutrients, etc.), growing plants in space requires the mitigation of unfavorable factors such as altered gas composition, lack of convective currents, and cosmic radiation. It is important to understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate plant adaptations to space. Toward that goal, several spaceflight experiments have examined the global transcriptional changes of plants grown on the International Space Station (ISS). One caveat to these studies is that until recently, lighted habitats for plant experimentation were limited; for ease of handling and setup, several experiments were carried out in Biological Research In Canisters hardware (BRICs), where plants were grown in the dark. Another point of concern is that many spaceflight experiments have employed hardware-matched experiments on Earth as controls; however, it is difficult to replicate all of the stresses that plants may face on the ISS on the ground. Further, while several transcriptional datasets have been generated (accessible through the NASA GeneLab data repository), differences in plant age, tissue type, and growth conditions confound efforts to separate primary responses to microgravity from other spaceflight related stress responses (Manzano et al., 2022;Olanrewaju et al., 2023). A recent meta-analysis by Barker et al. clearly illustrates some of these confounding effects (Barker et al., 2023). The authors showed that the analysis method (RNA-Seq vs. microarrays) was a principal factor leading to variability between datasets as was the hardware utilized for the spaceflight experiments. Nevertheless, focusing only on experiments conducted in BRIC hardware helped uncover common responses. Namely, oxidative stress, heat shock, cell wall dynamics, hypoxia, and ROS signaling were Gene Ontology annotations enriched in spaceflight compared to ground controls. A transcriptional profiling study of 12 day-old Arabidopsis seedlings grown in the Advanced Biological Research System (ABRS) hardware found organ-specific gene expression changes between leaves, hypocotyls, and roots (Paul et al., 2013). Although each tissue exhibited unique responses, cell wall remodeling, touch response, and pathogen responses were common themes among the genes differentially expressed in space. Plant growth is highly responsive to external cues. Two critical cues –light and gravity– have profound influences on the direction and magnitude of plant growth. Plant roots grow down with the gravity vector (positive gravitropism), while the stems grow opposite to the gravity vector (negative gravitropism) and toward light (positive phototropism). On earth, light and gravity work in combination to direct the orientation of the primary axes of growth as well as root and shoot branching and leaf angle, enabling efficient nutrient acquisition and light capture. The relative contribution of each of these cues in regulating plant growth is difficult to disentangle on Earth, where gravity is a constant; the ISS provides an ideal platform to answer such fundamental questions. The European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) was one of the controlled environment plant growth habitats operational on the ISS for many years (Brinckmann, 1999;Kittang et al., 2014). In addition to providing lighting, regulated air circulation, and ethylene scrubbing, the EMCS was unique in that it consisted of two centrifuge rotors within a growth chamber. Rotor speeds could be varied to impartglevels ranging from 0 - 2g. The EMCS, therefore, afforded researchers the ability to conduct a simultaneous 1gcontrol in space as well as to specifically query the effects of partial gravity. Spaceflight experiments utilizing EMCS hardware have attempted to uncouple light and gravity stimuli (Millar et al., 2010;Vandenbrink et al., 2016). Some experiments have examined the transcriptional response of plants to partialglevels. We previously reported that a subset of genes differentially expressed in microgravity respond to incremental increases inglevels (Sheppard et al., 2021). Other researchers have compared differences in gene expression between Lunar or Martian gravity and onboard 1gcontrols (Herranz et al., 2019;Villacampa et al., 2021). These types of experiments can inform us on plant responses to extraterrestrial habitats and will be important for aiding with long term colonization efforts. Prior to flight build, optimization was carried out at North Carolina State University with a focus on seed stock viability, experimental protocols, and downstream sample recovery and processing.Arabidopsis thalianaCol-0 seed stocks were carefully screened to obtain an average germination of ≥99%, and dissection and processing protocols were developed to recover ≥1μg RNA from ≤3mg input tissue with a high degree of RNA integrity. Seed storage tests were carried out to ensure the viability of sterilized seeds for at least a 6 month period. Preflight testing for Plant Signaling (PS) included a Schedule Test and Operations Verification Test (OVT) at the Norwegian User Support and Operations Center (N-USOC, Trondheim, Norway), in an Engineering Reference Module (ERM-1). Similarly, ahead of the Plant RNA Regulation (PRR) spaceflight, an Experiment Verification Test (EVT) at NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) in an EMCS ground facility (ERM-2), and an Operations Verification Test (OVT) in the EMCS Engineering Reference Module (ERM-1) at N-USOC were carried out. All preflight and flight preparations for seed, media, and hardware assembly were carried out at NASA ARC. 2.2. Flight experiment preparation PS and PRR were carried out in the EMCS using the experimental unique equipment (EUE)s which are the TROPI-like seed cassettes previously described (Kiss et al., 2009;Vandenbrink and Kiss, 2019). Whatman #3 blotter paper and black-gridded PES membrane (PALL life Sciences Cat. No. 65561) were cut to fit the seed cassettes. Blotter papers were pre-soaked in 0.5X MS media, pH 5.7 (without sucrose) and allowed to dry. Blotter papers and membranes were sterilized by autoclaving. Seeds were surface sterilized and allowed to dry for 2 hours. Healthy viable seeds were selected under a dissecting microscope and attached to the gridded membrane using guar gum. Seeds were positioned with micropyles pointing down (away from lights) with 27 seeds/membrane. Gridded seeded membranes were attached to prepared blotters with guar gum and fixed to cassette base plates. Cassette covers were installed and sealed with foil tape (3M). A total of 80 cassettes were prepared for each experiment. Seed cassettes were assembled for flight at NASA ARC and loaded into experimental containers (ECs) approximately 4 weeks prior to the scheduled flight. Onboard the ISS, ECs were loaded into the EMCS by the attending astronaut. Each EC contained 5 seed cassettes for a total of 4 ECs (20 seed cassettes)/centrifuge rotor. Experiments were initiated by hydration, controlled remotely. The experimental timelines for PS and PRR are shown inFigure 1. Both experiments were illuminated by white LEDs along the shoot side of the cassettes, and both experiments consisted of two replicate experimental runs. PS was carried out under continuous light, while PRR employed a long-day light regime (16h light/8h dark). Images were obtained from cameras located within the EMCS chamber. EMCS environmental parameters for PS were set at 21% O2and a constant seedling temperature of 24°C. For PS, the ambient cabin air was purged from the EMCS chamber prior to each experimental run so that CO2levels gradually increased to equilibrate with the cabin (beginning ~370 ppm and equilibrating to ~760 ppm). EMCS environmental parameters for PRR were set at 21% O2, 24°C daytime seedling temperature, and 21°C nighttime seedling temperature. Due to constraints with the upmass of air gas canisters, the EMCS chamber was not purged prior to each run of PRR; chamber CO2for the duration of PRR was similar to the ISS cabin (~3000 ppm). In both PS and PRR, environmental factors were monitored by real-time telemetry to record O2, CO2, seedling temperature, and relative humidity. At the end of the experiments, seed cassettes were removed from the ECs, with 1gcassettes handled first, and frozen immediately in the onboard -80°C freezer (MELFI). Seed cassettes remained frozen onboard the ISS. Samples were maintained at cryogenic temperature during return via Space-X Dragon, after splashdown, and until delivery to the laboratory. Samples were then stored at -80°C until processing for RNA. Experimental Timelines of Plant Signaling (PS) and Plant RNA Regulation (PRR). Seed cassettes were prepared with dry seed and installed into the EMCS hardware on board the ISS. Experiments were initiated by remote hydration (blue arrows), and the two rotors were actuated according to the schedule shown with regular imaging (black arrows). Plant signaling(A)employed a constant light schedule while Plant RNA Regulation(B)was conducted under a 16/8 hour light/dark schedule, with two staggered hydration events allowing for the simultaneous harvest of 4 day and 6 day old seedlings at the end of the experiment. 2.4. Ground reference controls For both PS and PRR, ground reference experiments were carried out in the ERM-2 at NASA-ARC, using flight build spares and matching environmental parameters to the flight experiments. Briefly, this hardware was designed to replicate environmental conditions experienced aboard the ISS to include temperature, gas composition, and provide comparable support to the flight hardware. Experimental containers (ECs) were positioned in the ERM in an upright position such that seedlings grew vertically, with lighting provided within each seed cassette from above the germinating seedlings, similar to the flight configuration. Each sample for Illumina Sequencing consisted of RNA isolated from a single seed cassette (each containing 27 seedlings) and each treatment/condition consisted of 3-4 replicates each. PS library preparation and sequencing were carried out by the Genomic Sciences Laboratory at North Carolina State University (Raleigh, NC) as described previously (Sheppard et al., 2021). Libraries were prepared using the ultra-directional library prep kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). Sequencing was carried out on 3 lanes of Illumina HiSeq2500 (125 bp single end reads). For PRR, Library preparation and Illumina sequencing for RNA and small RNA (sRNA) was carried out by Novogene Corporation Inc. (Sacramento, CA). 2.7. Data processing and analysis Raw reads were cleaned up to remove adapters and reads shorter than 50 reads by cutadapt (Martin, 2011). Quality control was evaluated by FastQC (Andrews, 2010) to ensure adapters were removed. Reads were aligned using HiSat2 (Kim et al., 2019) to the Arabidopsis genome using TAIR10 (Lamesch et al., 2012) and Araport11 (Cheng et al., 2017) genome annotations (downloaded 08/2018). Read counts per feature were generated using HTseq-Count (Anders et al., 2015). Differential gene expression was determined using DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014). Features with one count or less in any sample were discarded. Differentially expressed genes were filtered on p-values. For the individual analyses of PS and PRR, the significance cutoff was padj <0.05 and for the combined analyses, the cutoff was padj < 0.01. Each sample and condition was represented by 3-4 replicates. Normalized DESeq2 counts tables were visualized as heatmaps using the R package pheatmap (version 1.0.12), clustering by column and scaling by row. To determine whether overlap between individually analyzed PS and PRR DE gene lists were significant and non-random, hypergeometric distribution hypothesis testing was carried out using the phyper function of the R programming language. These analyses assumed a total genome size of 33,603 genes. Similarly, enrichment for HY5 targets in µgDEG lists obtained from the combined PS/PRR dataset was analyzed by the same function, assuming 3,894 putative HY5 binding targets within the genome (Lee et al., 2007). Gene Ontology (GO) annotation and enrichment was queried using agriGO2 (Tian et al., 2017), ExPath2.0 (Tseng et al., 2020), PANTHER18.0 (Thomas et al., 2022), and PlantGSAD (Ma et al., 2022). Raw sequence files and metadata for PS and PRR are available at the NASA data repository GeneLab under the accession numbers OSD-223 and OSD-437. 3.1. Experimental setup and growth parameters Representative Images of Plant Signaling and Plant RNA Regulation Seed Cassettes. Representative images of seedling morphology across µgand 1gconditions taken at the end of each experiment. Digital JPEGs are displayed directly as downlinked from EMCS hardware without alteration. Note that the camera configuration which allowed for close-up imaging provided two images of each seed cassette (left and right side), with partial overlap of each captured image (scale bar = 0.5 cm). 3.2. Differentially expressed genes The individual DE-Seq2 analyses of PS and PRR yielded a significant number of genes that were differentially expressed between microgravity (μg) and the onboard (1g) control. In total, we identified 1,819 and 1,792 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in PS, and PRR, respectively. The overlap between the two experiments for both μgupregulated and μgdownregulated DEG lists was significant (Table 1). Both experiments shared 178 genes upregulated in µgand 399 genes downregulated in µg. GO annotation revealed enrichment of the GO terms, “Regulation of Transcription” and “Auxin Signaling” in the common µgupregulated genes. “Cell Wall” and “Response to Stress” were GO terms enriched in the common µgdownregulated genes. Hypergeometric distribution hypothesis testing of overlap between DE genes identified by individual analysis of Plant Signaling (PS) and Plant RNA Regulation (PRR). GO enrichment analysis of genes differentially regulated in microgravity. 3.2.1. Genes upregulated in μg, compared to 1gin space 3.2.1.1. Transcription factors 3.2.1.2. Other transcriptional regulators Among the DEGs upregulated in μg, 7 genes with potential epigenetic regulatory function were noted. Of these, 5 genes encoded SET domain containing histone methyltransferases including 3 members of the SUVH family (Naumann et al., 2005). Genome wide methylation changes leading to altered transcriptional profiles have been reported in response to spaceflight (Zhou et al., 2019;Paul et al., 2021). Another conserved category that was prominent in the combined analysis is auxin transport and signaling (Table 3); this group includes 2 auxin efflux carriers (PIN3andPIN4), six auxin response factors (ARFs), and 11 small auxin upregulated (SAUR) genes. Auxin related genes up regulated in microgravity. SAURs were among the more highly upregulated genes in µg, with 9 of the 11 induced more than 2-fold.SAURs were first characterized as rapidly induced in response to auxin, although a fewSAURs are repressed by auxin (Ren and Gray, 2015). Of the 11SAURs identified in this dataset, 10 are induced by auxin;SAUR15andSAUR16may also be induced by Gibberellic acid (GA) and Brassinosteroids (Ren and Gray, 2015). SAURs 13-16 are classified as lirSAURs (Sun et al., 2016) that are light-regulated in cotyledons and hypocotyls and directly interact with phytochrome interacting factors (PIF)s (Dong et al., 2019). Overexpression ofSAUR36andSAUR41increases cell expansion and promotes hypocotyl elongation (Chae et al., 2012;Stamm and Kumar, 2013). SAUR36 is implicated in leaf growth senescence (Hou et al., 2013), and SAUR76 may act as a negative regulator of leaf expansion by regulating cell division (Markakis et al., 2013). SAUR15 is involved in the shade avoidance response and is a potential target of PIF4. Interestingly,SAUR15expression has been shown to increase on the lower flank of inflorescence stems 30 min following gravistimulation (Taniguchi et al., 2014). We also detected 6ARFs upregulated in µg. In general, ARFs are TFs that are bound by Aux/IAA repressors and remain inactive in the absence of auxin. This repression is relieved in the presence of auxin, promoting transcriptional activation of auxin-responsive downstream genes. Three of theARFs detected in this dataset (ARF1,ARF4andARF19) are implicated in leaf development, while ARF6 and ARF17 play a role in flowering (Cancé et al., 2022;Li et al., 2023). 3.2.1.4. Vesicle transport genes Interestingly, the combined analysis of genes enriched in µgidentified a third enriched group –genes involved vesicle-mediated transport– that was not detected in the individual analyses of each experiment. This category consists of approximately 50 genes, including those encoding for members of the coat protein (COP) complex, Sec23/24 protein transport, and several proteins associated with Golgi and the endomembrane system (Hwang and Robinson, 2009). The enrichment of vesicle transport is consistent with observation that shoot growth and developmental processes appear to be altered under µg. Not surprisingly, given the enrichment of biological processes described above involving vesicle transport, auxin responses, and transcriptional regulators, the cellular compartments overrepresented in the µgupregulated dataset are Golgi and the nucleus (Table 2). 3.2.1.5. Promoter analysis of genes upregulated in µg Consensus Sequence and Distribution of the Site II Element Enriched in Promoter Regions of Upregulated Transcripts.(A)Sequence analysis of the 500 bp region upstream of µgupregulated transcripts showed an enrichment for the motif identified as the Site II element.(B)Density analysis of the distribution of this motif within the analyzed region indicates a probability density maxima at -70bp relative to transcriptional start sites (right). The position of individual occurrences of this motif within the analyzed regions is plotted along the x-axis (blue dots), visualized with an artificial spread across the y-axis. 3.2.2. Genes downregulated in µg, compared to 1gin space The combined analysis of PS and PRR indicated that responses to stress (both abiotic and biotic) were highly enriched in genes downregulated in µg(Table 2), consistent with what was observed in each individual experiment. This overall dampening of stress response genes includes a downregulation of genes encoding several members of Cytochrome P450 family, 14 Glutathione S-transferases, and members of a MATE efflux family involved in detoxification. In addition, we detected an enrichment of plastid-associated genes as well as several involved in cell wall organization. 3.2.2.1. Transcription factors Functional comparison of transcription factors differentially expressed in microgravity. Differentially regulated transcription factor gene lists were analyzed for enrichment by PlantGSAD. Following GO enrichment, Singular Enrichment Analyses (SEA)s were compared by SEACOMPARE to identify common and/or unique GO categories using the online tool in PlantGSAD. The p values for GO categories were generated by the SEACOMPARE tool and represent the significance of the GO terms. The color progression from yellow to red represents increasing significance while the gray bars are not significant. The largest groups of TF downregulated in µgare 15 ethylene response factors (ERF)s and 12 WRKY TFs (Phukan et al., 2016). The WRKY TFs in our dataset appear to function chiefly in abiotic or biotic stress responses. The ERFs include 7 dehydration responsive element-binding (DREB) subfamily A members including CBF2, (Shinozaki and Yamaguchi-Shinozaki, 2000;Novillo et al., 2004) and 8 AP2/ERF family TFs (Srivastava and Kumar, 2019). The downregulated TF list also includes 4 heat stress TFs, several MYB and NAC family TFs, and calmodulin binding transcriptional activators (CAMTA)s. 3.2.2.2. Biotic stress and defense related genes Among the genes downregulated in µg, approximately 200 genes were associated with plant defense and response to biotic stimuli. This category includes 24 disease-resistance proteins, different classes of receptor-like protein kinases, and several WRKY TFs. Of interest, it has been reported that WRKY18, WRKY40 and WRKY60 (which are represented in our dataset) form a cluster that work either synergistically or antagonistically in response to bacterial or necrotrophic pathogens (Xu et al., 2006;Schön et al., 2013). 3.2.2.3. Abiotic stress related genes 3.2.2.4. Calcium signaling related genes Given the enhancement in stress responses, it is not surprising that approximately 40 genes involved in calcium signaling were downregulated in µg(Table 4). This category includes calcium binding proteins, calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPK)s, calmodulin-binding proteins and TFs, CBL-interacting protein kinases, and cyclic nucleotide gated ion channels (CNGC)s. Ca++related genes downregulated in microgravity. Natural antisense transcripts (NAT)s are antisense sequences which may overlap in part with protein coding (sense) transcripts. This sense-antisense pairing can lead to regulation of the sense transcript (Wight and Werner, 2013). A negative correlation in expression (i.e. NAT up and sense transcript down) may be indicative of gene silencing; however, NATs may also enhance sense transcript expression by regulating mRNA stability and/or translation (Reis and Poirier, 2021). 3.3. Microgravity versus the space environment Expression profiles of DEG subsets across 1g, µg, and ground control conditions. DESeq2 normalized counts (two replicates for each condition) of defense DEG subsets were visualized as heatmaps by the R package pheatmap. Data presented are clustered by column (dendrogram, top), and scaled by row. Expression profiles of DEG subsets across 1g, µg, and ground control conditions. DESeq2 normalized counts (two replicates for each condition) of salt stress DEG subsets were visualized as heatmaps by the R package pheatmap. Data presented are clustered by column (dendrogram, top), and scaled by row. 3.3.1. Micro RNAs detected and their target genes In addition to mRNA profiling, the PRR spaceflight experiment included sequencing of small RNAs (sRNA)s which revealed that several micro RNAs (miRNA)s were differentially regulated in µgcompared to 1gand ground controls. miRNAs act to regulate gene expression either by the cleavage of their target mRNAs, or by repression of translation or DNA methylation (Song et al., 2019). Differentially expressed miRNAs and their target genes.(A)Heatmap showing the expression of differentially regulated miRNAs.(B)Correlation of expression between miR863-5p and miR319c and their putative targets. Squares denote the miRNAs and circles represent the miRNA target genes. Red and green represent up and down regulation, respectively. We also observed that both µgand 1gseedlings had higher expression of miR398b-3p compared to ground control and 4 miR398b-3p target genes were coordinately downregulated in both µgand 1gcompared with ground, including two TFs,GTE11andATRX-like-protein. 3.3.2. Day 4 versus day 6: a possible interaction between µgresponses and development The experimental design of PRR with staggered hydration allowed for some samples to be initiated 48h later, yielding two time points (Day 4 and Day 6) from the same experiment. Our major focus was on DEGs detected at Day 6, described in the preceding sections. Comparing the effects of microgravity on the Day 4 and Day 6 plants revealed interactions between plant developmental stage and microgravity. These interactions are apparent in the PCA plot of the PRR Day 4 and 6 flight samples (Figure 8A). Principal component 1 primarily separated Day 4 and Day 6 samples under 1g(p<0.05). Principal component 2 separated 1gand µgat either day (p<0.001). However, there was little separation between the Day 4 and Day 6 samples in µgin the first principal component (Figure 8A). Comparison of Expression Profiles at Day 4 and Day 6.(A)Principal component analysis (PCA) of the PRR flight samples. Filled and open symbols represent µgand 1g, respectively (black circles, Day 4; red circles, Day 6).(B)Representative examples of individual genes that show similar patterns of expression between 1gand µg, at Day 4 and Day 6.(C)Representative examples of individual genes showing higher expression uniquely at Day 4 in 1g. DESeq2 normalized counts were visualized using ggplot2. Examination of the DEGs at Day 4 revealed that a much smaller fraction of genes were differentially regulated in µgat Day 4 (compared with the DEGs detected at Day 6). In total, at Day 4 there were 406 DEGs (75 up and 331 down in µgcompared to 1g). Many of these DEGs (~ 40% of the up- and 60% of downregulated genes in µg) at Day 4 were shared with the Day 6 data. A majority of the 210 genes commonly downregulated in µgat both Day 4 and Day 6, were related to abiotic and biotic stresses as described previously. This finding indicates that µgspecific downregulation of stress responses occurs as early as Day 4 and is common between the two times sampled. Genes associated with cell wall organization were also found to be downregulated at both days. Examples of genes which exhibit similar downregulation in microgravity at both Day 4 and 6 are depicted inFigure 8B. We also observed that several genes were uniquely downregulated in µgat Day 4 only. Scatter plots of representative genes in this group clearly indicate that the differential expression observed at Day 4 did not persist at Day 6 (Figure 8C). 4.1. Conserved and unique transcriptional changes in microgravity The PS and PRR spaceflight experiments were designed to examine early seedling development and responses to microgravity. To answer these questions, we utilized the EMCS facility with a rotor configuration selected to provide µgand an onboard 1gcontrol. The two experiments were conducted at different times and had different lighting regimes as well as some other differences in set up as outlined inFigure 1. Despite these differences, there was considerable parity between the DEGs in µgbetween the two experiments. Genes upregulated in µgcompared to the 1gcontrol were primarily involved in leaf and shoot development. The majority of the upregulated TFs function to regulate these processes and the enrichment in auxin and vesicle transport also support growth processes. In contrast, there appears to be a substantial downregulation of both biotic and abiotic stress responses in µg. Defense related genes were overrepresented and most of the downregulated TFs function in mediating plant stress responses (Figure 4). Additionally, we identified specific miRNAs that were differentially regulated in microgravity with coordinate regulation of their putative targets. The large-scale downregulation in microgravity of stress-response related genes in the PS and PRR flight experiments are somewhat at odds with other experiments where flight responses are compared to a ground control on Earth. In fact, we find that genes reported as upregulated in spaceflight appear to be downregulated in our datasets. For instance, 70 genes that were upregulated in spaceflight in BRIC19 (Choi et al., 2019) are downregulated in µgin our dataset. Many of these common genes are associated with response to stress and hypoxia. 4.1.1. Cell wall related genes Genes involved in remodeling of plant cell walls have been reported to be differentially expressed in previous spaceflight experiments (Paul et al., 2013;Kwon et al., 2015;Johnson et al., 2017;Choi et al., 2019;Nakashima et al., 2023). Glycomic analysis of spaceflight plant samples have shown changes in cell wall glycans, consistent with spaceflight related modification of cell walls (Johnson et al., 2017;Nakashima et al., 2023). Similar to these previous reports, we also observed that genes involved in cell wall modification are overrepresented in our datasets; particularly we found approximately 100 genes associated with cell wall organization and modification downregulated in µg. These included genes encoding for several members of the xyloglucan endotransglucosylase (XTH) family, expansins, peroxidases, pectin esterases and polygalacturonases. These cell wall proteins are involved in cell wall polymer rearrangement which occurs during cell elongation (Irshad et al., 2008). The individual genes in these enzyme categories however, were not conserved between our dataset and the previous reports; probably due to differences in tissue type, age and growth conditions. We also found cellulose synthase-like genes and 6 genes encoding for dirigent proteins which are involved in lignin biosynthesis to be downregulated in µg. 4.1.2. Chloroplast and photosynthesis related genes The mis-regulation or altered regulation of photosynthesis related genes has been reported for many spaceflight experiments including those that focused on seedlings grown in the dark (Kwon et al., 2015;Kruse et al., 2020). The investigators who conducted the EMCS experiments SG2 and SG3, (Vandenbrink et al., Herranz et al., and Villacampa et al.) reported that genes involved in photosynthesis were enriched in both µgupregulated and µgdownregulated datasets. We did not detect photosynthesis related genes upregulated in µgin either PS or PRR, perhaps due to the differences in the lighting regime compared with the SG series of experiments. However, we do see enrichment for genes involved in photosynthesis and plastid function downregulated in µg. Plastid localization was an enriched GO term for cellular localization accounting for approximately 300 genes in the µgdownregulated category of our dataset. Genes encoding for subunits of the NADPH complex, LHCA and photosystem I and II core were downregulated in µgin both PS and PRR. We also found that several of the µgdownregulated miRNA targets were associated with plastids. Since many of these spaceflight studies have focused on young Arabidopsis seedlings, it is not clear if the altered regulation of genes associated with photosynthesis and chloroplast function would persist in fully grown plants. Whether such adjustments continue to maturity and how they may impact the photosynthetic capacity of plants will need to be evaluated in future spaceflight experiments. Genes differentially expressed in µgin both PS and PRR were significantly enriched for HY5 target genes. HY5 is a central regulator of photomorphogenesis and may directly or indirectly affect the expression of approximately one third of the Arabidopsis genome (Lee et al., 2007;Gangappa and Botto, 2016). HY5 is involved in integrating light and hormonal signals to regulate developmental processes in plants. In addition to a major role in light mediated signaling, HY5 is implicated in nutrient uptake and utilization, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites and response to fluctuations in temperature (Xiao et al., 2021). HY5 targets were significantly enriched in the genes upregulated in µg(hypergeometric test,p=2.45e-11). The µgupregulated HY5 targets were associated with organ development, light responses and auxin transport. We also found a significant enrichment of HY5 targets in the genes downregulated in µg(hypergeometric test,p=1.698e-120). Many of the downregulated HY5 targets were involved in abiotic and biotic stress responses. 4.1.4. Gravitropism related genes Curiously, we found some gravitropism related genes to be upregulated in µg. Among these, the TF Shoot Gravitropism 5 (SGR5) was upregulated in µgat both Day 4 and Day 6. SGR5 was first described as being important for the gravitropic response of Arabidopsis inflorescence stems (Yamauchi et al., 1997). Further studies showed that SGR5 is localized in the shoot endodermis and that amyloplast sedimentation in the shoot endodermis is slower in thesgr5mutant (Morita et al., 2006;Tanimoto et al., 2008). SGR5 is also known as Indeterminate Domain 15 (IDD15). The IDD TFs IDD14, IDD15 and IDD16 have been shown to work cooperatively to regulate auxin transport in the shoot and play a role in aerial tissue development and gravitropic responses (Cui et al., 2013). We foundIDD14to be upregulated in µg, as well as another gene involved in regulating gravitropic response –LAZY1.LAZY1is expressed primarily in shoots of young seedlings and the early stages of the hypocotyl gravitropism were affected in alazy1mutant (Yoshihara and Spalding, 2017). The LAZY proteins are thought to act early in the gravity signaling cascade by transmitting positional information on amyloplast sedimentation upstream of auxin redistribution (Nishimura et al., 2023). The upregulation of these genes under µgmaybe related to their roles in regulating auxin flow; a closer look at their localization and dynamics under microgravity would be informative. 4.2. The Influence of developmental stage on observed transcriptional responses The differences in gene expression between µgand 1gat Day 4 and Day 6 in PRR, revealed that many more genes were responsive to µgat Day 6 than at Day 4. Since the Day 4 and Day 6 samples for each condition were obtained from the same rotor and collected at the same time, these differences suggest that the developmental stage of the seedlings can have a profound effect on observed transcriptional responses. The variation between Day 4 and Day 6 samples grown in 1gand µg, was also evident in the PCA plot where principal component 1, (which captured 53% of the variation between samples), clearly separated the Day 4 and Day 6 samples at 1g; however, this separation was not observed in samples grown under the µgcondition. This indicates that differences in gene expression between the Day 4 and Day 6 samples in 1gare either masked or not present in µg. A possible explanation for this observation is that there are differences between 1gand µggrown seedlings in their developmental progression. To determine if there were delays in germination between 1gand µgthat could result in altered development we examined germination time by interrogating the sequential series of images obtained throughout the PRR experiment. We found no difference in the timing of the first occurrence of radicle emergence between µgand 1gseedlings. We conclude that there was no delay in germination under µg; additionally, growth at Day 6 (Figure 3) was similar between µgand 1gconditions. Although we did not see gross differences in growth, given the short timeframe of this experiment, we cannot rule out that there may be subtle changes which could become more pronounced as the plants mature. Longer duration experiments with a finer resolution of time points would be required to fully characterize and understand the regulatory underpinnings for these differences. 4.3. Lessons learned for future spaceflight experiments 4.3.1. Long term plant experiments The PS and PRR experiments were focused on a narrow window of the Arabidopsis life cycle; the TROPI seed cassettes and EC arrangement only supported short duration experiments. Therefore we cannot extrapolate or assume that the transcriptional response to microgravity seen in these experiments would be universally applicable to long duration plant experiments on the ISS. Furthermore the seed cassettes provide a controlled optimal environment for seedling growth with sufficient lighting, moisture and humidity without inherent spaceflight associated limitations of water delivery that are manifest in larger plant growth habitats. Long term experiments where plants are grown from seed to maturity are needed to characterize critical stages in plant development. This approach will lead to a better understanding of the physiology of plant adaptations to the space environment. 4.3.3. Combined OMIC approaches We acknowledge that single-time-point studies are snapshots of “steady-state” transcriptional profiles which, on their own, are not sufficient to capture the full range and continuum of regulation. However, single-time-point transcriptional studies are valuable in that they can help identify key transcriptional regulators and they offer the first signs of pathways which may be altered. The inclusion of sRNA profiling in combination with RNA-Seq can provide clues on an additional layer of post transcriptional regulation and upcoming spaceflight experiments are likely to incorporate both these forms of analyses. While the proteome may be a more direct readout of response, spaceflight experiments frequently have insufficient amounts of tissue for large scale proteomic studies; additional hurdles include the cost and the paucity of well annotated reference protein databases. Only a few flight experiments to date, have taken a proteomic approach (Ferl et al., 2014;Mazars et al., 2014;Zhang et al., 2015;Kruse et al., 2020), and fewer still have been able to include both proteomic and transcriptomic analyses (Kruse et al., 2020). Moving forward it will be important to employ multiple OMICs approaches to study a spaceflight experiment. The larger plant habitats on the ISS such as Veggie and the Advanced Plant Habitat (APH) can better support these endeavors. Ultimately, the biochemical and metabolic status of the plants will be indicative of their adaptations to their new environment.
