  "content": "Comparative transcriptomics indicate changes in cell wall organization and stress response in seedlings during spaceflight Author for correspondence (jzkiss@uncg.edu) Plants will play an important role in the future of space exploration as part of bioregenerative life support. Thus, it is important to understand the effects of microgravity and spaceflight on gene expression in plant development. A common theme from our BRIC-16 space experiments and those of the other two groups was the downregulation of water stress response genes in spaceflight. In addition, all three studies found differential regulation of genes associated with cell wall remodeling and stress responses between spaceflight-grown and ground control plants. Spaceflight is potentially stressful for biological systems. Understanding this unique environment and its impact on gene regulation is a critical step in planning for long-duration spaceflight missions (Perbal, 2008;Vandenbrink and Kiss, 2016). In support of these exploration missions, bioregenerative life support systems will use plants as a source of food, fuel, and fiber for space explorers (Mitchell, 1994;Paradiso et al., 2013). However, environmental factors such as cosmic radiation, craft vibration, and microgravity (μg) can detrimentally influence plant development (Kranz, 1986;Mitchell, 1994). Morphological variances have been previously observed in spaceflight-grown plants relative to ground controls. These include decreased starch content and altered cell shape as a result of cell wall perturbation (Johnson et al., 2015), as well as more adventitious roots, waving of roots (Paul et al., 2012b) and a unidirectional skewing of shoots and roots (Millar et al., 2011). Consequently, the unique environment of spaceflight may negatively impact the yield of crops grown as part of the bioregenerative life support systems. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms by which plants respond to spaceflight, including alterations in gene expression, is critical for designing crops that can produce high yields in these unique environments. Unfortunately, comparative analyses among these transcriptomics experiments are limited due to differences in hardware, different genotypes, varying numbers of replicates, and different procedures for handling tissues (Paul et al., 2012b). However, despite these different approaches, there are some overlapping biochemical pathways that have been identified to be differentially regulated in spaceflight. These include pathways involved in heat shock, stress response, cell wall modification, and cell defense. Another study used the ABRS flight hardware, which is a different hardware system from the EMCS (Paul et al., 2012a,2013). These studies found that 408 transcripts were differentially regulated at least 1.9-fold and 58 that were at least 7-fold different in spaceflight compared with the ground control (P< 0.01). Each organ was found to have specific and unique responses to the spaceflight environment, which followed an overall change in morphology of the plant body including a change in cell wall architecture (Paul et al., 2013). In yet another hardware scenario, SIMbox, was flown in a joint Chinese and German experiment (Fengler et al., 2015;Li et al., 2017), and the hardware included a centrifuge to provide a 1gspaceflight control. In this project, 298 genes, with a highP-value (P< 0.1), were reported as differentially regulated 2-fold or more between space and ground control plants. Transcripts involved with cell defense response, pathogen-response, and pathogen-resistance genes were among the differentially expressed genes reported, along with calcium-signaling related MAP kinases and reactive oxygen species (Fengler et al., 2015). These experiments were entitled: Actin Regulation ofArabidopsisRoot Growth and Orientation During Space Flight (BRIC-16-Regulation;NASA, 2016b). Impact of Spaceflight onArabidopsis: Deep Sequencing and DNA Arrays as Collaborative Readouts of the Transcriptome ofArabidopsisSeedlings and Undifferentiated Cells in Space (BRIC-16-DNA;NASA, 2016c). Investigations of the Plant Cytoskeleton in Microgravity with Gene Profiling and Cytochemistry (BRIC-16-Cytoskeleton;NASA, 2016a). The purpose of the BRIC-16-Regulation (BRIC-16-Reg; E. Blancaflor, Principal Investigator) experiment was to compare microtubule development within the roots of wild-type and actin mutants inμg(Kwon et al., 2015;Nakashima et al., 2014). The wild type used in this experiment was Columbia (Col-0). This experiment found that there were more transcripts downregulated (148) than upregulated (26) at least 4-fold or more in spaceflight. Downregulated transcripts were mainly nuclear-encoded, while upregulated were mainly encoded in the plastid. The BRIC-16-Reg project focused on oxidative stress and cell wall structure in response toμg, as exhibited by the shorter root hairs present in spaceflight samples compared to ground controls (Kwon et al., 2015). BRIC-16-DNA (A.-L. Paul, Principal Investigator) studied gene expression profiles from seedlings and callus tissues (Paul et al., 2012b,2013;Zupanska et al., 2013). The wild type used in this experiment was Col-0. This experiment found that approximately 300 genes were differentially regulated more than 2-fold in whole seedlings, and another approximately 300 in tissue culture samples (P< 0.01). However, in the case of seedlings alone, only 45 were differentially regulated 5-fold or more in spaceflight vs. ground control. BRIC-16-DNA compared their work with other experiments conducted in parabolic and simulatedμgenvironments, and concluded that heat shock proteins (HSPs) were active only in prolonged spaceflight (Zupanska et al., 2013). In addition,Paul et al. (2012b)indicated that there were no differences in gross morphology between spaceflight-grown and ground control seedlings. Our BRIC-16-Cytoskeleton (BRIC-16-Cyt; J. Z. Kiss, Principal Investigator) studies focused on the structure of shoot statocytes and on the effects of spaceflight on plant gene expression. The wild type used in this study was Landsbergerecta(Ler-0). BRIC-16-Cyt reported a unidirectional skewing of roots and shoots was observed inμgcompared with ground control plants, and adventitious roots were present in greater abundance in the spaceflight samples (Millar et al., 2011). Additionally, morphometric measurements of the endodermal cells in petioles of seedlings demonstrated a significant change in endodermal cell shape. Cells were more rounded in spaceflight vs. ground control, which was likely due to cell wall structural differences due toμg(Johnson et al., 2015). All three of these BRIC-16 experiments were run simultaneously in the same flight hardware, with differences in sample preparation, and all three generated transcriptome data using microarrays. BRIC-16-Reg and BRIC-16-DNA used the Col-0 ecotype accession while BRIC-16-Cyt used Ler-0. Each of these groups grew seedlings on agar plates for 14 d, at which point seedlings were stabilized with RNAlater in-flight. Use of in-flight −80°C cold stowage for rapid freezing was unavailable for STS-131, so all samples were returned to Earth in RNAlater at ambient temperature. Preflight preparation of BRIC-16-Cyt For the BRIC-16-Cyt experiment (J. Z. Kiss, Principal Investigator), seeds ofArabidopsis thaliana(Ler-0) were surface-sterilized in a solution of 1 drop octyl phenol ethoxylate (TX-100) in 100 mL of 70% (v/v) ethanol for 5 min, followed by two, 1-min rinses in 95% (v/v) ethanol. An additional washing with 1 drop TX-100 in 100 mL water was followed by four final rinses in sterile water. Under sterile conditions within a laminar flow hood, seeds were sown in one row of 40 seeds on 13 total Petri plates (60 mm) on 1.2% (w/v) agar containing 1 mM MES buffer at pH 5.5, 1% (w/v) sucrose, one-half strength Murashige and Skoog basal salts (Millar et al., 2011). During the sowing process of the BRIC-16-Cyt seeds, the quality of each seed was assessed using a stereomicroscope and damaged seeds were discarded. Petri plates were sealed with Parafilm M (Bemis Company, Oshkosh, Wisconsin, USA), placed in a sealed sterile box then allowed 1 day incubation in darkness at a controlled 24°C before integration into the Biological Research in Canisters-Petri Dish Fixation Unit (BRIC-PDFU) flight hardware (Kern et al., 1999;Millar et al., 2011). Integration of biological specimens into the flight hardware was conducted in sterile conditions within a laminar flow hood by engineering staff at the NASA Space Life Sciences Laboratory (SLSL, Kennedy Space Center, Florida, USA). Directionality of each PDFU was maintained as its fluid compartment was filled with 13 mL of RNAlater (Ambion, Foster City, California, USA). Each PDFU was then tested for leaks and placed within the external BRIC shell. The assembled BRIC-PDFUs were placed within a half-sized middeck locker on the Space ShuttleDiscovery36 h before launch (seeMillar et al., 2011;Kwon et al., 2015; andPaul et al., 2012bfor additional details on preparation of the BRIC-PDFU spaceflight hardware). Comparison of preflight preparation among the BRIC-16 investigative teams All three groups used the BRIC-PDFU flight hardware. BRIC-16-Cyt was conducted using the Ler-0 ecotype, while BRIC-16-DNA and BRIC-16-Reg used the Col-0 ecotype as the wild type. All plants were grown in the dark on 60 mm petri plates and on a similar agar substrate that included MS salts. Plates from both BRIC-16-Reg and BRIC-16-Cyt were made up of 1.2% (w/v) agar with half-strength MS salts and 1% (w/v) sucrose. BRIC-16-DNA used 0.5% (w/v) PhytagelArabidopsisPlate Media with half-strength MS salts (Paul et al., 2013;Schultz et al., 2012). Quantities of medium were equivalent for each group (6.5–6.7 mL per plate). While all seeds were sown before loading the hardware, the patterns in which they were sown were different. BRIC-16-DNA contained seeds sown in a grid pattern, with approximately 75 seeds per plate (Paul et al., 2012b;Schultz et al., 2012), while BRIC-16-Cyt seeds were sown in a dense line of 39–42 seeds across the center of each plate (seeMillar et al., 2011), and BRIC-16-Reg plates contained 150–200 seeds in a series of lines for molecular studies (Kwon et al., 2015). Seeds for the BRIC-16-Cyt were wet-sown in nanopure water, while BRIC-16-Reg seeds were dry-sown from sterile filter paper following surface-sterilization (supplemental photo fromKwon et al., 2015). Thus, sowing techniques and substrates varied among the three investigative groups. Launch, landing, and sample processing For all of the BRIC-16 flight samples, stabilization in RNAlater was completed in-orbit by an astronaut after 309 h of growth of the plants in darkness in the BRIC-PDFU. Following landing and after 53 h in RNA later, the BRIC-16 samples were prepared for deintegration. The three BRIC-16 investigative teams followed this timeline. Petri plates then were removed from the flight hardware and the BRIC-16-Cyt plates with seedlings were photographed for gross morphology and germination analyses. BRIC-16-Cyt seedlings were placed in RNAse-free vials with fresh RNAlater and transported on ice to the University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida (USA). Upon arrival at the university, microarray samples were placed in a freezer at −80°C for storage until extraction for RNA. Ground controls for all BRIC-16 samples were prepared in the same initial manner but with a 24-h delay from spaceflight samples. A ground control locker was placed within a growth chamber known as the orbital environmental simulator (OES) at the SLSL, which attempted to duplicate the temperature and humidity data collected fromDiscovery’s middeck, on a 24-h delay. The ground control locker was repositioned manually to mimic the directionality changes of the Shuttle’s launch sequence. Stabilization of all BRIC-16 samples was conducted in parallel to the process in-orbit, again on the same 24-h delay. Cell wall glycomics of BRIC-16-Cyt The cell wall glycomics analyses were performed at the University of Georgia Complex Carbohydrate Research Center (CCRC, Athens, GA). Tissue that remained in the shredder columns from the RNA extraction process from BRIC-16-Cyt samples were used to run an ELISA-based glycome analysis employing a comprehensive suite of plant cell wall glycan directed monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) (Pattathil et al., 2012,2015,2016). Microarray preparations for the BRIC-16-Cyt seedlings The contents of one BRIC from spaceflight (F) and two BRICs, each from a separate ground control (G), were set aside for the molecular component of the study. Each BRIC included five PDFUs (which contained one Petri plate). To clarify the sample size: each Petri plate was sown with 40 seeds, and germination rates were 89% for flight and 90% for ground Petri plates in the BRIC-16-Cyt study, providing a total of approximately 178 seedlings from spaceflight and 360 from ground control for molecular work. Of these, half of the seedlings harvested from four spaceflight PDFUs (79 seedlings) and nine ground control PDFUs (160 seedlings) were used for the microarray analyses. Samples were transferred to RNase-free microcentrifuge tubes containing fresh RNAlater for transportation. To process the BRIC-16-Cyt samples before the microarray studies, we thawed the samples and bisected them to separate roots from shoots. Tissues from shoots only were used for this study. Tissue of shoots was disrupted in a microcentrifuge tube using a Pellet Pestle motor (Kontes, Vineland, New Jersey, USA) and sterile RNase-free pestle tip (Stimpson et al., 2009). Extraction was conducted using the RNeasy Mini Plant Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the procedure outlined in the RNeasy Mini Handbook. The total RNA was provided to the University of Florida’s Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research (ICBR) Gene Expression Core Facility. There, sample was quantified using the NanoDrop Spectrophotometer ND-8000 (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, Delaware, USA), and quality was determined using the RNA 6000 Pico LabChip (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, California, USA) and its corresponding ladder (RNA 6000 ladder, Ambion, Foster City, California, USA) containing transcript sizes of 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0 and 6.0 kb on a Bioanalyzer (Agilent). Of the samples prepared, the three plates with the highest quality RNA were chosen from ground control and spaceflight to run the microarray inAppendix S1(see theSupplemental Datawith this article). RNA amplification and purification of BRIC-16-Cyt were conducted by the ICBR using the Ovation Pico WTA system for biotin target labeling. Chemical and enzymatic fragmentation of cRNA was completed in a thermal cycler at 37°C for 60 min, and 70°C for 10 min, with a final holding at 4°C until sample removal. The NanoDrop spectrophotometer was used to assess the yield of the labeled cRNA. Hybridization to the microarray gene chip was conducted following the standard protocol outlined in the technical manual for Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). The BRIC-16-Cyt microarrays were washed and stained using the Affymetrix GeneChip Fluidics Station 450 according to the Affymetrix standard protocol outlined in the Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis technical manual. Nonstringent wash buffer was used for washing. Streptavidin phycoerythrin (SAPE) was used for the staining process. Scanning was completed using the GeneChip Scanner 3000. Raw data were presented in the form of 570 nm light emission, the intensity of which is proportional to the number of targets bound at each locus of the array. Raw data from microarray studies was processed using Microarray Suite Version 5 software (Affymetrix) to convert the intensity information to quantitative values. Raw microarray data were generated by each of the three investigative teams. The data obtained from BRIC-16-Reg and BRIC-16-DNA were deposited in the ArrayExpress electronic database (Kolesnikov et al., 2015). BRIC-16-Reg can be found under the identifier E-MTAB-3011, while BRIC-16-DNA is identified as E-MTAB-1009. BRIC-16-Cyt data were deposited in the NASA GeneLab under accession number GLDS-121 (https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-121/). To test the hypothesis that the observed transcriptomic differences among BRIC-16-Cyt, -Reg, and -DNA were due to experimental differences (and not random due to poor RNA or experimental error), we conducted a pairwise analysis of the ground controls from each experiment. Then, we performed a pairwise analysis of the spaceflight samples from each experiment. The data were then checked for overlap between the spaceflight and ground control. This process was repeated using each normalization method (RMA, MAS5, PLIER). To show that the number of stress genes was not abnormally high in the BRIC-16-Cyt samples as compared with the other investigative teams, we conducted a gene-level differential expression analysis: a one-way between-subject unpaired ANOVA to compare BRIC-16-Cyt ground controls with BRIC-16-DNA and BRIC-16-Reg ground control samples. The GO data were collected for the resulting gene lists and sorted. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) of BRIC-16-Cyt seedlings Shoots of seedlings from the BRIC-16-Cytoskeleton (BRIC-16-Cyt) group’s spaceflight-grown and ground control were also used for the qRT-PCR, and the following procedures took place at Miami University (Oxford, Ohio, USA). Seedlings were shipped overnight on dry ice from −80°C storage at the University of Florida and placed in −80°C storage upon arrival. Seedlings were defrosted, then dissected in RNAlater, disrupted using a pellet pestle motor and sterile pestle, and RNA was extracted from the shoots using the RNeasy Mini Plant Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, California, USA), according to the procedure outlined previously (Stimpson et al., 2009). Following extraction, excess fluid was evaporated using a centrifugal vacuum evaporator Savant Speed Vac Concentrator (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). Evaporated RNA was re-eluted using RNase-free water and converted to cDNA using the QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen). First, genomic DNA was removed by incubating RNA for 2 min with gDNA Wipeout Buffer in a 42°C water bath. Next, the samples underwent reverse transcription through incubation at 42°C with Quantiscript Reverse Transcriptase, Qantiscript RT Buffer, and RT Primer mix, followed by inactivation of the process by placing them in a 95°C water bath for 3 min. A negative control was run alongside spaceflight and ground samples during the reverse transcription process. This negative control lacked reverse transcriptase, but contained all other reaction products. Primers used for qRT-PCR by the BRIC-16-Cytoskeleton research group. Cell wall glycomics of BRIC-16-Cyt Comparative glycomics analyses of ground and spaceflight grown shoot samples ofArabidopsis thaliana. Cell-wall-glycan-directed mAbs-based ELISA screening of 4 M KOH cell wall extracts prepared from ground- and spaceflight-grown shoot samples ofArabidopsis thalianawas conducted to enable a comparative glycomics analysis. This comprehensive collection of 155 mAbs (labels in lower panel) used in the screen monitored most major classes of noncellulosic matrix cell wall glycans. The binding strengths of the mAbs that corresponded to the abundance of matrix glycan epitopes are depicted as a heatmap with a bright yellow to black color scheme in which bright yellow depicts the strongest binding and the black no binding. The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) Gene Ontology data showing (A1) upregulated cellular component, (A2) downregulated cellular component, (B1) upregulated biological process, (B2) downregulated biological process, and (C1) upregulated molecular function, (C2) downregulated molecular function for the BRIC-16-Cytoskeleton group. A comparison of Space Flight/Ground Control (F/G) with RMA-normalized data, −5 ≤ fold-change ≥ 5 (P< 0.01). The most downregulated biological process was response to stress. The nucleus was the most common cellular component localized for downregulated transcripts. GO cellular component data for our BRIC-16-Cyt experiments (Fig. 2A) indicated that most transcripts that were upregulated in spaceflight conditions were localized in the extracellular matrix, membranes, and the cell wall, while the majority of downregulated transcripts were localized in the nucleus. Biological process GO data (Fig. 2B) showed many upregulated transcripts were implicated in metabolic processes and transport, while the downregulated were often involved in stress response. GO molecular function data (Fig. 2C) indicated that the most upregulated transcripts were involved in enzyme activity, while the downregulated were implicated in some form of binding, including protein binding and DNA or RNA binding (Fig. 2C). GO data were used when identifying genes involved in hypoxia, heat shock response, cell wall organization, and water relations, as presented in the discussion. Hierarchical clustering of RMA-normalized BRIC-16-Cyt data showed that the transcriptomes of the flight samples clustered together, while the transcriptomes of the ground samples formed another distinct cluster. Within the genes, we found a clustering of dehydration-responsive genes that were downregulated includingXERO1(AT3G50980) andLTI78(AT5G52310). Another cluster grouped the arabinogalactan proteinFLA8(akaAGP8;AT2G45470) with expansin expression, includingEXPA4(akaEXP4;AT2G39700) (Fig. 3). Hierarchical clustering of BRIC-16-Cytoskeleton data, normalized using RMA: spaceflight vs. ground control; −5 ≤ fold-change ≥ 5 (P< 0.01). Downregulated transcripts (black) and upregulated transcripts (white) are shown on a grayscale gradient of black to white.DRT100(AT3G12610) is a DNA damage repair protein that is downregulated in ground control. Water stress genes, includingLTI78(AT5G52310),XERO1(AT3G50980), are clustered, andDREB2A(AT5G05410) are clustered as downregulated in spaceflight and upregulated in ground control. To produce this heat map and dendrogram, we calculated the Euclidean distance between expression vectors to determine the similarity between two genes. Cluster-to-cluster distances were determined by complete linkage. Also, genes for some heat shock proteins were found to be differentially regulated 5-fold or more (P< 0.01), including the downregulated (F/G)HSP101(AT1G74310) andHSP90.1(AT5G52640), andHSP40(AT2G20550), which was upregulated (F/G) in the BRIC-16-Cyt data. Seedlings from BRIC-16-Cyt, BRIC-16-Reg, and BRIC-16-DNA grew for the same length of time, and all were stabilized in-flight using RNAlater. Off-loading from the Space Shuttle and postprocessing were conducted at the same time and in a similar fashion for each group. Whole seedlings were analyzed by the BRIC-16-DNA and BRIC-16-Reg groups, while BRIC-16-Cyt dissected the seedlings before extraction, and we used only the shoots from seedlings for our molecular analyses. Extraction of RNA and the microarrays for BRIC-16-Cyt and BRIC-16-DNA were conducted by staff at the ICBR (Gainesville, Florida, USA) and by staff at the Noble Foundation (Ardmore, Oklahoma, USA) for BRIC-16-Reg. All three groups reported relatively poor quality RNA (Appendix S1;Kwon et al., 2015;Paul et al., 2012b). RNAlater was used by all three investigative groups to stabilize the RNA between the end of the experiment and the time of extraction. Venn diagram showing a comparison of gene transcripts in a comparison of Space Flight/Ground Control (F/G) (downregulated and upregulated combined) in each study. BRIC-16-Cytoskeleton and BRIC-16-Regulation data were normalized using RMA, while BRIC-16-DNA microarrays were normalized using MAS5. For all groups, −5 ≤ fold-change ≥ 5 (P< 0.01). No transcripts were found in common among the three investigative teams. One transcript was in common between BRIC-16-Cyt and BRIC-16-DNA. Six transcripts were in common between BRIC-16-Cyt and BRIC-16-Reg. Transcripts significantly differentially regulated by more than one investigative team. Comparison of Space Flight/Ground Control, −5 ≤ FC ≥ 5 (P< 0.01). FC = fold-change. To verify that the reported downregulation of stress genes in spaceflight was not due to a high level of stress in the ground control samples, we conducted a gene-level differential expression analysis with a one-way between-subject unpaired ANOVA to compare BRIC-16-Cyt ground control samples with BRIC-16-DNA and BRIC-16-Reg ground control samples. In this comparison, 12% of the biological process GO terms of the BRIC-16-Cyt samples were categorized as response to stress, while only 5% of the GO terms of the combined BRIC-16-DNA and BRIC-16-Reg ground controls were categorized as response to stress. This series of comparisons indicates that more stress-response genes were present in the BRIC-16-Cyt ground controls compared with the other two investigative teams. Changes in cell wall during spaceflight Convection issues and hypoxia during spaceflight Previous spaceflight studies have investigated the alteration of convection inμg(Porterfield et al., 1999) and determined that insufficient levels of oxygen, or hypoxia, were present in spaceflight-grown plants (Stout et al., 2001;Liao et al., 2004). Altered air circulation was also a factor in this study, as evidenced by differences in temperature among BRICs (Millar et al., 2011;Paul et al., 2012b). This hypoxic condition impacts the sugar and starch content of the plant, with differences among the stems, leaves, and roots (Porterfield et al., 1997). BRIC-16-Cyt and BRIC-16-Reg showed differentially regulated genes with GO data that indicated a hypoxic response. These areHSFA2andPLA2A. HSFA2(AT2G26150) was found to be differentially regulated in BRIC-16-Cyt, andPLA2A(AT2G26560) was differentially regulated in our analysis of BRIC-16-Reg. Both of these genes were downregulated (F/G, −5 ≥ FC ≥ 5,P< 0.01) in these studies, which indicates that in this hardware, hypoxia was less of an issue for spaceflight-grown plants than for their ground control equivalents. In flooded or otherwise hypoxic environments, plants develop adventitious roots, which immediately transport oxygen from the substrate to shoots (Ayi et al., 2016). Interestingly, in BRIC-16-Cyt, we observed an abundance of adventitious roots growing from the shoots of spaceflight samples (Millar et al., 2011). Thus, this abundance of adventitious roots could account for the reduction in shoot hypoxia. The current study was aided by the close collaboration of three investigative groups, who participated in an experiment using identical hardware in the BRIC-16 project during the STS-131 mission of the Space Shuttle. Sharing raw data among investigative teams studyingArabidopsishas become common due to large open data sets accessible through TAIR and similar databases. In an effort to maximize collaborations, NASA has built an open bioinformatics-driven platform entitled GeneLab (Alwood et al., 2017), which brings together NASA space life science research-omics data from the diverse research programs of ISS and NASA. GeneLab (https://genelab.nasa.gov) will facilitate additional bioinformatics analyses of diverse spaceflight studies to help improve our understanding of how plants and other biological systems respond to the challenges of spaceflight.
