Introduction:It may take decades to develop cardiovascular dysfunction following exposure to high doses of ionizing radiation from medical therapy or from nuclear accidents. Since astronauts may be exposed continually to a complex space radiation environment unlike that experienced on Earth, it is unresolved whether there is a risk to cardiovascular health during long-term space exploration missions. Previously, we have described that mice exposed to a single dose of simplified Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR5-ion) develop cardiovascular dysfunction by 12 months post-radiation. We recently reported on long term functional changes to the heart following a single dose of GCR5-ion(Bishawi et al., 2022). Physiologically, this dysfunction was manifested as changes in arterial elastance, and histologically, there was evidence of elastin fragmentation in the aorta. Of the protein markers we evaluated (Fibulin-4, Fibulin-5, TGF-beta1, and EGFR), EGFR was the only marker that showed a statistically significant decrease in hearts from GCR-irradiated animals compared to age-matched sham irradiated controls (Bishawi et al., 2022). Other investigations have also examined the levels of individual cardiac protein markers in studies where rodents or rabbits were exposed to components of GCR (reviewed inDavis et al., 2021;Seawright et al., 2019;Amino et al., 2010;Soucy et al., 2011). These studies have indicated that a number of proteins and pathways and biological functions are permanently affected in the heart from a single exposure of space relevant radiation. Seawright et al. (Seawright et al., 2019) noted an increase in a 75 kDa peptide of collagen type III in the left ventricle of rats exposed to protons (250 MeV) and16O (600 MeV/n and 1 GeV/n), suggesting that these components of GCR caused remodeling of existing collagens in the heart. Also noted in this study were increases in the amounts of CD2, CD68, and CD45 proteins at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 9 months after exposure to protons or16O alone, suggesting immune cell infiltration. In a rabbit model, hearts exposed to 15 Gy of targeted heavy ion irradiation (THIR) exhibited a significant upregulation of connexin 43 (Cx43) protein and mRNA in the ventricular myocardium by immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and real-time PCR from 2 weeks out to 1 year after a single exposure (Amino et al., 2010). Cx43, the major connexin in cardiac gap junction, plays an essential role in the synchronized contraction of the heart and perturbations in Cx43 levels could profoundly influence cardiac function. Soucy et al. examined xanthine oxidase (XO) activity in the aortas of rats exposed to whole-body exposure of iron ion radiation (56Fe-ion) at doses of 0, 0.5, or 1 Gy (Soucy et al., 2011).In vivoaortic stiffness andex vivoaortic tension responses were measured 6 and 8 months after exposure as indicators of chronic vascular injury. Rats exposed to 1 Gy56Fe-ion demonstrated significantly increased aortic stiffness, as measured by pulse wave velocity. XO activity was significantly elevated in rat aorta 4 months after whole-body irradiation. Recently, Azimzadeh et al. published a comprehensive review of the available omics data (proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, epigenomics, and multi-omics) of radiation-induced cardiovascular disease focusing on gamma and X-ray exposure (Azimzadeh et al., 2022). Across 27 published proteomics data sets, mitochondrial proteins were the most sensitive protein cluster affected in irradiated hearts across different types and doses of radiation, with many of these mitochondrial proteins being significantly downregulated. In addition, long term downregulation of many anti-oxidant defense proteins was observed in many publication examining mouse models as well as validated in studies of heart autopsies obtained from workers in the nuclear industry. While recentlyLaiakis et al (2022)have utilized label-free mass spectrometry untargeted quantitative proteomic profiling to characterize the proteome of the prefrontal cortex in rats exposed to28Si ions, there have been no corresponding studies undertaken to understand the global proteomic changes occurring in the heart following exposure to components of space radiation. As the proteome can provide a better understanding of the structure and the function of the organism than genomics, we have performed a quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics analysis of heart tissue (proteome and phosphoproteome) and plasma (proteome only) from mice exposed to GCR5-ion. Integration of these three omics data sets has enabled a more comprehensive understanding of the systemic impact of GCR5-ionand suggests that sustained inflammatory response with neutrophil extracellular trap formation is one of the major pathways driving the biological responses to space radiation in the heart. Overview of sample preparation, processing, and bioinformatics analysis pipeline. All animal experiments were approved by the Duke University and Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUCs). Approximately 24-week old male C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Labs) were exposed to 150 cGy GCR5-ion(H 1,000 MeV/n,28Si 600 MeV/n,4He 250 MeV/n,16O 350 MeV/n,56Fe 600 MeV/n, and H 250 MeV/n) using the beam line at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at BNL (Simonsen et al., 2020). Sham irradiated control animals were placed in equitable holders over a schedule which mimicked the experimental groups but were not irradiated. Post-radiation, animals were allowed at least 2 days to recover, and then were returned to Duke University animal facilities. Hearts and plasma for proteomics were obtained from mice at 8 months post radiation (n = 6 for hearts and n = 10 for plasma). An equal number of hearts and plasma samples was obtained from age-matched sham irradiated control animals. Hearts for other evaluations such as Western blot or immunofluorescence studies were obtained from mice at 12 months post radiation and equivalent age-matched sham irradiated control animals were used as comparators. Heart tissue (phospho)proteomics Frozen tissues were weighed and lysed by tissue tearor in 1.5 mL of 5% sodium docecyl sulfate (SDS)/50 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5 (TEAB) followed by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay. The amount of 250 μg of each sample was normalized to 50 μL with SDS/TEAB buffer followed by the addition of bovine casein (300 fmol and 150 fmol per µg added to irradiated and sham irradiated control samples, respectively) and digestion using an S-trap mini device, followed by Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) labeling (with lot# TK2735U and TL272831), high pH-reversed phase (HPRP) fractionation, and phosphopeptide enrichment as previously described (Walejko et al., 2021). One-dimensional liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (1D-LC-MS/MS) was performed on ∼0.5 μg each of the unenriched fractions, and 2.5 μL of the phosphopeptide-enriched fractions were analyzed using a nanoACQUITY UPLC system (Waters) coupled to a Fusion Lumos high resolution accurate mass tandem mass spectrometer (Thermo) in a time-dependent (3 s) data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mode with a 120,000 resolution (@ m/z 200) full MS scan from m/z 375 to 1,600 with a target automatic gain control (AGC) value of 2e5 ions and 50 ms maximum injection time (IT) and internal calibration (eIC) enabled. Peptides were selected for MS/MS using monoisotopic precursor selection (MIPS) and a dynamic exclusion of 45 s. Peptides with charge state 2 (scan priority 1) were selected for MS/MS using an isolation width of 1.2 and higher energy collision-induced dissociation (HCD) with a stepped normalized collision energy of 36.1, 38, and 39.9 with detection in the orbitrap using a resolution of 50,000, an AGC target of 1e5, and max IT of 105 ms. Peptides with charge states 3–5 (scan priority 2) were selected for MS/MS with an isolation window of 0.7 m/z. Phosphoproteome data were analyzed using Thermo Proteome Discoverer 2.3. Re-calibrated.mgf Calibrated .mgf files were created the Spectrum Files RC node and database searching was performed against the Uniprot database withMus musculustaxonomy (downloaded on 04/22/19; 20,204 entries) appended with bovine casein isoform protein sequences. Searches used Mascot v 2.5 with 5 ppm precursor and 0.02 product ion tolerances, trypsin specificity with up to two missed cleavages, fixed carbamidomethylation (Cys) and TMT10 (Lys and peptide N-terminal), and variable phosphorylation (Ser, Thr, and Tyr). Percolator and imp-ptmRS nodes were used for FDR determination and site localization. The processing node of the reporter ions quantifier used a 10 ppm integration tolerance, and the consensus node used correction for isotope impurity, a co-isolation threshold of 50%, and S/N threshold of 5. Normalization to total peptide amount and imputation using low abundance resampling were applied. Proteome data was analyzed in Proteome Discoverer 2.4 using the MS-Fragger (Chang et al., 2023) and Percolator nodes with default parameters. The mouse database was appended with additional contaminant sequences including human keratins. Imputation used low abundance resampling, and protein quantities were calculated from summed peptide abundances. Normalization used sample loading and trimmed mean in R as previously described (Wakeham et al., 2019). Plasma proteomics utilized sodium deoxycholate (SDC)-assisted in solution digestion followed by microflow liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry using variable window data-independent acquisition (DIA) as previously described (Kamyszek et al., 2020) with the following modifications. Briefly, 15 μL of plasma was adjusted to 5% SDC in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate and 10 mM dithiothreitol followed by reduction at 80°C for 20 min and alkylation with 25 mM iodoacetamide at room temp for 30 min. Proteins were digested with 37.5 μg Worthington modified bovine trypsin for 4 h at 37°C followed by the addition of 1.5% (v/v) trifluoracetic acid and 2% (v/v) acetonitrile and Massprep ADH1 peptide standard (Waters; final concentration 30 fmol ADH1/µl). The SDC precipitate was filtered under vacuum using an ISOLUTE Filtration + filter plate (Biotage) and collected in a Deepwell 96/1,000 µL plate (Eppendorf). Twelve microliters of peptide digest (∼40 μg) were analyzed per sample in a block-randomized order, interspersed with replicates of a study pool QC (SPQC) sample made from a mixture of all samples. Liquid chromatography used a 1 mm × 150 mm 1.7 µm CSH C18 column (Waters) and a ACQUITY UPLC (Waters) at a flow rate of 100 μL/min and a gradient of 3%–28% acetonitrile over 60 min. The LC was interfaced to a Thermo HF-X MS via a heated electrospray ionization (HESI) source. DIA mass spectrometry analysis used a 120,000 resolution precursor ion (MS1) scan from 375 to 1,500 m/z, an AGC target of 3E6, and maximum injection time (IT) of 20 ms; data were collected in profile mode. MS/MS was performed using 30,000 resolution, an AGC target of 3e6 and maximum IT of 60 ms, and 19 variable DIA windows that spanned 375–1,200 m/z. Data were collected in profile mode. In addition, ∼800 μg of the SPQC sample was analyzed using high pH-reversed phase (HPRP) fractionation using a 2.1 mm × 5 cm BEH C18 column (Waters) and Agilent 1100 HPLC as previously described (Glisinski et al., 2020) with a mobile phase of 20 mM ammonium formate, pH 10, and a gradient of 3%–35% MeCN over 50 min. Forty-eight equal fractions were collected and concatenated to 12 fractions. After lyophilization, samples were resuspended in 24 μL of 1% (v/v) TFA/2% (v/v) MeCN in H2O, and 12 μL was analyzed by microflow-DDA using the same LC method as previously described and a 120,000 resolution precursor (MS1) scan from 375 to 1,500 m/z, an AGC target of 3e6, and maximum injection time (IT) of 45 ms, followed by MS/MS (MS2) of the top 10 most abundant ions at 45,000 resolution with an AGC target of 5e4 ions and 86 milliseconds (ms) IT, 1.2 m/z isolation window, a stepped normalized collision energy (NCE) of 25, 27.5, and 30, a minimum AGC target of 1e4, and 20 s dynamic exclusion. Protein orthology mapping, pathway enrichment analysis, and clustering Mouse heart tissues were mechanically homogenized in Tris Buffered Saline with Tween 20 (TBST) lysis buffer. Protein concentration was determined using BCA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific #23227, United States) using BioTek Gene 5 software with a 562 nm wavelength. Then, 7.5% precast polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad #4568026, United States) were run at 100 V for 75 min and transferred to 0.2 μm Polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes by electrophoretic transfer through a tank transfer system at a constant voltage of 30 V for 30 min at 4°C. The membrane was blocked overnight with TBST with 5% non-fat milk (w/v). Primary antibodies KRT10 (Thermo Fisher: MA5-32183, United States), KRT1 (Thermo Fisher: 16848-1-AP, United States) KRT6a (Thermo Fisher: 10590-1-AP, United States), MRPL49 (Thermo Fisher: PA5-112889, United States), fibrinogen gamma (Thermo Fisher: PA5-21968, United States), fibrinogen beta (16747-1-AP; Thermo Fisher, United States), fibrinogen alpha (20645-1-AP; Thermo Fisher, United States), calmodulin 2 (PA5-121166, Thermo Fisher, United States), alpha 2 macroglobulin (MA5-38211, Thermo Fisher, United States), and CAMK2G (CAMKII-301AP, Thermo Fisher, United States) were incubated for 2 h in TBST with 5% non-fat milk (w/v). The membranes were washed prior to incubation with secondary antibody Anti-Rabbit HRP conjugated Ab from (BioRad: #1706515, United States) for 1 hour and subsequently washed with TBST. Membrane was visualized with Clarity™ Western ECL Substrate (Bio-Rad # 1705060, United States) for 5 min, and chemiluminescent images were taken using a BioRad Chemidoc. Densitometric analysis was conducted with Image Lab 6.1 software (Bio-Rad: #12012931, United States). Fresh frozen heart bases were embedded in Tissue-Tek® O.C.T. Compound and sectioned to 10 µm. The sections were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Tween-20 (Sigma Aldrich, United States) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). They were then blocked with 5% normal goat serum in 0.1% Tween-20. The primary antibodies used were Fibrinogen beta (16747-1-AP; Thermo Fisher, United States), Fibrinogen alpha (20645-1-AP; Thermo Fisher, United States) C4b-BP (PIPA528017; Thermo Fisher, United States), and C4d (HP8033; Hycult Biotech, United States) each at a final dilution of 1:200. After washing, they were incubated with polyclonal goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 594 conjugated antibody (ab150080; Abcam, United States) at a final dilution of 1:400. ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant with DAPI (Invitrogen, United States) was added onto the section and a coverslip was placed. A Leica 780 Upright Microscope (Wetzlar, Germany) was used to acquire the images of the tissue sections. Immunofluorescence staining for neutrophil extracellular traps Frozen sections of 10 μm, taken from the cardiac apex of mice embedded in OCT, were utilized to investigate the presentation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). To stain the samples, a rabbit anti-elastase antibody (Catalog # PA5-88916, Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA) diluted 1:100 and a goat anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO) primary antibody (AF 3667, R and D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) diluted to a concentration of 10 μg/mL were employed. Subsequently, the sections were treated with a goat anti-rabbit secondary polyclonal antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594 (Abcam, Cat no. ab150080, Cambridge, United Kingdom) at a dilution of 1:200 and a donkey anti-goat secondary polyclonal antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (Catalog # A-11055; Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA) at a dilution of 1:200. The formation of NETs was examined using a Nikon Ti2 Eclipse inverted confocal microscope.

Neutrophil extracellular traps were elevated in myocardium of GCR5-ionirradiated mice 12 months post irradiation The presence of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) within the myocardial tissue was observed in a mouse model exposed to GCR5-ion. Immunofluorescence staining was performed to assess the presence of NETs in the hearts of mice exposed to 150 mGy of GCR5-ionat 12 months post radiation, as compared to sham irradiated control mice hearts.(A)A robust and extensive distribution of NETs was observed in the myocardium of mice exposed to GCR5-ion(upper panel), while no NETs were detected in the control mice hearts (lower panel).(B)The representative images of NETs structure in the hearts of mice exposed to GCR were obtained. The colocalization of extracellular DNA structure (DAPI), MPO, and elastase further confirmed the presence of NET structures(B). The scale bar represents 50 μm. Based on data from epidemiological studies, it takes a significant amount of time for cardiovascular disease to develop (up to decades). There is relatively little knowledge regarding the time frame to develop cardiovascular disease from exposure to the space radiation environment. Here, we undertook a multi-proteomics approach to characterize protein and pathway perturbations that occurred in hearts and plasma from mice exposed to a single dose of GCR5-ion8 months prior. One of the most interesting observations was that across the three data sets, the abundance of the majority of the DEPs diminished in the heart and plasma at 8 months post radiation. While one acute effect of radiation is to cause fragmentation and aggregation of protein molecules (Kumta and Tappel, 1961), it is possible that the effects observed at 8 months post radiation may be due to the inhibition of protein synthesis. We previously reported that microgravity, another stressor of space travel, reduced protein turnover in cardiomyocytes (Feger et al., 2016) and speculated that this diminishment in protein synthesis could lead to overall reduction in cardiomyocyte protein content. In the plasma proteome, the most significantly regulated protein was major urinary protein 20 (MUP20) which was upregulated in irradiated animals. MUP20 is a male pheromone which promotes aggressive male behavior, stimulates female sexual attraction to male urinary scent, promotes a strong learned attraction to the airborne urinary odor of an individual male, and promotes spatial learning by rapidly conditioning preference for its remembered location among females and competitor males so that animals prefer to spend time in the site even when scent is absent (Roberts et al., 2010;Roberts et al., 2010;Demir et al., 2020). While this finding may not be translatable since humans are the only placental mammals found not to have any active MUP genes (Logan et al., 2008), the finding of MUP20 dysregulation in male mice exposed to GCR5-ionmay illuminate behavioral and learning changes following exposures of rodents to various GCR components. Other proteins dysregulated in the plasma following GCR irradiation are serum amyloid A1 (SAA1) (upregulated) and glutathione S-transferase theta-3 (GSTT3) (downregulated). SAA1 is a major acute-phase protein mainly produced by hepatocytes in response to infection, tissue injury, and malignancy. SAA has anti-inflammatory properties by inhibiting platelet aggregation and by reducing the oxidative burst in Polymorphonuclear neutrophils(Zimlichman et al., 1990;Gatt et al., 1998). SAA also has proinflammatory effects, such as induction of extracellular matrix degrading enzymes, allowing the repair of tissue damage and inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1B, IL-6, and TNFa (Uhlar and Whitehead, 1999). GSTT3 is expressed strongly in the liver (and to a lesser extent in kidney and testis). Glutathione transferases play a significant role in the metabolism/detoxification process of a wide range of electrophilic compounds that include mutagens, carcinogens, reactive oxygen species, and some therapeutic agents. Perhaps the most interesting finding from this study involves neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). NETs have come to the forefront of immunology for their fundamental role in combating bacterial pathogens. Beyond this defensive capacity, intriguingly, NETs have shown the ability to modulate inflammatory responses, even within sterile environments (Papayannopoulos, 2018). One remarkable illustration of this involves the role of cholesterol crystals in prompting the formation of NETs, which subsequently stimulate macrophages to unleash IL-1-beta, a process known to expedite the development of atherosclerosis (Warnatsch et al., 2015). This process becomes particularly concerning when a plaque rupture transpires. The resulting exposure of endovascular NETs can escalate vascular thrombosis, a factor intimately tied to severe cardiovascular events like acute myocardial infarction and stroke (Klopf et al., 2021). Our study has unveiled some illuminating findings in this area. Employing proteomic analysis, we discovered that the NETs formation pathway was activated in mice exposed to Galactic Cosmic Radiation (GCR), and myocardium sections exhibited a significant accumulation of NETs in these mice after long-term high-energy GCR exposure. We found NETs presentation in the myocardium, but no significant enrichment of inflammatory cytokines was identified in the plasma. Neutrophils serve as the first-line of innate immunity. The cytokines that trigger NETs formation might be detectable during the acute injury stage. Thus, there is a pressing need for another study that collects samples shortly after GCR exposure to accurately determine what triggers NETs. While the exact mechanism behind NET formation following GCR exposure remains elusive in our study and whether NET formation may have played a role in the astronaut’s development of VTE is unknown, we propose a hypothesis involving chronic tissue damage and reactive oxygen species (ROS) activation post-radiation exposure as potential mechanisms, warranting further investigation.

All images are at ×40 magnification, with the scale bar indicating 20 μm. The original contributions presented in the study are publicly available.
