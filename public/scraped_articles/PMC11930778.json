Anhydrobiosis, a phenomenon in which organisms survive extreme dehydration by entering a reversible ametabolic state, is a remarkable example of survival strategies. This study focuses on anhydrobiosis in tardigrades, which are known for their resilience to severe environmental conditions. Tardigrades utilize several protective mechanisms against desiccation, notably the constitutive expression of cytoplasmic abundant heat soluble (CAHS) proteins inRamazzottius varieornatus. These proteins share similarities in their amphiphatic alpha helices with late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins, but differ significantly in their amino acid sequences. In this study, we further explored the functionality of CAHS proteins by analyzing their role in aggregation and tolerance to hyperosmotic stress in mammalian cells. Using live cell imaging, we examined the subcellular localization of several CAHS and LEA proteins in response to hyperosmotic stress. The expression of CAHS1, CAHS3, and CAHS8 tended to enhance the resilience to the hyperosmotic conditions. These findings not only deepen our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of anhydrobiosis but also highlight the potential of CAHS proteins as cryoprotectants. Anhydrobiosis, derived from “life without water” in Greek, is a phenomenon where an organism loses almost all of its water and enters a state of reversible ametabolism (Croweet al., 1998;Keilin, 1959). An organism capable of anhydrobiosis tolerates extreme dehydration (desiccation), dries to equilibrium with moderately to extremely dry air, and then restores its vital functions after rehydration. Anhydrobiosis is observed in both microorganisms and animals, including bacteria, nematodes, seeds, spores, gemma, lichen soredium, egg, shoot fragments, and more (García, 2011;Hibshmanet al., 2020;Leprince and Buitink, 2015). Desiccation primarily damages proteins, nucleic acids, and membrane lipids, leading to cell death. Therefore, living organisms that exhibit anhydrobiosis have protective mechanisms to mitigate desiccation. Trehalose accumulation (Croweet al., 1998;Lapinski and Tunnacliffe, 2003), late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins (Goyalet al., 2005;Kikawadaet al., 2006;MacRae, 2016), heat shock proteins (Cornetteet al., 2010;King and MacRae, 2015), and ROS scavenging (Gusevet al., 2010;Rizzoet al., 2010) have been proposed as mechanisms of desiccation tolerance (Janiset al., 2018). Tardigrades, widely used as model organisms for anhydrobiosis research, exhibit extreme tolerance to high and low temperatures, high pressure, and radiation in their anhydrobiotic state (Rebecchiet al., 2007;Wright, 2001). Although several reports have been reported on the defense mechanisms underlying anhydrobiosis in tardigrades, including induction of heat shock proteins and defensive peroxidases (Reuneret al., 2010;Rizzoet al., 2010;Schokraieet al., 2011;Yoshidaet al., 2022), cytoplasmic abundant heat soluble (CAHS) proteins, identified as a family of highly hydrophilic and heat-soluble proteins, have attracted much attention. CAHS proteins are constitutively expressed inRamazzottius varieornatus, which exhibits strong desiccation tolerance withoutde novogene expression. On the other hand, in another tardigrade,Hypsibius exemplaris, the expression of CAHS proteins is strongly induced under desiccated condition, and these expressions are essential for desiccation tolerance (Arakawa, 2022;Kondoet al., 2015,2019;Yoshidaet al., 2017). CAHS proteins share some similarities with LEA proteins in terms of bioinformatic predictions of a strong tendency for amphiphatic α-helix formation, despite their low amino acid sequence similarity to LEA proteins. Recently, several groups, including ours, have reported that the CAHS proteins demonstrate gelation, droplet, or fibrous structuresin vitroand in cells (Malkiet al., 2022;Tanakaet al., 2022;Velinget al., 2022;Yagi-Utsumiet al., 2021). It has also been shown that the heterologous expression of CAHS proteins suppresses hyperosmotic pressure-induced cell death of budding yeast, bacteria, andDrosphilaS2 cells (Boothbyet al., 2017;Tanakaet al., 2022). However, it remains unclear whether the heterologous expression of CAHS proteins confers hyperosmotic stress tolerance to cultured mammalian cells. In this study, we show the changes in the subcellular localization ofR. varieornatusCAHS1, CAHS3, CAHS8, CAHS12, late embryogenesis abundant protein mitochondrial (LEAM), and mitochondrial abundant heat soluble (MAHS) proteins upon hyperosmotic stress stimulation by live cell imaging in mammalian cultured cells. We also investigated the tolerance to hyperosmotic stress by the expression of CAHS proteins, and found that the expression of CAHS1, CAHS3, or CAHS8 rendered the cells tolerant to the hyperosmotic stress.

A solution of 0.5 M sorbitol (left panels) or 0.2 M sodium chloride (right panels) was added after 2 min. Insets are enlarged images of the enclosed area. After 5 min, the cells were washed with fresh medium using a microfluidic system. Scale bar, 10 μm. Effects of CAHS1-mEGFP expression on cell viability and cell death upon osmotic stress in HeLa cells Effects of CAHS3, CAHS8, or CAHS12 expression on cell viability upon osmotic stress in HeLa cells HeLa cells were kindly provided by Michiyuki Matsuda (Kyoto University). HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) high glucose (#08458-45, Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (#F7524, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Establishment of stable cell lines For transposon-mediated gene transfer, HeLa cells were transfected with Tol2 donor vectors and Tol2 transposase-expressing vectors in a 1:1 ratio. Approximately 16–24 h after transfection, the cells were treated with 1.0 μg/mL puromycin (#ant-pr-1, InvivoGen, San Diego, CA, USA) for more than one week to select bulk cell lines. Cells were maintained in the presence of puromycin. InFig. 2, the bright fluorescent cells were sorted into a 96-well plate using a cell sorter (MA900, SONY, Tokyo, Japan), and the single cell clone was used inFig. 2. The bulk cell population was used inFig. 3. Time-lapse imaging with hyperosmotic stress HeLa cells were seeded on a 35-mm dish (#150460, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA) or a 6 well plate (#140675, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The plasmid expressing the CAHS1-mEGFP protein, the CAHS3-mEGFP, the CAHS8-mEGFP, the CAHS12-mEGFP, the LEAM-mEGFP, the MAHS-mEGFP and the mEGFP were transfected into the HeLa cells with 293fectinTMTransfection Reagent (#12347-019, Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA). After 24 h of transfection, the cells were loaded onto a microfluidic plate (M04S-03-5PK, Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The microfluidic plates were controlled by a CellASIC ONIX2 Microfluidic System (CAX2-S0000, Millipore). After 48 h of transfection, the culture medium was replaced with an imaging medium containing FluoroBriteTMDMEM (#A1896701, Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 1% GlutaMAXTMSupplement (#35050061, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The imaging medium continuously flowed at 5 psi (“psi” is a unit of pressure) while heating at 37°C by a temperature-controllable manifold (CAX2-MXT20, Millipore). For hyperosmotic shock experiments, 0.5 M sorbitol solution and 0.2 M sodium chloride solution were prepared as follows: 4.5 M sorbitol in DDW and 5 M sodium chloride in DDW were dissolved by the imaging medium, resulting in 0.5 M sorbitol solution and 0.2 M sodium chloride solution, respectively. The transfected cells seeded on microfluidic plates were time-lapse imaged under the imaging medium condition every 10 sec for 2 min. The imaging medium continuously flowed at 1 psi while heating at 37°C. Then, 0.5 M sorbitol solution or 0.2 M sodium chloride solution was added, and fluorescence images were acquired every 10 sec for 5 min. The hyperosmotic medium continuously flowed at 5 psi while heating at 37°C. After incubation, the hyperosmotic medium was replaced with the imaging medium, and the cells were observed every 10 sec for 10 min. The imaging medium continuously flowed at 5 psi while heating at 37°C. Cells were imaged with an inverted microscope (IX83, Olympus/Evident, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with an sCMOS camera (ORCA-Fusion BT, Hamamatsu photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan), a spinning disk confocal unit (CSU-W1, Yokogawa Electric Corporation, Musashino, Japan), and diode lasers at a wavelength of 488 nm. An oil immersion objective lens (UPLXAPO100XO, N.A. 1.45, Olympus/Evident) was used. The excitation laser and fluorescence filter settings were as follows: excitation laser, 488 nm; dichroic mirror (DM), 405/488/561 nm; and emission filters, 500–550 nm. During the observation, the cells were incubated with microfluidic plates at 37°C. The microscope was controlled by MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA). Fluorescence imaging for quantifying expression levels HeLa cells carrying the doxycycline-inducible expression cassette of CAHS1, 3, 8, 12-mEGFP or mEGFP were seeded on a 96-well plate (#167008, Thermo Fisher Scientific). One day after seeding, the cells were treated with the indicated concentration of doxycycline, and 24 h after doxycycline treatment, the cells were observed with a fluorescence microscope. The cells were imaged with an inverted microscope (IX81, Olympus/Evident) equipped with a cooled CCD camera (Retiga 4000R, Photometrics, Tucson, AZ, USA), an excitation light source (Spectra-X light engine, Lumencor Inc., Beaverton, OR, USA), a laser-based autofocus system (IX2-ZDC, Olympus/Evident), a controller for filter wheels and XY stage (MAC5000, Ludl Electronic Products, Hawthorne, NY, USA), and an incubation chamber (STXG-IX3WX, Tokai Hit, Fujinomiya, Japan). An objective lens (UPlanApo 10x, N.A. 0.40, Olympus/Evident) was used. For EGFP imaging, a 475/28 excitation filter, a 20/80 beamsplitter dichroic mirror (Chroma Technology Corp., Bellows Falls, VT, Japan), and a 542/27 emission filter (Semrock, IDEX Health & Science, LLC, West Henrietta, NY, USA) were used. During the observation, live cells were incubated in a stage incubator containing 5% CO2at 37°C. The microscope was controlled by MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices). Cell viability assay and cell death assay HeLa cells were plated on 96-well plates (7.5 × 102– 3.0 × 103cells/well) (#167425, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and cultured in the assay medium for 24 h. To induce gene expression, the cells were treated with doxycycline for 24 h, followed by the treatment with sorbitol solution for 24 h. For the simultaneous cell viability assay and cell death assay (Fig. 2), half of the cell supernatant was used for the water-soluble tetrazolium (WST)-1 assay with a Premix WST-1 Cell Proliferation Assay System (#MK400, TaKaRa, Otsu, Japan) and the other half for the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay with an LDH Cytotoxicity Detection Kit (#MK401, TaKaRa) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Both the WST-1 and LDH release assays were evaluated based on absorbance at 450 nm (and 620 nm as a control) using a microplate reader (#51119000, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The absorbance values obtained from the microplate reader were exported and analyzed by Python (ver. 3.7.3). First, the absorbance values were subtracted from the value obtained from the well containing only the assay medium. Second, the subtracted values were normalized by the following equation: whereYis the normalized value,Xis the experimental data, andHighandLoware the highest and lowest values of the data obtained on the same day, respectively. For the cell viability assay inFig. 2, the High and Low values were obtained from the maximum and minimum values on the same day, respectively. InFig. 3, where the bulk population cell lines were used, the High and Low values were obtained from the value of the well in the absence of sorbitol and the minimum values on the same day, respectively. For the cell death assay, the High and Low values were taken from the value using Triton X-100 treated cells and the lowest values on the same day, respectively. Of note, the absolute number of cells seeded on the well plate varied between experiments, even though the number of cells was counted and the same number of cells were seeded between experiments. Therefore, the “High” and “Low” values were changeable. In addition, the LDH assay requires the supernatant to be taken from each well. These factors and procedures would cause the large variation between experiments. The normalized values were used to generate maps using the seaborn library in Python (Figs. 2D,3B,S1,S2andS3). The normalized data were fitted with the following functions using the scipy.optimize.corve_fit in Python: whereWST(x)andLDH(x)are the fitted WST and LDH values,xis the sorbitol concentration, max and min are the maximum and minimum values,nis the Hill coefficient, andIC50andEC50are the half inhibitory concentration and half effective concentration for cell viability and cell death, respectively. Structure prediction by AlphaFold2 The predicted structures of CAHS1, CAHS3, CAHS8, and CAHS12 were obtained from the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database (https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/). Direct links are as follows: CAHS1 (https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/entry/J7M799), CAHS3 (https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/entry/J7M3T1), CAHS8 (https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/entry/A0A1D1UQN2), and CAHS12 (https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/entry/A0A1D1VNN8). Hyperosmotic stress-induced changes in the subcellular localization of CAHS, LEAM, and MAHS proteins in HeLa cells We examined changes in the subcellular localization of anhydrobiosis-related proteins inR. varieornatusinduced by hyperosmotic stress, which is thought to be an early step in anhydrobiosis. Six types of proteins, including CAHS1, CAHS3, CAHS8, and CAHS12, mitochondrial LEA (LEAM), and mitochondrial abundant heat soluble (MAHS), were separately expressed as mEGFP-fused protein in HeLa cells (Fig. 1A). We selected CAHS1, CAHS3, CAHS8, and CAHS12 because they reversibly form different types of aggregates in response to osmotic stimulation (Tanakaet al., 2022;Yagi-Utsumiet al., 2021), but their roles in osmotic stress resistance have not been investigated except for CAHS3 (Tanakaet al., 2022). The cells were loaded into a microfluidic chamber for rapid osmolyte solution perfusion. One day after loading into the microfluidic chamber, the cells were imaged with a spinning disk conformal microscope to visualize the subcellular distribution of these fusion proteins upon hyperosmotic stress such as 0.5 M sorbitol or 0.2 M NaCl (Fig. 1B). Of note, NaCl is the principal determinant of tonicity of the extracellular fluid (Burget al., 2007). However, cell membranes are permeable to Na+, and elevated chloride specifically increases the expression of α-Na+-K+-ATPase (Capassoet al., 2003). For this reason, poorly permeating organic solutes like sorbitol, mannitol, or raffinose are often used to produce hypertonicity (Burget al., 2007). CAHS1 expression renders HeLa cells resistant to hyperosmotic stress Expression of CAHS1, CAHS3, or CAHS8 confers osmotic stress resistance to HeLa cells Finally, we investigated the structure of the CAHS proteins in AlphaFold (Jumperet al., 2021;Varadiet al., 2022), and found that CAHS1, CAHS3, CAHS8, and CAHS12 all share a single long α-helix and intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) at the N- and C-termini (Fig. 4); CAHS3 and CAHS12 have a predicted structure at the N-terminus, but their confidence is low. Despite the close structural similarity between CAHS proteins, the subcellular localization of these CAHS proteins under high osmotic pressure differed from each other (Fig. 1). As shown in the previous report, CAHS3 shows a coiled-coil structure and forms a fibrous structure, thereby stabilizing the cell structure and increasing the resistance to high osmotic pressure (Tanakaet al., 2022). We have demonstrated that CAHS1 and CAHS8 localize to granules, plasma membrane, and nuclear membrane at high osmotic pressure (Fig. 1), suggesting that CAHS1 and CAHS8 may protect organelles such as plasma membrane and nuclear membrane from hyperosmotic stimuli. These diverse aggregation patterns of CAHS proteins may coordinate anhydrobiosis in tardigrades. The predicted structure of CAHS1, CAHS3, CAHS8, and CAHS12 The predicted structure of CAHS1 (A), CAHS3 (B), CAHS8 (C), and CAHS12 (D) by AlphaFold2 are shown.
