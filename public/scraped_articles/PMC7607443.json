Recent studies in human (i.e., NASA Twin Study,Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019) and mammalian systems (rodent missions,Beheshti et al., 2019;Ronca et al., 2019) are paving the way to understand the effects of the microgravity environment on human physiology, but human life in space will rely on the essential role of plants in bioregenerative life support systems (Zabel et al., 2016), not only as a source of water, food, and removal of CO2but also by providing a terrestrial-like environment for the psychological well-being of astronauts. Due to their sessile condition, plants have to promote adaptive responses to cope with changes in environmental conditions. Light plays multiple roles in the mechanisms of these adaptive responses. On the one hand, light is the source of energy by means of photosynthesis and regulates indirectly cell proliferation and cell growth via the central regulator TOR kinase through the expression of S-phase genes, and also ribosome biogenesis (Caldana et al., 2013;Xiong et al., 2013;Sablowski and Carnier Dornelas, 2014). In addition, light is a major driver in the establishment of the patterns of plant growth and development, by means of phototropism and photomorphogenesis. In playing this role, light is associated with gravity as one of the major tropistic cues, such that gravitropism and phototropism (and the interaction between them) are essential modulators of plant development (Vandenbrink et al., 2014). At the cellular and molecular levels, plant development relies on the activity of cell growth and proliferation taking place in the meristems, which supply differentiated cells and are influenced by the tropistic cues (Perrot-Rechenmann, 2010). However, red light has a stimulating effect on ribosome biogenesis and cell proliferation. An increase in the mitotic index, in the expression of some regulators of these processes at both gene expression and protein levels, and in post-translational modifications of some protein factors has been described in plants irradiated with red light (Tong et al., 1997;Reichler et al., 2001). The absence of gravity (weightlessness, or microgravity, as it exists in free-fall, or in spaceflight) is also, by itself, a stress condition for plants, and specifically for the functions of meristematic cells (Matía et al., 2010;Boucheron-Dubuisson et al., 2016). An experiment performed in the International Space Station (ISS) in whichArabidopsis thalianaseedlings grew for 4 days in darkness resulted in an increase in the rate of cell proliferation and a decrease in the cell growth rate, estimated by the activity of ribosome biogenesis in the nucleolus, compared with the 1gcontrol (Matía et al., 2010). As the coordination of these two activities defines meristematic competence, the effect of the lack of tropistic stimuli, particularly of gravity signals, may result in serious alterations of the developmental pattern of the plant, as was also shown in simulated microgravity experiments (Boucheron-Dubuisson et al., 2016). The Seedling Growth (SG) experiments, recently performed in the ISS, aimed at unraveling the link between phototropism and gravitropism, using the weightless environment of spaceflight (Vandenbrink et al., 2019;Herranz et al., 2019). In the first SG experiment,A. thalianaseedlings corresponding to wild-type (WT) ecotypeLandsberg erecta(Ler) and two phytochrome mutants (phyAandphyB) known to be involved in phototropism (Kiss et al., 2003;Molas and Kiss, 2008) were grown in space for 6 days and photostimulated for the last 2 days, revealing differential blue and red light phototropism in space (Vandenbrink et al., 2016). The analysis of the expression of regulatory genes of cell cycle and ribosome biogenesis showed that red light irradiation produced a significant reversion of the uncoupling of cell proliferation and cell growth caused by microgravity in darkness (Matía et al., 2010) and, consequently, a compensation of the loss of meristematic competence (Valbuena et al., 2018). Briefly, ribosome biogenesis consists of the transcription of 45S rRNA genes (45S rDNA) containing the sequences of 18S, 5.8S, and 25S rRNAs, followed by the multi-step cleavage of 45S pre-rRNA to produce, in association with 5S rRNA and ribosomal proteins (RPs), the mature ribosomal subunits, which are then exported to the cytoplasm and assembled as mature ribosomes. In addition to RPs, hundreds of non-ribosomal proteins (NRPs), or nucleolar proteins and small nucleolar RNAs are required for ribosome biogenesis, playing regulatory roles (Sáez-Vásquez and Delseny, 2019). Among NRPs, nucleolin is the most abundant protein of the nucleolus, where it plays a key role in the different steps involved in ribosome biogenesis, including RNA polymerase (Pol) I transcription, processing of pre-rRNA (Ginisty et al., 1999;Roger et al., 2003), and assembly and nucleocytoplasmic transport of ribosome particles (Bouvet et al., 1998). Moreover, nucleolin has been even implicated in other functions, with or without collateral relationship with ribosome biogenesis (Angelov et al., 2006;Ma et al., 2007;Mongelard and Bouvet, 2007;Stepiński, 2012). Animal and yeast genomes encode a single nucleolin gene, whereas plants offer various examples of gene multiplicity. InA. thaliana, two genes encoding nucleolin proteins have been described:NUC1andNUC2(Pontvianne et al., 2007,2010). TheNUC1gene is highly and ubiquitously expressed in normal growth conditions and NUC1 protein is required to inhibitNUC2gene expression at the transcriptional level and may also influence the accumulation of NUC2 protein. In contrast,NUC2is a functional protein-coding gene developmentally controlled in most plant tissues and organs (Durut et al., 2014). NUC1 and NUC2 proteins localize in the nucleolus. Disruption ofNUC1gene (nuc1-2mutant) leads to severe defects in plant growth and development. At the molecular level, this mutant producesNUC2expression, nucleolus disorganization, rDNA (NOR) heterochromatin decondensation, pre-rRNA accumulation, de-repression of specific rDNA variants, and de-methylation of some sequences of rDNA (Pontvianne et al., 2010). In contrast, disruption ofNUC2gene (nuc2-2mutant) has much weaker effects. Thenuc2-2mutant seedlings grow quite similarly to WT plants, but flowering occurs later. Knockout of theNUC2gene induces expression of some rDNA variants and hypermethylation of some sequences of pre-rRNA. In addition, NUC2 is required for the stability of rDNA variants' copy number (Durut et al., 2014). Overall Transcriptional Profile Effects Confirm a Suitable Quality of Plant Material and Clustering of the Replicates Two environmental conditions (light) are compared here, both of them as part of the SG Earth control reference experiment using the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS). Seedlings were germinated in the same spaceflight hardware during 4 days with a day/night cycle of illumination, and then half of the samples were exposed to 2 days of darkness and the other group to 2 days of continuous red light (Figure 1A). After 6 days growth in the culture chamber (CC), the experiment was completed and the phenotypes of the three mutants were observed (Figure 1B,Supplemental Information,Figure S1). Seedling growth was homogeneous within each cassette, with clearly smaller seedlings in the case of thenuc1-2mutant. No clear phenotypical differences were observed in the root system physiology between darkness- and red light-stimulated samples (including the absence of red phototropism at 1gconditions). The phenotype was compared with a previous experiment with the same duration and genotypes but in petri dishes and with a 6-day photoperiod illumination profile (Manzano et al., 2020submitted). Despite the effects of the TROPI cassette volume, the overall phenotype of the seedlings is also very similar in both studies. The Seedling Growth 2 Ground Reference Experiment (B) Images of 6-day-old seedlings (WildType,nuc1-2,andnuc2-2,under the two illumination options) inside the CC just before collection for freezing (additional photos are provided asSupplemental InformationFigure S1). Scale bar, 1 cm (the gridded membrane has clearly defined grid lines spaced at 3.1 mm). The labels on the membrane represent the cassette # in the ground control. The quality of the replicates and overall similarities among the illumination regimes and different plants used is shown by principal-component analysis (PCA,Figure 1C andSupplemental Information,Data S1). First, a clear difference between the transcriptional profile of the WT,nuc1-2,andnuc2-2plants exposed to darkness or red light photostimulation during the last 2 days of growth is shown by principal component 1 (PC1). Second, the differences between the genotypes can be observed in principal component 2 (PC2), where thenuc1-2genotype has the most disrupted nucleolus phenotype, in that thenuc2-2mutant is closer to the WT. The effect is clearer in the dark samples, because the red light stimulation produces more similarities among the three genotypes. Last, all the biological replicates included in the study cluster together according to the experimental condition, strengthening the statistical validity of the study. The use of three biological replicates (including up to 10 seedlings each) is enough considering the difficulties in increasing this number due to the availability of spaceflight research capabilities. Global Effect of Red Light Photostimulation Differs in EachArabidopsis thalianaLine To understand the effect of the two lighting regimes (red light and darkness) on the transcriptional status, we compared seedlings with the differential illumination during the last 2 days of the plant growth period for each of the lines used (WT,nuc1-2,andnuc2-2). The number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the WT is 1,428 genes, of which 1,067 have their expression activated and 361 have it repressed. In thenuc1-2mutant, the total number of DEGs is lower (1,001), mainly at the expense of the up-regulated genes (633 are over-expressed and 368 are repressed). The number of DEGs from the comparison (red light versus darkness) in thenuc2-2mutant is very similar as in the WT: a total of 1,017 up-regulated genes and 339 down-regulated genes, making a total of 1,365 DEGs (Figure 2). Differentially Expressed Genes (DEG p adj<0.05, Red Light Photostimulation versus Darkness) in WT and Nucleolin Mutants (nuc1-2andnuc2-2) (A) Venn diagram comparing all DEGs and the five most significant gene ontology (GO Enrichment) categories in the common DEG in the three genotypes. (B) Venn diagram comparing up-regulated DEGs and the five most significant gene ontology (GO Enrichment) categories in the common DEGs in the WT andnuc2-2genotypes and in the three genotypes, respectively. (C) Venn diagram comparing down-regulated DEGs and the five most significant gene ontology (GO Enrichment) categories from common DEGs in the three genotypes. Venn diagrams illustrate the group of DEGs that is affected in a single genotype or shared by others (Figure 2). Red light up-regulated genes affected only 298 genes in the WT, 134 genes innuc1-2mutant, and 199 genes fornuc2-2mutant. On the other hand, the WT has 34 up-regulated genes in common withnuc1-2but a large collection of 353 genes in common withnuc2-2(note that the total number of up-regulated genes common for the three genotypes is 382), and only 83 genes for both nucleolin mutants (Figure 2B). Among DEGs down-regulated by the red light compared with the dark, there is a similar number of unique DEGs for each of them; 139 genes for the WT, 142 genes for thenuc1-2mutant, and 104 genes for thenuc2-2mutant. In this case, the number of DEGs down-regulated in the three lines is 125 genes, without any of the pair comparisons reaching that level (thenuc1-2andnuc2-2mutants have 44 and 53 genes in common with WT, respectively, whereas the two nucleolin mutants share 57 down-regulated genes,Figure 2C). A complementary functional analysis has been done using the full lists of up- or down-regulated genes in each genotype, obtained by means of a Heatmap GO Enrichment. Up-regulated gene lists reveal that red light photostimulation versus darkness mainly leads to an unequivocal activation of genes involved in different phases of photosynthesis, together with processes that involve external encapsulation, secondary metabolism, and drug catabolism in all threeA. thalianalines examined (Supplemental Information,Figure S2A). Other significantly affected categories are the GO involving cell wall modification, pathogenesis, responses to insects, and defense mechanisms to bacteria. In addition to the mentioned GO groups, red light activates different biosynthetic processes (ketone, cutin, and small molecules) and the response to stimuli, such as cold and UV light, in the WT andnuc2-2mutant lines. Solely in the WT line, an enrichment in cell division-related genes (microtubule-based movement, cell cycle, meiotic cell cycle) is produced. In the case of down-regulated GO groups, red light photostimulation reduces expression of genes involved in the response to different stimuli (temperature, hypoxia, light, abscisic acid, oxidative stress) as well as the circadian rhythm of plants (Supplemental Information,Figure S2B). Additional down-regulated genes involved in the response to stress appear in WT andnuc2-2comparison (heat and osmotic stress), in the WT andnuc1-2comparison (cold acclimation, response to karrikin, hormone metabolism, and cell wall modification), ornuc1-2only (response to gibberellin). The two nucleolin mutant lines share a repression of the amino acid metabolism (alpha-amino acid catabolic process and leucine degradation). Dissecting Transcriptional Status for Each Genotype for Illumination Conditions at Normal Earth Gravity To better understand the differences in the transcriptional status of each genotype that could be attributed to the illumination conditions designed to be used in the SG spaceflight experiment, we performed a series of comparisons between the different lines, namely,nuc1-2versus WT,nuc2-2versus WT, andnuc1-2versusnuc2-2,when they are either photostimulated with red light or kept in darkness for 48 h, after a growth period of 4 days under a 16 h/8 h white light photoperiod regime (regular growth condition). The total number of DEGs when comparing the severe mutantnuc1-2with the WT is remarkable, with thousands of genes affected in the different illumination conditions. A similar result was obtained in the comparison ofnuc1-2withnuc2-2.This number was much higher in the comparisons of thenuc1-2mutant with both the Col-0 andnuc2-2mutant in darkness: 3,363 genes and 2,121 genes, respectively. Under red light stimulation, the numbers dropped to half: 1,499 genes compared with the WT and 1,069 compared withnuc2-2,respectively. In contrast, the small number of DEGs between the WT andnuc2-2mild mutant (just 149 genes in darkness conditions) peaked to 225 when red light photostimulation was provided (Figure 3). The up- and down-regulated genes showed similar trends in this case (Supplemental Information,Figure S3). Differentially Expressed Genes (DEG p adj<0.05, in the Three Genotype Pair-Comparisons among WT,nuc1-2,andnuc2-2) within the Same Experimental Condition (A) Venn diagram comparing all DEGs between plants exposed to darkness the last 2 days. (B) Venn diagram comparing all DEGs between plants exposed to red light stimulation the last 2 days. The differential numbers in DEGs can be assigned to particular GO groups. Ontology analysis shows that both comparisons involving thenuc1mutant in the darkness produced an increase in the expression of genes mainly involved in cell division, such as cell cycle, meiotic cell cycle, microtubule cytoskeleton, nuclear chromosome segregation, cytokinesis, and cell cycle-G2/M transition (Supplemental Information,Figure S4A). Furthermore, in thenuc1-2versus WT andnuc1-2versusnuc2-2comparisons, categories of responses to different stimuli, namely, responses to auxin, red light, gravity, and UV and ionizing radiations, also appeared overrepresented. In the comparisonnuc1-2versusnuc2-2in darkness, most functional categories (GO terms) appearing up-regulated in thenuc1-2mutant are related to the cell wall (cell wall macromolecule catabolic process, pectin biosynthetic process), the cuticle (cuticle development and cutin, suberin, and wax biosyntheses), and the plasma membrane (anchored component of plasma membrane, very-long-chain fatty acid biosynthetic process, transmembrane receptor protein kinase activity). The up-regulated processes when red light is applied are quite different (Supplemental Information,Figure S4B). In thenuc1-2versus WT andnuc1-2versusnuc2-2comparisons, DEGs appeared involved in cell wall (structural constituents of cell wall) and in development (positive regulation of growth, post-embryonic plant morphogenesis, cellular response to ethylene stimulus). In thenuc1-2versusnuc2-2comparison, many genes with a red-light-activated expression were involved in ribosome biogenesis (preribosome, maturation of SSU-rRNA, 90S preribosome, maturation of 5.8S RNA, ribosomal large subunit biogenesis). The two nucleolin mutant lines relative to WT (nuc1-2versus WT andnuc2-2versus WT comparisons) in conditions of red light photoactivation have up-regulated genes involved in different response processes, such as the responses to hypoxia, drug, antibiotic, salicylic acid, and wounding. The number of response processes was increased in thenuc2-2versus WT comparison with the GO categories: responses to cold, bacterium, and abscisic acid. The identification of common gene categories down-regulated in both darkness and red light conditions was more challenging (Supplemental Information,Figures S4C and S4D). In darkness,nuc1-2versus WT andnuc1-2versusnuc2-2comparisons were very similar and mainly related to developmental processes (regulation post-embryonic development, meristem development, regulation of seed development, plant organ senescence), mRNA quality (mRNA surveillance pathway), response to temperature (response to temperature stimulus, endopeptidase Clp complex, heat shock protein), and immune system (immune response, response to toxic substance, glutathione metabolism). In the comparisons indicated above, genes involved in long-day photoperiodism, flowering, rhythmic process, and response to light intensity were also less represented. In the same way, cellular responses to light stimulus category was over-represented in both nucleolin mutants with respect to WT and responses to light stimulus was a common GO category in all three comparisons. The gene categories repressed only in thenuc1-2versusnuc2-2comparison were involved in the spliceosome, protein demethylation, chromatin organization, mRNA binding, and histone acetyltransferase activity. The gene categories with repressed expression under red light for any of the comparisons (nuc1-2versusWTandnuc1-2versusnuc2-2) were related to mRNA splicing (alternative mRNA splicing via spliceosome), light responses (response to light stimulus, photoperiodism flowering, circadian rhythm), photosynthesis (chlorophyll biosynthesis process, chloroplast envelope), and the immune system (immune system process, defense response to bacterium, regulation of salicylic acid metabolic process,Supplemental Information,Figure S4D). Protein-Protein Interaction Network ofNuc1-2Differential Response under Darkness Conditions Major constraints of spaceflight experiments are the reduced amount of material and reproducibility, but other issues include the storage of samples before and after the experiment execution in space, causing staggered preparation and processing of the samples (Millar et al., 2010;Correll et al., 2013). In this work, we have shown that, using the spaceflight hardware and procedures, we can perform a transcriptomic analysis with enough reliability to describe the differential transcriptional state of the nucleolin mutants under different light conditions. Three replicates could be considered low for current standards for animal -omics studies in Earth, but in our experiment each replica already represents the average of 10 plants. We show here that the replicates expected to be collected from the spaceflight experiment can be estimated to be sufficient for performing a sequencing study that allows clustering of the different genotypes and environmental conditions (Figure 1). Due to logistical considerations, a specific constraint for plant space biology is the limited number of different mutants/genotypes that can be used in a spaceflight experiment in true microgravity. We have to be sure that the mutants of choice will provide valuable information. In that sense, the use of nucleolin mutants is a promising choice to provide insight into both the cell cycle and stress response mechanisms, apart from the ribosome biogenesis in which this protein is directly involved. These processes are known to be recurrently affected in space -omics experiments with plants (Choi et al., 2019;Ferl et al., 2015;Herranz et al., 2019;Johnson et al., 2017;Kruse et al., 2017;Paul et al., 2013,2017). The analysis performed here allows us to know the specific functions assumed by the two nucleolin proteins ofA. thaliana(NUC1 and NUC2) in different environmental conditions, such as red light photostimulation and darkness, affecting tropistic stimuli. This information can be considered as the 1greference control required to obtain the best possible understanding of the changes produced by the spaceflight conditions on plant development, and how the gravitational stress could be counteracted by changing phototropic stimuli. A longer-term goal is to use this knowledge for plant cultivation into bioregenerative life support systems. The Transcriptomic Baseline for Nucleolin Mutants Is Different under Red Light Photostimulation and Darkness Red light illumination mainly produces the activation of genes involved in photosynthesis, cell wall modification, drug catabolism, pathogenesis, and biotic stress response. Conversely, different abiotic stimuli responses (temperature, hypoxia, light, abscisic acid, oxidative stress) are down-regulated by the photostimulation treatment, as well as the circadian rhythm of plants. This transcriptional effect is similar in the three lines studied (Col-0 WT,nuc1-2,andnuc2-2), suggesting that it may be independent of the nucleolin protein functions. Therefore, the interpretation of transcriptional effects on plants' grown during spaceflight will be straightforward. In contrast, red light illumination produces a down-regulation of genes involved in the response to karritin, cold acclimation, and hormone metabolism in WT andnuc1-2, indicating that the NUC2 protein, and/or other proteins up-regulated innuc1-2(Pontvianne et al., 2007), could participate in these functions. In addition, in thenuc1-2mutant, genes coding for response to gibberellin with the red light appear repressed. Gibberellin is a hormone involved in seed germination, bud and fruit formation, shoot longitudinal growth, and axial organ elongation (Hedden and Sponsel, 2015), which could support the relationship of defective plant growth and development withNUC1gene disruption. Differential Role of Nucleolin Mutants' Transcriptomic Baseline May Offer New Insight in Spaceflight Experiments Differential transcriptional response is observed when comparing the two nucleolin mutants. The categories of genes activated differentially in both mutants (nuc1-2versusnuc2-2comparison) are mainly involved in the cell wall and membrane systems. This finding is potentially interesting in space -omics to discriminate gravitropism from graviresistance mechanisms (Herranz and Medina, 2014) and could be related to the phenotype described in thenuc1-2mutant, in which a reduction in the cell number and a disorganization in every cell layer is observed in transversal sections of primary leaves (Pontvianne et al., 2007). Moreover, the gene categories repressed only in the above-mentioned comparison are involved in the spliceosome, protein demethylation, chromatin organization, mRNA binding, and histone acetyltransferase activity, which could be related to the described antagonist activity of these two proteins in pre-rRNA methylation and with their role in chromatin remodeling, RNA Pol I transcription, mRNA stability, and RNA/DNA metabolism (Pontvianne et al., 2010;Durut et al., 2014). Due to logistical constraints, this study lacks a continuously illuminated control set of samples performed simultaneously due to the absence of those samples in the spaceflight experiment as well as the reference experiment. The next step in this research is to analyze the samples from the space experiment in microgravity and the partial gravity conditions produced by the centrifuge in the EMCS on the ISS. We anticipate confirming that the duplicated nucleolin gene system works during spaceflight will lead us to discover novel mechanisms for plant adaptation to spaceflight conditions. Thus, this research will be eventually translated into better crops for life support systems in the human spaceflight ventures of the 21st century.
