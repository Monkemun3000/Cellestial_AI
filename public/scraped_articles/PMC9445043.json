Subject terms:Plant sciences, Cell biology The plant vacuole is a large essential organelle in plant cells and is important for cell elongation, recycling, and storage, among many other functions16–18. Vacuole enlargement is concomitant with cell growth along the developmental gradient represented by the longitudinal axis of the root. Vacuole enlargement along this gradient requires homotypic membrane fusion, which is mediated by two conserved complexes, the homotypic vacuole protein sorting (HOPS) and soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE)19. Both HOPS and the vacuolar SNARE complexes have vacuole or pre-vacuole-specific subunits that provide specificity to membrane fusion. The vacuolar SNARE complex is formed by SYP22, VTI11, SYP51, and either VAMP72720or VAMP713/VAMP71121–23. A loss of function allele of VTI11,zigzag1(zig-1), has fragmented vacuoles and showed abnormal shoot gravitropism24–26. Thezig-1mutant also has short hypocotyls, small and wrinkled rosette leaves and a zigzag-shaped stem24,25. Wortmannin (WM), a chemical inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), can induce vacuole fusion inzig-1and partially restore its agravitropic shoot phenotype26,27. WM-induced vacuole fusion inzig-1is fast and almost complete vacuole fusion can be observed in roots within two hours26,27. Given the large size of the vacuole in plant cells and the efficiency of WM at inducing its fusion, this treatment represents a unique assay for the study of organelle fusion in plants in space. Plant specimens have been sent to space for fundamental biology research since the 1960s1,3,28and this resulted in the design of specific hardware for optimal growth3,29. The Biological Research in Canister-Petri Dish Fixation Unit (BRIC-PDFU) is a fully contained hardware that has been used extensively with small plant seedlings9,30–32and it is suitable for chemical treatments in space. Previous experiments involved storing liquid media or fixative solution inside the chamber of the PDFU for microbial culture or plant tissue fixation33–35. Cell biology research on the ISS requires sample fixation to preserve cell morphology. Chemical fixation in the ISS has been accomplished with non-coagulant agents such as formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde9but the latter has high levels of autofluorescence36. Direct fluorescence microscopy of fluorescent proteins from fixed tissues37,38is an effective approach to extract quantitative information of cell structure at high samples size, but the viability of fluorescence microscopy of tissues fixed in space has not been demonstrated given the challenges imposed by the BRIC hardware. Here, we took advantage of the WM-induced vacuole fusion inzig-1to study the effect of microgravity on plant vacuole fusion. Formaldehyde-based tissue fixation in the BRIC-PDFU hardware was used and GFP-tagged vacuoles were imaged post-flight by confocal microscopy. We detected a mild but significant decrease in plant vacuole fusion inzig-1that highlights possible effects of microgravity or other spaceflight stresses on vacuole biogenesis and membrane fusion. This experiment also demonstrates the feasibility of chemical treatment assays on the ISS which may contribute to future cell biology research in this microgravity environment. Optimization of BRIC-24 workflow Fig. 1. Overview of the BRIC-24 experimental workflow. SterilizedArabidopsisseeds (WT andzig-1with GFP-TIP2;1) were plated onto AGM media and stored at 4 °C before BRIC-PDFU integration. Each petri dish contained 30 seeds. Treatment solution (33 μm WM or DMSO buffer) and fixative were injected into the dual chamber of the PDFU. Plates were placed into each PDFUs and PDFUs were integrated into BRICs. Four BRICs were then stored in a cold bag for the flight. After 4 days of growth on the ISS, WM solution or DMSO control were applied to the seedlings. The treatment lasted for 2 hours. The second actuation was conducted by applying fixative solution to the seedlings. BRICs were then kept at 4 °C and returned to NASA after splash down. Confocal imaging and data analysis were conducted at NCSU. Ground tests demonstrated feasibility of the vacuole fusion assay using the BRIC-PDFU Fig. 2.

WM-induced vacuole fusion may be delayed in microgravity The primary goal for this research was to test whether WM can induce vacuole fusion ofzig-1in the microgravity environment of the ISS. For this purpose, all seedlings collected from BRIC-PDFUs of flight assay and ground control were imaged by confocal microscopy for vacuole number analysis. Epidermal and cortical cells within the transition and elongation zones of the root tip were analyzed as changes in vacuole morphology are readily observed in these cell transitions44,45. WT cells had only one vacuole with a few exceptions in the transition zone, regardless of chemical treatment or flight environment (Fig.4). This suggests that the microgravity environment on the ISS does not induce major delays on vacuole biogenesis in the WT.zig-1seedlings showed the typical fragmented vacuole phenotype in both the flight assay and the ground control when the DMSO control treatment was applied (Fig.4). While no differences were observed between flight and ground control in thezig-1transition zone of roots treated with DMSO (Fig.4b, f), a small but significant increase in vacuole number was detected in the elongation zone of flight samples inzig-1(Fig.4d, h). For example, the average vacuole number per cell was 3.27 for ground control and 3.80 for flight assay in the epidermis of the elongation zone. Therefore,zig-1may have an enhancedzig-1phenotype in the microgravity environment of the ISS. Fig. 4. Quantification of WM-induced vacuole fusion. Vacuole morphology (a,c,e,g) and vacuole number (b,d,f,h) of WT andzig-1plants expressing GFP-TIP2;1. Seedlings were grown in ground control or the ISS and treated with DMSO buffer (control) or WM solution. Cells were imaged at the root tip epidermis transition zone (a,b), epidermis elongation zone (c,d), cortex transition zone (e,f) or cortex elongation zone (g,h). Four-day-old seedlings were treated with DMSO buffer control or WM solution for 2 h and then seedlings were fixed and kept in 4 °C before confocal imaging.

Amyloplasts (where arrows point at) were associated with tonoplast (labeled by GFP) in hypocotyl endodermis of WT andzig-1in microgravity environment as on earth. Scale bar: 20 μm. Here, we investigated the effect of microgravity on plant vacuole fusion and the association of vacuoles and plastids. The feasibility of chemical treatments in plants on the ISS was demonstrated using the BRIC-PDFU hardware and an optimized plant fixation protocol. The microgravity environment appears to delay WM-induced vacuole fusion inzig-1root epidermis. The WM fusion assay is an ideal tool for visualization of cellular membrane fusion in fixed tissues in space. We selected the cortex and epidermis from the transition and early elongation zones of the root because while the fragmented vacuole phenotype ofzig-1is present in most cell types, the WM-induced fusion is best visualized in those root cells26,27. Moreover, root cells undergoing the transition between meristem and elongation zones are well-defined stages of vacuole maturation45,52–54. Overall, we found cells from the transition and early elongation zone to be better preserved than the central elongation or the maturation zones. Given the large numbers of seedlings used, this allowed us to obtain quantitative information for this assay. The vacuole number analysis in epidermis and cortex indicated that WM was overall effective at inducing vacuole fusion ofzig-1in microgravity inside the BRIC-PDFU. This result underscores the feasibility of chemical inhibitor treatments in plants grown on the ISS. These experiments, however, also exposed limitations rendered by the PDFU hardware as vacuole fusion was incomplete even in the ground control, unlike similar experiments outside the hardware where almost all thezig-1cells result in having a single vacuole. Given the sealed nature of the PDFU and the mode of actuation, contact of the chemical solution with all the seedlings on the plate may be incomplete and this would be exacerbated by the abnormal movement of liquids under microgravity. Nonetheless, a small but significant delay in WM-induced vacuole fusion was detected in the epidermis of flight-grownzig-1. This result, together with the increased vacuole number in this mutant under microgravity, suggests that microgravity may slow down membrane fusion events in plants but not sufficiently to inhibit growth or be detectable in the WT. This work demonstrated that fixation of fluorescent protein-labeled organelles on the ISS is feasible. Previous cell biology experiments on the ISS relied on tissue fixation followed by electron microscopy9. Fluorescence microscopes have been available at the ISS48,55which allowed the visualization of GFP tagged proteins in plants56, but these have been limited to tissue expression patterns due to the complexity of high-resolution imaging57. Imaging of plant cells with high resolution requires high numerical aperture objectives with short working distances which require specimens be mounted on slides, something that would require a large amount of astronaut time. Therefore, tissue fixation and post-flight microscopy is still the best option for cell biology when large sample numbers are needed. Electron microscopy of fixed samples provides the best cellular and subcellular resolution but is time consuming. We set out to develop effective protocols for the fixation ofArabidopsisseedlings carrying fluorescently tagged proteins such that we could take advantage of the capabilities and efficiency of confocal microscopy. We were able to obtain good quality fixations in both genotypes that allowed us to quantify vacuoles in sufficient seedlings, but it is important to emphasize that the fixation quality was still diminished compared to similar fixation protocols outside the BRIC-PDFU hardware even on earth. Tissue fixation protocols that are compatible with fluorescent proteins have been developed for plants37,38,42,59. These protocols were developed to improve imaging depth within plant tissues by clearing cellular structures. Maintaining subcellular structure and fluorescent protein structure and intensity allow for imaging experiments that are incompatible with live-cell imaging such as those conducted in space. We found that the intensity of GFP and mCherry is retained in fixed seedlings even after long storage in the cold. However, GFP intensity was more sensitive than mCherry to buffer composition. Lower concentration of KPBS buffer reduces the intensity of GFP, suggesting the GFP stability can be altered by the concentration of certain salt. Unfortunately, the morphology of the mCherry-tagged ER was poorly preserved with most fixative solutions. Many aggregates of ER membranes were detected while the fluorescence intensity of the mCherry marker was intact. A similar phenomenon was reported inDrosophilacells carrying a BiP-Superfolder GFP-HDEL fusion that labels the ER. In those cells, chemical fixation disrupted the ER morphology and ER tubules appeared to fragment into discrete puncta60. Preservation of ER structures by chemical fixation may require specific chemical compositions. Arabidopsismaterials and growth conditions Arabidopsisecotype Columbia (Col-0) expressing GFP-TIP2;1 was previously described39and previously transformed27with the HDEL-mCherry construct40. Thezig-1mutant was previously described24, and the GFP-TIP2;1 marker was introgressed into this genotype by crossing. The HDEL-mCherry marker40was separately introduced intozig-1byAgrobacterium-mediated transformation27and the two markers were combined by crossing and selection of plants in the F2. Seeds were surface sterilized and sown on 0.5 XArabidopsisgrowth medium (AGM, 0.5X Murashige and Skoog medium, 10 g/L Gelrite, 1% (w/v) sucrose) in 6 cm diameter petri dishes. Each petri dish contained 30 seeds. Twenty-two Petri dishes were integrated into PDFUs and stored in 4 BRICs for SVT, EVT and flight. BRICs were incubated at 4 °C for 5 days in the dark and transferred to 22 °C growth chamber (SVT, EVT and ground control) or the ISS environment (flight assay) for 3–4 days (Fig.1). Chemical treatments and fixation Three to four-day-old dark-grown seedlings were used for chemical treatments and fixation. WM (SIGMA, cat# W3144) was diluted to 33 μM in AGM and an equal volume of DMSO (Thermo Scientific,D12345) diluted in AGM was used as the control. For lab testing, seedlings were incubated in WM working solution or DMSO buffer control for 1 or 2 h in the dark. If used in the BRIC-PDFU, WM or DMSO were stored in one of the chambers in the PDFU and an actuator tool was used to push each solution onto the petri dish. Optimization of the seedling fixation protocol involved testing different buffers for the PFA fixative. To mimic the mixing process inside the BRIC-PDFU, one volume of 0.5X AGM was mixed with one volume of 8% Paraformaldehyde (PFA, Electron Microscopy Sciences cat# 15700) in the corresponding buffer for a final concentration of 4% PFA. The final concentration for each buffer to test was 0.5X AGM, 0.5X or 0.25X KPBS61, 0.5X or 1X BupHTMPBS (ThermoFisher Scientific cat# 28372), 0.5X or 1X microtubule stabilizing buffer (MTSB)43, 1X Potassium phosphate buffer (PPB) (6.5 mM KH2PO4, 93.5 mM K2HPO4) and 0.25X Sorenson’s buffer62. Seedlings treated with each mixture were immediately stored at 4 °C until confocal microscopy. For SVT, EVT and flight assay, 16% PFA aqueous solutions were diluted to 8% PFA in 0.5X KPBS (SVT) or 1X BupHTMPBS (EVT, flight assay). The final PFA concentration after actuation in the PDFU was around 4% with 0.25X KPBS buffer (SVT) and 0.5X BupHTMPBS buffer (EVT, flight assay). Seedlings were then stored at 4 °C until de-integration of BRIC-PDFU followed by confocal microscopy. Fixed seedlings were washed 3 times for 1 min in sterilized water before imaging. A Zeiss LSM880 confocal microscope was used for all the imaging. The excitation/emission wavelengths for GFP and mCherry were 488 nm/490–561 nm and 561 nm/570–676 nm respectively. The C-Apochromat 40X/1.2 W Korr FCS M27 water-immersion objective was used. All seedlings were imaged at the root tip transition and elongation zones and in both epidermis and/or cortical cells. The transition zone was defined as the region of the root apex where a doubling in cell length was observed in a specific cell layer, corresponding to the boundary between the meristematic and elongation zones63and the cell where that doubling occurred was included in the analysis. Cells in the elongation zone were identified as those past the transition zone. Two to three z sections were captured per sample in each cell layer. Cells where the section was too close to the cell cortex were not included and vacuoles were counted by eye as defined by fluorescently-labelled membrane boundaries. Some seedlings were additionally imaged at the root tip columella and hypocotyl endodermis. For SVT, EVT and the flight assay, seeds germination rate was calculated from the number of recovered seedlings in each PDFU after de-integration. To measure hypocotyl length, fixed seedlings were arranged on glass slides and imaged using digital cameras. Hypocotyl and root length was measured with Fiji64.
