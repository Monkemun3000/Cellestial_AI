Chapes, 1717 Claflin Rd, Manhattan, KS 66502, Telephone: 785-532-6795,skcbiol@ksu.edu For B cell development and specificity, there are a large number of heavy chain (IgH) and kappa light chain (Igκ) gene segments that are used to produce the Ig (antibody) receptor population repertoire (de Bono et al., 2004). This antibody repertoire is quite large and the possible specificities can theoretically exceed the number of actual antibody molecules in the host (Georgiou et al., 2014). In antibodies, the antigen binding region is formed by six complementarity determining regions (CDRs) that loop out from the V region backbone formed by two beta-pleated sheets (Haidar et al., 2014;Saul and Poljak, 1992). The germline V gene segment repertoire is necessary for host responses to pathogens and CDR1 and CDR2 are completely encoded for by variable (V region) gene segments (Lu et al., 2014). Therefore, knowing which V gene segments are utilized is fundamental to understanding B-cell specificity and the development of effective immune responses. The CDR3 of both the heavy and light chains are highly variable due to their unique generation. During the creation of each Ig sequence, partially random splicing between V, D (heavy chain), and J gene segments occurs and random base insertions occur, called “n-nucleotide” additions. One hypothesis is that V gene segments have been maintained in the genome because of their importance in binding specific pathogens and provide essential host defense functions. However, CDR3 may be important because it is highly variable. Its role as a highly diverse and variable region is what provides the essential key to determining antigen specificity (Xu and Davis, 2000). The spaceflight environment can impact many parameters critical to the host immune response. In multiple species spaceflight affects the total body, thymus and spleen mass (Allebban et al., 1996;Chapes et al., 1999;Congdon et al., 1996;Durnova et al., 1976;Grindeland et al., 1990;Grove et al., 1995;Jahns et al., 1992;Nash and Mastro, 1992;Pecaut et al., 2000;Serova, 1980;Udden et al., 1995;Wronski et al., 1998), circulating corticosterone (Blanc et al., 1998;Chapes et al., 1999;Lesnyak et al., 1993;Meehan et al., 1993;Merrill et al., 1992;Stein and Schluter, 1994;Stowe et al., 2001a;Stowe et al., 2001b;Stowe et al., 1999;Wronski et al., 1998), mitogen-induced proliferation, cytokine production and reactivity (Bikle et al., 1994;Chapes et al., 1999;Cogoli et al., 1990;Fuchs and Medvedev, 1993;Gould et al., 1987;Grigoriev et al., 1993;Hughes-Fulford, 1991;Konstantinova et al., 1973;Lesnyak et al., 1996;Lesnyak et al., 1993;Mandel and Balish, 1977;Miller et al., 1995;Nash et al., 1992;Nash and Mastro, 1992;Sonnenfeld et al., 1998;Sonnenfeld et al., 1992;Sonnenfeld et al., 1990;Stein and Schluter, 1994;Taylor and Dardano, 1983;Taylor et al., 1986), and lymphocyte subpopulation distributions (Allebban et al., 1994;Berry, 1970;Ichiki et al., 1996;Meehan et al., 1992;Pecaut et al., 2000;Sonnenfeld et al., 1998;Sonnenfeld et al., 1992). B cells are among the immune components that are affected by spaceflight. The number of B cells in the spleen was reduced in mice flown on the space shuttle flight, STS-35 (Gridley et al., 2009). The percentage of B cells in the bone marrow and spleen also is reduced in mice subjected to hindlimb unloading (Gaignier et al., 2014;Lescale et al., 2015). When rats were injected with sheep red blood cells 8 days prior to an 18.5-day COSMOS flight there were lower IgG concentrations compared to both immunized and non-immunized ground controls after landing (Lesnyak et al., 1993). IgM production was virtually eliminated in lymphocytes stimulatedin vitrowith pokeweed mitogen (PWM) on the International Space Station (ISS) when compared to similarly activated ground controls. Furthermore, when cells were activated on Earth, frozen down, and then put back into suspension in space to assess IgM secretion, Fitzgeraldet al.found that IgM secretion was significantly slower than similarly treated ground-based controls (Fitzgerald et al., 2009). Sample Preparation and RNA Extraction Spleens were removed from four 11-week-old, specific pathogen-free, female C57BL/6J mice housed in the Division of Biology vivarium at Kansas State University. One-half of each spleen was homogenized with a 70 µM sieve to generate a single-cell suspension designated, “cells”. Spleen cells were pelleted at 350 × g and were resuspended in 5 mL of ice-cold ACK lysing buffer (155mM NH4Cl, 10mM KHC03, 0.1mM EDTA) to lyse red blood cells. After five minutes, 10 mL of ice-cold isotonic medium was added to the suspension and cells were again pelleted at 350 × g and the supernatant was removed. The pellet was resuspended in Trizol LS (Ambion, Carlsbad, CA, USA) for RNA extraction. The remaining spleen half was immediately placed into Trizol LS for RNA extraction, and designated “tissue”. RNA extraction was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNAsin (40 units) was added to each RNA aliquot and stored in −80°C. RNA quality was assessed on a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). One microgram of high-quality total RNA was used for RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) library construction using the TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation kit v2 (Illumina, San Diego, CA) with the following modification: one minute fragmentation time was applied to allow for longer RNA fragments. The obtained RNA-seq libraries were analyzed with the 2100 Bioanalyzer. Thetissuesample described previously was then subjected to size selection and designated “size selected”. Selection of sequences 375–900 nucleotides (nt) in length (275–800 nt sequences plus 50 nt sequencing adaptors on each end of the cDNA) was performed using the Pippin Prep system (Sage Science, Beverly, MA, USA). All libraries were then quantified with qPCR according to Illumina recommendations. The sequencing was performed at the Kansas State University Integrated Genomics Facility on the MiSeq personal sequencing system (Illumina) using the 600 cycles MiSeq reagent v3 kit (Illumina) according to Illumina instructions, resulting in 2 × 300 nt reads.

(C) Workflow for MiSeq and HiSeq referenced mapping strategy. Motifs used to determine the constant region of heavy chain Ig sequences. Mapped sequences that were identified using Illumina sequence identification tags and sequences identified multiple times were removed as outlined. MiSeq and HiSeq Genome Mapping NASA RNA Preparation and Sequencing Tissues from two sets of mice were analyzed. The first set of spleens and livers were removed from five 35-week-old female C57BL/6Tac mice aboard the ISS 21–22 days after launch (CASIS Flight, SpaceX-4). Five 35-week old female mice housed in the ISS Environmental Simulator were processed similarly with a four-day delay (CASIS Ground Controls) (Figliozi, 2014). Spleens and livers were placed in RNALater (LifeTechnologies, Carlsbad, CA) for at least 24 hours at 4°C and then stored at −80°C while aboard the ISS, during transport, and upon return to Earth. The second set of tissues were isolated from seven 21-week-old female C57BL/6J were euthanized aboard the ISS 37 days post launch (NASA Flight, SpaceX-4). Carcasses were immediately frozen (−80°C) and after arriving at Earth, were dissected. Livers were preserved in RNALater for at least 24 hours at 4°C and then frozen at −80°C. RNA was extracted from the tissues using Trizol (LifeTechnologies, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The resultant RNA was then processed through an RNeasey mini column (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) as per manufacturer’s instructions. RNA quality was assessed on a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) and stored at −80°C. RNA was sequenced on Illumina HiSeq with single reads of 50nt (1× 50nt). Size Selection Yields Highest Number of Antibody Sequences Most studies of Ig gene-segment use frequency have used single-cell suspensions or sorted to isolate specific cell populations (Aoki-Ota et al., 2012;Collins et al., 2015;Kaplinsky et al., 2014;Kramer et al., 2016;Lu et al., 2014). The advantage of these preparations is the exclusion of extraneous tissues and cells, which can enhance recovery of Ig sequences.

Application of MiSeq Workflow to RR1 HiSeq Data Mapping techniques were compared by assessing the correlation of Vκ usage between multiple HiSeq and Miseq datasets. HiSeq datasets included sequencing data from CASIS and NASA ground (G) or flight (F) RR1 mice. The comparison groups are as follows: Vκ gene segment usage from reference-mapped HiSeq data versus Vκ gene segment usage of MiSeq sample preparation datasets. Vκ gene segment usage from genome-mapped HiSeq data versus Vκ gene segment usage of MiSeq sample preparation datasets. Vκ gene segment usage from reference-mapped HiSeq Data versus Vκ gene segment usage of genome-mapped HiSeq data. (A) Linear regression of median VH gene segment usage from genome and reference mappings. R2=0.9973, p<0.0001. (B) Linear Regression of median Vκ gene segment usage from genome and reference mapping. R2=0.9923, p<0.0001. In an effort to reduce Illumina bias towards short reads seen in the cells and tissue treatment groups, ten months later, we sequenced the same tissue total RNA using size selection. This extended storage time after initial sequencing and additional freeze/thaw cycles are likely the cause of reduced numbers of post-cleaning reads due to RNA degradation. Nevertheless, the size-selected data set still provided the highest number of productive and unknown antibodies. Subsequent preparations have verified that size selection is helpful in providing the highest number of antibody sequences (data not shown). Therefore, we have chosen to include size selection in our protocol for NGS assessment of Ig V-gene usage. We also compared our data to Igκ gene family usage. Aoki-Ota assessed skewed Vκ gene segment usage and V-J gene segment usage in unimmunized C57BL/6 mice using primer amplified total RNA of B cells from spleen, bone marrow and lymph node using 454 pyrosequencing (Aoki-Ota et al., 2012). Their sequencing data was analyzed using the NCBI basic local alignment tool with reference sequences for Vκ and Jκ obtained from the IMGT data base. The top seven V gene segments identified in their study were also found to be among the most abundant Vκ gene segments in all of our treatment groups. Additionally, V-J pairing of their top gene segments paralleled our data. Lu examined the effects of primer bias and mouse to mouse variation in Vκ- and Jκ-gene segments and CDR3 regions using primer amplified total RNA isolates of Balb/c splenic B cells on the 454 pyrosequencing platform (Lu et al., 2014). As with our study, sequencing reads were submitted to the IMGT HighV-quest tool, however, only functionally productive immunoglobulins were used in their analysis (Lu et al., 2014). In spite of the strain differences between our studies, of the Vκ-gene segments representing over one-percent of the antibody repertoire reported by Luet al., at least 80% of those gene segments appearing at a frequency 0.5% or higher in our analyses. Although there was not 100% agreement among our study and the others, there was a high degree of consistency. Variations in data may result from sequencing and tissue isolation techniques and natural variation among animals, including mouse strain. In addition, since we did not amplify for IgV gene segments, we likely may have missed rarer B cell clones. Primer biases in other studies may have also contributed to some of the differences. Nevertheless, it is clear that our approach provided an unbiased, representative sample of actively transcribing B cells.
