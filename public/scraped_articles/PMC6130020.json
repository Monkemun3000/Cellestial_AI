Received 2018 Jun 11; Accepted 2018 Jul 4; Issue date 2018 Sep. ANN1 and ANN2 regulate Arabidopsis primary root growth by facilitating post-phloem transport of sugar in root tips. Annexins are multifunctional proteins that have been found in all plants and vertebrate species. Their tertiary structure with calcium-binding domains is evolutionarily conserved in all species (Morgan et al., 2004,2006;Konopka-Postupolska et al., 2011;Clark et al., 2012). In plants, annexins have been localized in many parts of the cell, including the plasma membrane, the Golgi apparatus, secretory vesicles, vacuolar membranes, and the nucleus. Certain annexins are also found in the extracellular matrix as secreted proteins. Plant annexins are expressed in all stages of plant growth and development. Recently,Thieme et al. (2015)found that some Arabidopsis annexin transcripts can be transported across the whole plant by phloem sap. Annexin proteins have also been identified in the phloem sap of several different plant species (Kehr, 2006), and in Arabidopsis, ANN1 was found in phloem exudate of rosette leaves (Guelette et al., 2012). Immunolocalization of a pea annexin protein in young developing sieve elements led to the suggestion that annexins may play a role in phloem cell development (Clark et al., 1992). In situ transcript localization studies found thatANN1is expressed in phloem and phloem parenchyma in Arabidopsis seedlings (Clark et al., 2001). However, the physiological importance of annexins in phloem remains undefined. Phloem transport links sources to sinks and is a key passageway for communication between leaves and roots. Sugars generated from photosynthetic leaves (source organs) and transported through the phloem to roots (sink organs) serve both as metabolic substrates to fuel plant growth and development and as signals that integrate plant responses to environmental stimuli, hormones, and changes in nutrition status (Martin et al., 2002;Moore et al., 2003;Smeekens et al., 2010;Lastdrager et al., 2014;Ljung et al., 2015;Dobrenel et al., 2016;Dodds and Lagudah, 2016;Kühn, 2016;Li and Sheen, 2016;Baena-González and Hanson, 2017). Plants have developed complex sugar-sensing systems to monitor and respond to continuous fluctuations in sugar status caused by the circadian clock and frequent environmental changes (Stitt and Zeeman, 2012). Multiple recent studies have revealed significant roles of sugar in plant growth (Lastdrager et al., 2014) and development (Wingler, 2018). For example, sugar availability to axillary buds is a key determinant for shoot branching. Removal of pea shoot tips induces a sufficient flow of sugar into axillary buds to repress the expression of the branching inhibitor geneBranched1, which highlights the importance of sugars in mediating apical dominance (Mason et al., 2014). Sugars in photosynthetic leaves function as mobile signals to repress the expression of microRNA156 and thus promote the maturation of juvenile plants (Yu et al., 2013). Important sugar responses are also found in roots, whose growth depends on Suc transported from photosynthetic leaves. This dependence underscores the importance of understanding the effects of sugars on root growth and development. Although sugar controls primary and lateral root growth in a dose-dependent manner (Freixes et al., 2002), sugar demand in roots continuously changes due to environmental signals (Lemoine et al., 2013) and developmental stages. Having a sugar-sensing system in roots that can efficiently monitor sugar levels would be important for root and whole-plant growth. However, studies of sugar signaling in roots are generally scant. Root growth is closely associated with sugar concentrations (Thompson et al., 2017). Greater soluble sugar content has been found in fast-growing roots of pruned barley plants, whereas slow-growing barley roots contain less soluble sugar (Farrar and Jones, 1986). Suc generated by photosynthesis in cotyledons is required to regulate primary root growth (Kircher and Schopfer, 2012). Suc promotes primary root elongation in a dose-dependent manner. The higher the exogenous Suc concentration, the faster primary roots elongate (Freixes et al., 2002). Furthermore, the finding that neighboring secondary roots in the same root system have different growth rates in their elongation zone as a function of local sugar concentration also favors the conclusion that sugar is a major determinant of root growth (Freixes et al., 2002). Because local sugar concentrations play critical roles in regulating root growth, it is important to learn more about the mechanisms that control sugar transport into the growing zones of the root. Sugars generated by photosynthesis in leaves are loaded into sieve elements of the phloem and then delivered by phloem into roots (De Schepper et al., 2013). According to pressure flow theory, it is the osmotic differential in phloem sieve elements that drives the bulk flow from source photosynthetic organs to sink organs such as roots. After sugar reaches its destination, it must be unloaded from phloem sieve elements into surrounding cells.Ross-Elliott et al. (2017)have proposed that after sugar reaches the connecting tissue between conducting phloem and sink tissues, called protophloem, it is unloaded into surrounding cells through funnel plasmodesmata and then diffuses freely along a concentration gradient into cells of the root tip in a symplastic way. The unloading of sugar into the elongation zone, mitotic zone, and root cap accommodates the high-energy demands of fast-growing regions in roots. Here, we describe the effect of knocking out two of the eight members of the annexin gene family in Arabidopsis, namelyANN1andANN2, on the diffusion of sugars from the unloading zone to root tips, and we discuss how these two annexins play an important mechanistic role in post-phloem transport of sugars into root tips. Inhibition of Primary Root Growth inANN1andANN2Knockout Mutants Is Rescued by Exogenous Suc Independent of Its Osmotic Effects In 3-d-old seedlings, allANN1andANN2knockout mutants (ann1-2,ann1-3,ann2-1, andann1-2/ann2-1) had primary root lengths that were significantly shorter compared to wild type when grown on agar plates containing no Suc (Fig. 1, A and B). However, these knockout mutants had the same hypocotyl lengths compared to that in wild type (Supplemental Fig. S1). To rule out that the differences in primary root lengths were due to differences in germination, we also measured growth rates in both mutants and wild type under the same condition (Fig. 1B). Consistent with the root length data, the primary roots ofann1-2,ann1-3,ann2-1, andann1-2/ann2-1grew significantly slower compared to that in wild type. Inhibition of primary root growth inANN1andANN2knockout mutants is rescued by exogenous Suc independent of its osmotic effects. A, Representative images comparing primary root growth of 3-d-old Arabidopsis wild-type (Col-0),ann1-2,ann1-3,ann2-1, andann1-2/ann2-1mutant seedlings grown on vertical Murashige and Skoog (MS) plates containing either no Suc, 1% mannitol, or 2% Suc. Bars, 5 mm. B, C, and D, Primary root lengths (left graphs) and growth rates (right graphs) of 3-d-old wild-type (Col-0),ann1-2,ann1-3,ann2-1, andann1-2/ann2-1seedlings grown on vertical MS plates containing either no Suc (B), 2% Suc (C), or 1% mannitol (D). Data are means ±sd(n= 16–20) of three independent experiments. Different letters indicate statistically significant differences as evaluated by Student’sttest (P< 0.05). Inhibition of Root Cap Development inANN1andANN2Knockout Mutants Is Rescued by Exogenous Suc As observed by light microscopy, knocking outANN1orANN2affected primary root structures of 4-d-oldann1-2,ann1-3,ann2-1, andann1-2/ann2-1seedlings when grown without Suc. Starch detection by Lugol staining revealed reduced layers of starch-containing columella cells inann1-2,ann1-3,ann2-1, andann1-2/ann2-1compared to that in the wild type (Fig. 2A). In wild type root caps, there are four layers of columella cells with Lugol-stained starch granules in them, whereas only three layers of columella cells were detected inANN1andANN2knockout mutants. Also, unlike wild-type roots, the roots ofANN1andANN2mutants had no border-like cells around their root caps. These root cap defects inann1-2,ann1-3,ann2-1, andann1-2/ann2-1were rescued by 1% Suc (Fig. 2B). When grown with 1% Suc for 4 d,ann1-2,ann1-3,ann2-1, andann1-2/ann2-1roots showed four layers of starch-containing columella cells like those in wild type with border-like cells attached to the root caps. ANN1andANN2knockout mutants have root cap developmental defects when grown without Suc. A and B, Root cap features revealed by Lugol staining of granule starch in columella cells of 4-d-old Arabidopsis wild-type (Col-0),ann1-2,ann2-1, andann1-2/ann2-1seedlings with or without 1% Suc. Cells with columella identity were detected by staining with Lugol solution. Ten to thirteen seedlings of each set of wild-type (Col-0) and mutant plants were observed. Root tips with stained columella cells of seedlings grown without Suc (A) and with 1% Suc (B). White arrow indicates border-like cells. Bars, 10 μm. Because Lugol staining (Fig. 2A) revealed similar levels of starch granules inann1-2,ann2-1, andann1-2/ann2-1when seedlings were grown without Suc,ann1-2was used as a representative line for allann-mutants in subsequent quantification of root-tip starch levels (Fig. 3). Consistent with Lugol staining,ann1-2displayed significantly lower levels of starch in root tips compared to that in wild type when grown without Suc (Fig. 3). ann1-mutant root tips contain less starch than wild-type root tips when grown without Suc. Quantitative analysis of starch content levels in root tips of wild-type (Col-0) andann1-2seedlings grown without Suc. Starch levels were measured in 2-mm root tips harvested from 10-d-old seedlings grown without Suc. Data represent means ±sdof two replicates. Different letters indicate statistically significant differences as evaluated by Student’sttest (P< 0.05). Expression of Photosynthesis-Related Genes and Chlorophyll Accumulation Is Enhanced inANN1Knockout Mutants, Dependent on the Absence of Exogenous Suc An RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis comparing the transcript abundance in total mRNA extracted from primary roots of 2-week-old wild type,ann1-2, andann2-1grown without Suc in light revealed many differentially expressed genes (DEG) in the primary roots of the mutants. After the DEGs were assigned to gene ontology (GO) terms, the GO analysis inann1-2revealed functional enrichment in photosynthesis with seven out of a total of 13 up-regulated GO categories related to photosynthesis (Supplemental Table S1). This indicated significant enhancement in the expression levels of photosynthetic genes inann1-2in the absence of exogenous Suc. Up-regulation of photosynthesis-related gene expression and increased chlorophyll fluorescence inANN1knockout mutant is rescued by exogenous Suc. A and D, RT-qPCR analysis of gene expression levels in cotyledons of 4-d-old wild-type (Col-0) andann1-2seedlings grown without Suc (A) or with 1% Suc (D). Data represent means ±se, (n= 9) of three independent experiments. B and E, Confocal microscopy of chlorophyll fluorescence in cotyledons of 4-d-old wild-type (Col-0) andann1-2seedlings grown without Suc (B) or with 1% Suc (E). Top, chlorophyll fluorescence. Bottom, bright field. Fifteen seedlings were assayed for each set. Bars, 100 μm. C and F, Quantification of chlorophyll fluorescence relative intensity in cotyledons of 4-d-old wild-type (Col-0) andann1-2seedlings grown without Suc (C) or with 1% Suc (F). Values are means ±se(n= 15) of three independent experiments. Different letters indicate statistically significant differences as evaluated by Student’sttest (P< 0.05). We also quantified the accumulation of chlorophyll in cotyledons of 4-d-oldann1-2and wild-type seedlings grown without Suc. Consistent with the up-regulation of photosynthetic gene expression, cotyledons ofann1-2seedlings showed significantly higher intensity of chlorophyll autofluorescence signal than that in wild-type cotyledons, indicating a higher chlorophyll content in cotyledons ofann1-2seedlings compared to that in the wild type (Fig. 4, B and C). Exogenous Suc reversed the enhanced expression of photosynthetic genes and chlorophyll accumulation in cotyledons ofann1-2seedlings. When grown with 1% Suc,ann1-2cotyledons showed similar photosynthetic gene expression levels as that in the wild type (Fig. 4D), and accumulation of chlorophyll in these tissues was also comparable (Fig. 4, E and F). Knocking OutANN1andANN2Induces Accumulation of Soluble Sugars in Primary Roots We quantified neutral soluble sugars in primary roots ofann1-2,ann2-1and wild type by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) using primary roots collected from 1-week-old seedlings grown on agar plates containing no sugars (Supplemental Table S3). Unexpectedly, significantly higher amounts of sugars were detected in bothann1-2andann2-1root tissue relative to that in wild type (Fig. 5A), including significantly higher contents of soluble Glc (Fig. 5B) and Fru (Fig. 5C). Most of the sugar detected was probably in the phloem. ANN1andANN2knockout mutant roots contain significantly more soluble carbohydrates in primary roots when grown without Suc. A to C, Primary roots were harvested from 1-week-old wild-type (Col-0),ann1-2, andann2-1seedlings grown on agar plates containing no Suc. Soluble sugar contents were analyzed by GC/MS to reveal total sugar (A), Glc (B), and Fru (C) contents. Values are means ± SD of triplicates. Different letters indicate statistically significant differences as evaluated by Student’sttest (P< 0.05). Knocking OutANN1andANN2Impairs Post-Phloem Transport in Root Tips Because 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate (CFDA) has been widely used as a phloem-mobile probe (Oparka et al., 1994;Knoblauch et al., 2015), we used CFDA to detect post-phloem transport in wild-type,ann1-2,ann2-1, and theANN1-overexpressing line35S:ANN1.35S:ANN1seedlings showed significantly longer roots compared to that in the wild type when grown without Suc (Supplemental Fig. S3). All seedlings were grown without Suc for 4 d. After applying CFDA on cotyledons for 30 min, the dye was apparent in the two phloem files in primary roots ofann1-2,ann2-1,35S:ANN1, and the wild type (Fig. 6A), indicating successful loading of carboxyfluorescein (CF). The wild type showed a characteristic transport pattern of CF along the root cortex (Fig. 6B). However, inann1-2andann2-1, the diffusion of CF in root tips was restricted (Fig. 6B). ANN1andANN2knockout mutant roots have restricted diffusion of CF to root tips when grown without Suc. A, Representative images showing successful loading of CF in phloem files.

Values are means ±se(n≥ 8). Different letters indicate statistically significant differences as evaluated by Student’sttest (P< 0.05). Knocking OutANN1andANN2Increased ROS Levels and Callose Accumulation in Root Tips Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulate plasmodesmata permeability through callose deposition (Benitez-Alfonso et al., 2009,2011;Stonebloom et al., 2012). To test whether knocking outANN1andANN2leads to ROS accumulation in root tips, 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA), a dye that stains hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), was applied to 3-d-old seedlings grown without Suc. Significantly higher levels of stain were detected in root tips ofann1-2andann2-1compared to that in wild type when grown without Suc (Fig. 7, A and B). Aniline blue was used to detect callose accumulation in root tips of 3-d-old wild-type,ann1-2, andann2-1seedlings grown without Suc, which revealed significantly higher levels of callose deposition inann1-2andann2-1compared to that in wild type (Fig. 7, C and D). ANN1andANN2Knockout Seedlings Show Suc-Dependent Phenotypes Sugar in Regulation of Photosynthesis The regulatory roles of sugar in photosynthetic gene transcripts and photosynthesis capacity have been widely documented (Koch, 1996;Pego et al., 2000). Sugar starvation in plants activates photosynthesis, whereas high sugar levels inhibit photosynthesis (Yu et al., 2015;Sami et al., 2016). Sugar represses the transcriptional activity of photosynthetic gene promoters transiently expressed in maize mesophyll protoplasts (Sheen, 1990). Sugar accumulation in leaves represses photosynthetic gene expression and photosynthesis (Pego et al., 2000). Roots are typical sink organs. Sugar demands in young roots promote photosynthesis in leaves. For example, overexpression of theHIGHER YIELD RICEgene encoding an APETALA2/ETHYLENE RESPONSIVE FACTOR transcription factor leads to increased root length, branching, and strength, which in turn promotes photosynthesis in leaves (Ambavaram et al., 2014). However, the mechanism of how plants monitor sugar levels in roots remains an active area of investigation. Here, we hypothesize that root tips are sugar-sensing tissues, and their sugar status can affect photosynthesis capacity in leaves. Post-Phloem Transport of Sugar to Root Tips Sugar diffuses freely along the concentration gradient through plasmodesmata in the root apex. It is now widely accepted that plasmodesmata are dynamic channels whose permeability is highly regulated during plant growth and development (Sager and Lee, 2014). Callose has been found deposited in the neck region of plasmodesmata and can restrict the size exclusion limit of plasmodesmata (Luna et al., 2011;Zavaliev et al., 2011). ROS accumulation can increase callose accumulation, which may result in reduced plasmodesmatal transport (Benitez-Alfonso et al., 2009,2011;Stonebloom et al., 2012). Plant Materials and Growth Conditions Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) Colombia (Col-0) ecotype was used as the wild type in all experiments.ANN1(At1g35720) andANN2(At5g65020) are studied. Annexin T-DNA insertion mutants includingann1-2,ann1-3,ann2-1,ann1-2/ann2-1, and35S:ANN1used in this study were all obtained fromWang et al. (2015). All seeds were surface sterilized by 75% (v/v) ethanol for 1 min and 20% bleach (v/v) for 10 min. After washing five times with sterile, deionized water, seeds were sowed on agar plates containing either no Suc, 2% (w/v) Suc, or 1% (w/v) mannitol. Seeds on agar plates were stratified in darkness at 4°C for 3 d. Stratified plates were placed vertically in a growth chamber (Percival AR-66 L; light intensity of 275/µmol m−2s−1, humidity of approximately 80%, 20°C) in continuous light or in darkness. Unless otherwise noted, chemicals were reagent grade from Sigma-Aldrich. Lugol Staining of Columella Cells Seedlings grown with 1% Suc or without Suc were submerged in a root cap fixative solution (5% [w/v] formaldehyde, 5% [v/v] acetic acid, and 25% [v/v] ethanol) for 24 h. Lugol staining of root caps was done as described byHong et al. (2015). Ten to thirteen seedlings were imaged for each genotype with a DIC optics on a Nikon 90i Stereology microscope, using a 60× objective. Trizol reagent was used in all RNA extraction experiments following the manufacturer’s protocol. To elucidate the mechanisms of ANN1 and ANN2 in regulation of primary root growth, we performed a comparative RNA-seq using total RNA from primary roots excised from 2-week-old wild-type,ann1-2, andann2-1seedlings grown without Suc in light. Total RNA extracted from primary roots of 2-week-old wild-type,ann1-2, andann2-1seedlings grown without Suc was submitted to the Genome Sequencing and Analysis Facility (GSAF) at the University of Texas at Austin. Both library construction and sequencing were performed by GSAF. After filtering low-quality reads and removing adaptor contamination from the raw data of Illumina reads, the following steps were as described byVan Verk et al. (2013)to detect differential expression inann1-2andann2-1compared to Col-0. A cutoff value of a greater than 2-fold change in expression was used to select differentially expressed genes inann1-2andann2-1. To further investigate the biological functions of the DEG in bothann1-2andann2-1, we subsequently assigned the DEGs to GO terms. TAIR10 was downloaded for gene function descriptions and GO annotations. Ture-path rule was applied in functional enrichment analysis. A gene annotated with a particular GO term was also annotated with all its parents. To avoid very generic, noninformative terms for analysis, only terms annotating 500 or fewer genes were retained. Genes annotated with a given specific GO term were considered as a gene set. All the gene sets were tested for the statistical significance of enrichment among themselves using the cumulative hypergeometric test. Then a Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995) was also calculated. A false discovery rate threshold of 0.05 was used for significance. cDNA was transcribed from RNA by the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher) after DNase I digestion. Ten micrograms cDNA was used for each sample. RT-qPCR was performed on QuantStudio platform (Applied Biosystems) with PowerUp Sybr Green Master Mix (Thermo Fisher). Transcripts ofcab2(AT1G29920),cab3(AT1G29910),LHB1B1(AT2G34430),LHB1B2(AT2G34420),ANN1(AT1G35720), andANN2(AT5G65020) under different conditions were studied. Primer sequences used in all RT-qPCR experiments to detect gene expression are listed inSupplemental Table S2. Specificity of gene amplifications were confirmed by melting curves. For each condition tested, three biological replicates for both wild type andann1-2with three technical replicates for each biological replicate were used. 2−ΔΔCTmethod (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001) was used to calculate fold changes. For significant difference between each condition, either one-way ANOVA for three conditions or Student’sttest for two conditions was used. Detection of Chlorophyll Autofluorescence Cotyledons of 4-d-old intactann1-2and wild-type seedlings grown either with 1% Suc or without Suc were examined. Chlorophyll autofluorescence 660 to 701 nm was detected with an excitation wavelength of 488 nm. Fifteen seedlings were examined forann1-2and the wild type. Wild-type,ann1-2, andann2-1seedlings were grown in continuous light on agar plates containing no Suc for a week. Primary roots were collected and washed in sterile water twice. After freeze drying for 2 d, samples were submitted to complex carbohydrate research center at the University of Georgia for GC/MS analysis. Triplicate experiments were carried out. CFDA stock was prepared as 6 mg/mL in acetone and kept at −80°C. A dilution of 1:20 in sterile water was used for application. Wild-type,ann1-2, andann2-1seedlings were grown on agar plates containing no Suc for 4 d. A cotyledon was grazed by fine tweezers to allow 1 µL CFDA to penetrate. All samples were excited by 488-nm laser. Fluorescence 500 to 566 nm was monitored. Three-day-old wild-type,ann1-2, andann2-1seedlings grown without Suc were used. Whole seedlings were incubated in the buffer (30 mmKCl and 10 mmMES-KOH, pH 6.15) with 50 µmH2DCFDA for 1 h in darkness at room temperature. Extra dye was washed three times by the buffer before confocal microscopy. All samples were excited by 488-nm laser. Fluorescence between 517 and 527 nm was collected. Three-day-old wild-type,ann1-2, andann2-1seedlings grown without Suc were stained by aniline blue (Biosupplies) as described byRoss-Elliott et al. (2017). Confocal imaging was done by a confocal laser scanning microscope (Zesis LSM 710) in a set manner, starting with the same image acquisition settings and data processing for all experiments. Fluorescent signals in all samples were recorded in Z stacks. Z-project in Fiji was used to flatten Z stacks either with average intensity for better quantification accuracy or with maximum intensity for better focus in representative images. Relative fold change of fluorescent intensity was calculated by division of the mean fluorescent intensity in wild type. Student’sttest was used to calculate significant difference between samples. Fluorescence was quantified in a way to avoid size difference.
