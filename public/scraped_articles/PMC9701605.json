They also discuss special considerations needed for tissue preservation and data analysis for these sample types. For decades, the health risks associated with space exploration have been increasingly documented and characterized. For some of these risks, countermeasures have been sufficiently developed to sustain human health in low-Earth orbit, the orbital distance from Earth that includes the International Space Station (ISS). However, as humankind plans for a permanent presence on the moon and seeks to advance to Mars, the limits to our countermeasures and the research gaps that have insofar remained unaddressed will create health challenges that rival the engineering challenges of long-duration space missions. To gain a comprehensive understanding of how spaceflight affects the human body, the molecular responses of the body to spaceflight factors must be robustly profiled. Recent advances in omics technologies have already revolutionized our approach to understanding disease1,2,3and have created new pathways for tackling health challenges on Earth.4,5,6However, the spaceflight environment presents a unique set of factors where the genomic impact is largely unknown. Furthermore, the microgravity and radiation environment of space remains difficult to model on Earth. Therefore, given that the opportunities to study the influence of spaceflight on the human genome have historically been, and still are, limited, it is of paramount importance to perform all omics experiments in spaceflight to the highest standards. The ISS is currently the only research laboratory available off-world and the source of the majority of spaceflight omics experiments performed to date. Most mammalian omics studies aboard the ISS have usedMus musculus, the standard laboratory rodent, as a model organism.7To scale the number of mammalian studies performed in space, NASA launched their rodent research (RR) program in 2014, with the first omics experiment published in the NASA funded GeneLab database in 2015.8,9Since the program began, the RR program has launched over a dozen missions generating a steady stream of new omics data on a variety of murine tissues and cell systems. These missions have proven essential for understanding the molecular response of terrestrial life to the environmental stressors of space by providing gene expression data for a subset of mouse tissues. These studies have helped illuminate changes within biological systems including the mitochondria,10musculoskeletal system,11circadian rhythm,12and microRNA (miRNA) profiles.13 In this perspective piece, we present the current status of scRNA-seq and SRT in spaceflight experiments, the optimal tissue preservation protocols that should be implemented to ensure the success of these experiments, and the downstream computational tools that are used to obtain high-resolution gene expression insights. scRNA-seq: Importance to spaceflight and prior ISS study designs In less than a decade, the field of scRNA-seq has matured and produced multiple robust protocols for examining the gene expression of individual cells. This has resulted in a paradigm shift in the field of transcriptomics that has enabled the identification of new cell types, uncovered rare cell populations, revealed cellular heterogeneity, charted cell-lineage trajectories during development and disease, and profiled the perturbation of cellular states.16,17,18,19,20,21 scRNA-seq also has great potential when applied to cell systems and tissues exposed to spaceflight. While gene expression changes have been observed in cell systems and tissues, the exact cell populations driving these expression differences have not yet been characterized. For example, large changes in gene expression have been observed in the murine retina,22but the differences attributable to specific retinal subpopulations, such as rod photoreceptors, cone photoreceptors, retinal ganglion cells, bipolar cells, amacrine cells, and horizontal cells, have yet to be pinpointed. Similarly, differences in immune function have been observed during spaceflight in the past,23,24,25where the application of scRNA-seq would have enabled further dissection of specific gene expression differences in the cell populations of, for example, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), thymus tissue, and bone marrow. Overall, the possibility of identifying exact cell populations that are dysregulated during spaceflight enables the development of more precise therapeutics and countermeasures. While there is a spectrum of approaches for scRNA-seq that have been applied across ground-based experiments, only two platforms (Chromium by 10X Genomics and Rhapsody Single-Cell Analysis System by BD Biosciences) have been applied to samples flown in spaceflight.26,27These were applied to two experiments: the second rodent research reference mission (RRRM-2) and the NASA Twins Study. In both, single-cell suspensions were obtained, cells were physically isolated from one another, and polyadenylated mRNA was captured using oligo(dT)s that were uniquely labeled per cell to differentiate mRNA of different cells in the experiment. In the RRRM-2 experiment, 40 mice were flown to the ISS and were part of four distinct groups distinguished by age, duration spent on the ISS, and whether the animal was ISS-terminal or Earth-acclimatized after live animal return (LAR) (Figure 1A). A matching set of 40 mice were also housed on Earth to serve as a ground control. Out of the 80 mice between the ground control and spaceflight groups, 16 animals that were part of the LAR group were selected for single-cell sequencing. Single-cell sequencing of spleen tissue, PBMCs, humerus bone marrow, and femur bone marrow was performed using the 10X Genomics Chromium platform. Data for these experiments are publicly available in GeneLab28,29,30,31(Table 1) and analysis of these datasets is underway in NASA’s Analysis Working Groups (https://genelab.nasa.gov/awg/charter). scRNA-seq datasets from spaceflight samples (A) Design for the rodent research reference mission 2 (RRRM-2) experiment. In RRRM-2, two age groups of mice were launched to the ISS. After 32 days, half of the mice from each age group returned to Earth, where they lived 24 additional days before dissection. This was time-matched with the remaining groups of mice in orbit, which were euthanized and frozen in-flight. Sixteen mice total were selected for scRNA-seq using the 10X Genomics platform. Four cell/tissue types were selected for scRNA-seq, and they each have an associated GeneLab Dataset (GLDS) publicly available: femur bone marrow (GLDS-402), humerus bone marrow (GLDS-403), PBMCs (GLDS-404), and spleen tissue (GLDS-405). (B) PBMCs from human blood were obtained before and after spaceflight on the ISS as part of the NASA Twins Study. Whole blood was obtained using venipuncture into a sodium citrate cell processing tube (CPT) and PBMCs were obtained from the buffy coat after centrifugation of the CPT. scRNA-seq datasets from spaceflight A complete list of scRNA-seq datasets from samples exposed to spaceflight. Four datasets are from the RRRM-2 mission and are available on GeneLab. One dataset is from the NASA Twin Study and is part of the NASA Life Sciences Data Archive (LSDA). Due to privacy concerns around human genomic data, the Twin Study data is not publicly available but can be requested. The LSDA has a public-facing portal where data requests can be initiated (https://nlsp.nasa.gov/explore/entryform/lsda_data_requests/lsda_data_requests). The LSDA team provides the appropriate processes, tools, and secure infrastructure for archival of experimental data and dissemination while complying with applicable rules, regulations, policies, and procedures governing the management and archival of sensitive data and information. The only other published experiment that has used scRNA-seq from a spaceflight study is the NASA Twins Study.32In this experiment, a set of identical twins participated in a set of omics assays. One twin served as a ground control and remained on Earth while the other twin spent 340 days aboard the ISS. For scRNA-seq, whole blood was collected via venipuncture into cell processing tubes (CPTs) containing sodium citrate as a preservative (Figure 1B). The CPTs were returned immediately to the lab and centrifuged to collect PBMCs. The BD Biosciences Single-Cell Analysis System was used to collect single-cell expression data (Table 1). One important caveat to this study is that there was no in-flight time point, and blood was collected for scRNA-seq pre-launch and post-landing.13,33The time it takes to return cargo, such as CPTs, to Earth is one of the factors limiting the ease of single-cell experiments. CPTs can be spun-down and frozen before returning to Earth, but this direct freezing process will lyse cells. With cell lysis, it is still possible to generate a sample-wide RNA-seq profile but not at single-cell resolution. To generate single-cell profiles from spaceflight samples, cells will need to be either returned to Earth immediately or cells will need to be preserved using a process that prevents lysis. Spatially resolved transcriptomics: Leveraging legacy samples and steps for proper experimental design prior to spaceflight Tissue preservation: Challenges in spaceflight and recommendations for improvement RNA is known to degrade quickly and can undergo rapid profile changes and degradation in relatively short periods of time resulting in measurable differences within 5 to 10 min of remaining at room temperature postmortem.57Additionally, RNA that is not preserved rapidly is subject to degradation that can create distinct RNA-seq profiles, and different RNA transcripts can degrade at different rates.58,59To account for this, samples intended for scRNA-seq must be preserved rapidly after euthanasia. If the experiment requires single-cell sequencing, the cells should be immediately placed in cryopreservation media and slowly brought to freezing temperature to ensure cells do not lyse during the freezing process. Additionally, tissues should be dissociated prior to freezing. Dissociation after freezing is likely to cause damage to cell membranes and increase the likelihood of RNA leakage due to the stresses of the freezing process. An alternative to immediate dissociation is the application of single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) where isolation of nuclei can be performed on frozen material, and the nuclei are subsequently used as input for single-cell sequencing.60In this case, tissue samples can forgo cryopreservation media and should be brought down to freezing temperatures as quickly as possible, ideally snap-freezing the samples in liquid nitrogen if available. Comparisons of snRNA-seq and scRNA-seq in mouse lungs have shown that they have similar gene detection rates, and dissociation bias is reduced in snRNA-seq.61Likewise, comparisons in kidneys showed similar gene detection rates.62The recently completed Fly Cell Atlas63utilized snRNA-seq instead of scRNA-seq because it can be applied consistently even in problematic tissue type (e.g., antennae, wings, fat bodies) and multinucleated cells (e.g., muscle) and because 70%–90% of transcriptomic information is retained with snRNA-seq.63Moreover, nuclei can be applied as input for single-cell multiomics studies where both the RNA and chromatin accessibility information is captured from the same nucleus simultaneously. Thus, this approach can be extended in spaceflight experiments in the future. Preservation strategies aboard the ISS A list of strategies used for cell, tissue, and nucleic acids preservations that have been previously used in experiments in spaceflight. There are two options that can help address these challenges moving forward: in-flight tissue dissection and LAR. In-flight tissue dissection will allow tissues of interest to be rapidly frozen, as smaller pieces of tissue freeze faster than a whole carcass, and will avoid the double freeze-thaw that tissues undergo if they are dissected from a frozen carcass back on Earth. The drawback to this approach is that tissue dissection is time-intensive and will require specialized crew training to teach dissection competency. Despite the time commitment required for in-flight dissection, it has been performed in select cases, such as hindlimb dissection during the RR-6 mission,92though the data from this in-flight dissection are not publicly available. The second approach, LAR, returns organisms to Earth while still alive where they are euthanized after returning to a ground-based lab.93,94This allows tissues to be preserved according to the highest standards but presents a different set of limitations. Using LAR, organisms have their circadian rhythms disrupted and experience the stressful conditions of atmospheric re-entry. Moreover, depending on the study design of the mission, LAR organisms have the opportunity to begin reacclimating to Earth’s gravity and radiation landscape. Therefore, all three aspects can impact their transcriptomic profiles. Advancing off-world capabilities: Considerations for performing scRNA-seq and SRT in spaceflight Additionally, due to the sensitive nature of RNA, additional laboratory decontamination protocols may need translation to spaceflight. RNase inhibitors will need to be available to wipe down workstations, pipettes, gloves, and any other surfaces the sample may come in contact with. A microbially decontaminated environment would also enhance the quality of RNA obtained, particularly the use of 70% ethanol, isopropanol, or another disinfectant, given the microbe-rich surfaces aboard the ISS.96,97,99However, the use of ethanol and isopropanol on the ISS is an issue because aerosolized alcohol interferes with the environmental control and life support systems (ECLSSs) in the closed-loop space station environment (J. Perry et al., 2016, 46th International Conference on Environmental Systems, conference).

Dataset analyzed with Seurat. Bioinformatic pipelines and considerations for SRT in spaceflight experiments In comparison, the establishment of best practices for the analysis of SRT data is a work in progress. The advent of SRT allows for solving the spatial distribution of transcripts, as well as locating cell types and cell states in complex tissues, organs, and organoids. Standardizing analysis across a wide variety of tissue configurations and the large number of emerging technologies is a difficult and complex task. Knowledge of the types of software tools available for each method can help inform experimental selection decisions about which SRT method best matches the specific scientific questions under investigation. Specialized tools have also been developed for cluster analysis,112,113fusion transcript detection,114visualization,115deconvolution of cell-type mixtures,116inference of extracellular interacting genes,117identification of sub-tissue architecture/anatomization, finding spatially variable genes,118,119,120quantifying spatial heterogeneity,121imputation of missing mRNA expression,122or improvement of gene expression quantification using spatial, temporal and experimental coordinates. Moreover, comprehensive tools such asSTutilitybuilds on the Seurat framework to facilitate analyzing and visualizing multiple samples from the 10X Genomics Visium platform.123Integration across data types also gives these tools increased investigative potential. For example, integration of single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data, achieved with tools such ascell2location124andstereoscope125to name a few, can enhance spatial transcriptomics resolution to an unprecedented level.126Moreover, integration of gene expression data with histology information and spatial location using machine learning (ML) is also under active research.127For instance, the frameworkSquidpyis interconnected withScanpyand the ML Python ecosystem.111 Despite these advances, challenges associated with metadata standards and data processing exist, including reliable cell segmentation, cell-type identification, integration of expression patterns to anatomical features, finding complex patterns, integration of data from different specimens, time points or perturbations, development of standardized metrics and benchmarks, as well as integration across multiple technologies.128Other analytical challenges remain for the analysis of SRT data, including those related to sample mapping and image registration and segmentation, data representation, imputation of sparse spatial data, integration of multi-modal data, and automatic inference of knowledge for the combination of tissue structure and molecular data.111 Future prospects for omics technology in spaceflight The aging ISS, destined to reach its end of life by 2030, has catalyzed an era of “commercial space,” which promises rapid development of the final frontier. To avoid a gap in continuous human presence in space, four private companies are aiming to build and operate commercial space stations in low-Earth orbit. Axiom Space will launch and attach the first segment of its modular space station to the ISS in 2024 and build the remainder of the station while attached to the ISS. The completed Axiom Station will detach to become a free flier by 2030 (https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/nasa-details-intent-to-replace-the-international-space-station-with-a-commercial-space-station-by-2030/). Blue Origin has partnered with Sierra Space to build Orbital Reef, while StarLab will be born out of a partnership between Nanoracks, Voyager Space, and Lockheed Martin. The fourth, yet to be named, space station development effort is being led by Northrup Grumman (https://news.northropgrumman.com/news/releases/northrop-grumman-signs-agreement-with-nasa-to-design-space-station-for-low-earth-orbit). Furthermore, advances in rocket technology, including reusable engines, have lowered launch costs significantly and increased the cadence of spaceflights to and from the ISS. For example, SpaceX Crew-4 launched to the ISS less than 2 days after Ax-1, Axiom’s private astronaut mission to the ISS, returned to Earth. Research in space has been fundamental to our understanding of how to survive and thrive in the weightless environment. Our knowledge and sophistication of scientific investigations in space is continuously strengthened by advances in hardware technology and operations. Numerous hardware options for biological investigations that require cell culture capabilities and maintenance of live specimen in spaceflight, for instance, are already available. A few examples of include Biopack,130SABL from BioServe Space Technologies (T. Niederwieser, 2015, 45th International Conference on Environmental Systems, conference), Kubik,131NanoRacks Frame-3, STaARS-1 EF132, and the CubeLab from Space Tango.133A more current system called the ScienceTaxi (https://www.yurigravity.com/our-service) developed by Yuri Gravity can be integrated into the ISS and into the newer stations coming online; an autonomous version of the ScienceTaxi is in development. This small sampling of hardware options is indicative of the demand for laboratory equipment that is operational in a weightless space environment and the importance of biological experiments conducted in space. Now, in this new era of commercial space with new space stations in development, there is an unprecedented opportunity to leverage past research experiences in space to re-think and re-design future technologies and laboratories for spaceflight investigations that are on-par with Earth technologies, yet not limited by gravity-based thinking. For example, the speed of technology and methodology innovation for scRNA-seq and SRT is advancing the field rapidly for terrestrial investigations. Future scRNA-seq and SRT methodologies will enable simultaneous multi-omic measurements from individual cells and spatial regions. The potential of these developments has already been commercially realized for single-cell methodologies by 10X Genomics, whose Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression kits offer simultaneous measurement of scRNA-seq and chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq) data from the same group of cells.134,135Similar developments are in motion for SRT where co-mapping of mRNAs and proteins in a formaldehyde-fixed tissue section via NGS has already been achieved.51Moreover, spatially resolved ATAC-seq has been developed,136,137but does not yet allow for simultaneous measurement of RNA. Given the trajectory of the single-cell and spatial fields toward simultaneous measurements of multiple genomic features, it is anticipated that the need for improved cell and tissue preservation protocols in spaceflight will persist. In addition to these creative workarounds, there is an opportunity to design and invent new paradigms for conducting omics and other biological research in space. Space scientists must define the requirements for on-orbit research protocols and outline the specific types of research investigations important to conduct in space, the tools and capabilities necessary for those space investigations, and the criteria for acceptable high-quality science on orbit. These requirements will serve as a guide for commercial space station developers in defining their own orbital lab designs, including hardware capabilities and services. Armed with an understanding of the types of equipment required to conduct the research, commercial space station developers would be better equipped to consider partnerships with terrestrial technology developers that are leading the rapid advances in omics technology and encourage them to adapt their technologies for a weightless space environment by developing future iterations of their technology with space constraints in mind. While an upfront investment of capital is required for a state-of-the-art orbital lab, a high return on investment can be expected. Improved on-orbit capabilities that are easier to access and operate will generate greater interest in space-based research investigations, which in turn will increase the demand to leverage spaceflight as an extreme environment for research—for example, the general adaptability of the human body, which may result in the discovery of new molecular mechanisms. It is expected that the reduction in costs to execute orbital science will translate into lower prices for the researcher, thereby generating even greater interest in space. Taken together, these developments will drive a feedforward loop toward greater insights for extending humanity’s footprint in space and improving life on the ground. Even with rapid advances in genomics and spaceflight technology, experimentation in space will remain costly and time-consuming in the foreseeable future. Thus, careful design of experiments is crucial. One factor that may alleviate the risk of these experiments isin silicomodeling. Perturbations on transcription and gene expression can be modeled using ML algorithms to test hypotheses prior to launching an experiment into space.139Adapting these models to be more amenable to the environmental factors of spaceflight can help use limited spaceflight resources more efficiently. Additionally, to aid with experimental design, a specific SRT method should be selected before experiment launch to implement its optimized tissue preservation protocol, and the development status of available computational tools should be rigorously assessed to understand the expected analysis types and data resolutions available. Given the rapid advancements in SRT analysis, ideal tools and capabilities will grow quickly over time. This sector will continue to push for more state-of-the-art knowledge and state-of-the-art technology never attempted before to develop innovative approaches for improving life sciences research in space. It is also a high-risk, high-reward sector, where projects tend to be expensive to fund and maintain but have the potential to unlock discoveries essential for humans to become a multi-planetary species. Through joint collaborations and partnerships and by building on previous milestones, resources, and tools that have been established for spaceflight, we can continue to rapidly advance our in-flight genomics capabilities.
