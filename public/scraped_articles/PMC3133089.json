Received 2010 Nov 4; Accepted 2011 Feb 28. Salmonella entericaserovar Typhimurium possesses a stimulon of genes that are differentially regulated in response to conditions of low fluid shear force that increase bacterial virulence and alter other phenotypes. In this study, we show that a previously uncharacterized member of this stimulon,ydcIor STM1625, encodes a highly conserved DNA binding protein with related homologs present in a range of Gram-negative bacterial genera. Gene expression analysis shows thatydcIis expressed in different bacterial genera and is involved in its autoregulation inS. Typhimurium. We demonstrate that purified YdcI protein specifically binds a DNA probe consisting of its own promoter sequence. We constructed anS. Typhimurium ΔydcImutant strain and show that this strain is more sensitive to both organic and inorganic acid stress than is an isogenic WT strain, and this defect is complemented intrans. Moreover, our data indicate thatydcIis part of therpoSregulon related to stress resistance. TheS. Typhimurium ΔydcImutant was able to invade cultured cells to the same degree as the WT strain, but a strain in whichydcIexpression is induced invaded cells at a level 2.8 times higher than that of the WT. In addition, induction ofydcIexpression inS. Typhimurium resulted in the formation of a biofilm in stationary-phase cultures. These data indicate theydcIgene encodes a conserved DNA binding protein involved with aspects of prokaryotic biology related to stress resistance and possibly virulence. The first studies to identify the bacterial genes of the low fluid shear stimulon were performed withS. Typhimurium cultures grown in an RWV bioreactor (39,55) and during spaceflight (52,53). Genes of theS. Typhimurium low fluid shear stimulon were found to be distributed across the genome and belong to a wide variety of functional groups, including various transport systems, lipopolysaccharide synthesis pathways, protein secretion mechanisms, various metabolic pathways, and genes of unknown function (52,53,55). In addition, several genes encoding previously uncharacterized transcriptional regulatory proteins inS. Typhimurium were also found to be part of the low fluid shear stimulon (52,53,55). These genes are of particular interest not only for their potential role in mediating bacterial responses to low fluid shear but also for their potential to allow us to better understand the global circuits that influence bacterial physiology in general. It is highly likely that previously unexplored transcriptional regulators that are identified via the low fluid shear stimulon will be involved in aspects of prokaryotic biology that are able to be studied under “standard conditions” outside the context of low fluid shear. Bacterial strains, plasmids, and media. Strains and plasmids used in this study The YdcI homologs from the indicated Gram-negative species were identified using BLAST search analysis withS. Typhimurium YdcI (GenBank accession no.AAL20543) as the query (1). Homologs were aligned using CLUSTAL W analysis as previously described (46,51). Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR was performed as described previously (51,55), using approximately 4 to 6 μg RNA from late-log-phase cultures (optical density at 600 nm [OD600] = 0.9 to 1.4). RNA was isolated using RNA Protect reagent and RNeasy spin prep kits (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA). LacZ assays were performed with late-log-phase cultures using standard protocols as described previously (35), and the data presented represent the mean and standard deviation of three or four independent experiments each assayed in duplicate or triplicate reactions. Expression and purification of YdcI protein. Escherichia colistrain TOP10 containing pBAD18+ydcIwas grown to an OD600of approximately 0.5 to 0.8, induced with 0.1% arabinose, and then grown for an additional 3 h. Cells were harvested, lysed using B-Per reagent (Pierce/Thermo-Fisher, Rockford, IL), and processed for isolation of YdcI protein (with a six-histidine tag) using nickel-agarose spin columns in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (Zymo Research, Orange, CA). Coomassie staining and Western blot analysis with anti-six-histidine antibody (Immunology Consultants Lab, Inc., Newberg, OR) were performed using standard protocols as described previously (2,49,50). Gel shift reactions were performed in the presence of 10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 50 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 μg salmon sperm DNA, and 0.1 μg/ml bovine serum albumin with approximately 1 ng of probe. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 20 min at room temperature before being loaded onto a prerun 8% acrylamide gel in 0.5× Tris-borate-EDTA (TBE) buffer at 150 V. Probe labeling and detection were performed using a nonradioactive kit in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce/Thermo-Fisher, Rockford, IL) with positively charged nylon membrane (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). The 180-bp probe H3 consisted of DNA extending upstream from 38 bp downstream of theydcIATG codon (S. Typhimurium coordinates 1714755 to 1714935) that was PCR amplified using the primers indicated in Table S1 in the supplemental material and purified using a spin column in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (Zymo Research, Orange, CA). The 182-bp probe H5 consisted of DNA upstream of the H3 probe from coordinates 1714573 to 1714754, and thelacZprobe consisted of 152 bp amplified from thelacZgene using the primers indicated in Table S1 in the supplemental material. Competition assays were performed under the binding conditions described above with increasing amounts of a molar excess of unlabeled DNA that was either specific (the 180-bpydcIpromoter fragment) or nonspecific (lacZfragment), as indicated. Thermal, osmotic, and acid stress assays. Stress assays were performed as described previously, using shaking broth cultures grown to stationary phase (39,52–54). The data presented represent the mean and standard deviation of four independent experiments each plated in triplicate. Tissue culture invasion and intracellular survival assays. Invasion of Int407 intestinal epithelial cells and survival in J774 macrophages were assayed as described previously with a multiplicity of infection of approximately 30 using late-log-phase broth shaking cultures (49–52,54). The data (seeFig. 7) are from four to six independent experiments each performed in triplicate tissue culture wells, except for the pBAD18+lacZstrains, which are from three independent experiments performed in triplicate. Invasion of Int407 cells and survival in J774 macrophages. (A) The indicatedS. Typhimurium strains were tested for invasion of Int407 cells via gentamicin protection assay. The ratio of percent invasion of each strain to that of the control was calculated and graphed. The ΔSPI-1 strain contains a deletion of the SPI-1 genes required for full invasion of Int407 cells. The ΔSPI-1 and ΔydcImutant strains were compared to the WT for ratio calculation. The pBAD18, pBAD18+ydcI, and pBAD18+lacZstrains were compared to the WT pBAD18 strain under the corresponding arabinose condition for ratio calculation. (B) The indicated strains were tested for survival in J774 macrophages over a period of 18 to 20 h via gentamicin protection assay. The ratio of the percent survival of each strain to that of the control was calculated and graphed. For ratio calculations, the ΔydcImutant strain was compared to the WT and the pBAD18+ydcIstrain was compared to the pBAD18 strain. Strain χ3339 containing pBAD18, pBAD18+ydcI, or pBAD18+lacZwas grown overnight in the absence of arabinose, diluted 1:50 in fresh medium, grown to an OD600of approximately 0.6 to 0.8, supplemented with arabinose to 0.1%, and grown for an additional 12 to 16 h. Crystal violet staining of biofilms and subsequent quantitation were performed as described previously (9,43). TheS. TyphimuriumydcIgene encodes a conserved protein. Alignment of theS. Typhimurium YdcI protein with homologs present in a range of other Gram-negative genera. Yellow highlighting indicates amino acid identity (in at least five of the proteins). The e values for the aligned proteins are less than 10−140, except for theSerratiaprotein, whose e value is 10−92. Analysis ofydcIgene expression. RT-PCR ofydcIgene homologs in a range of Gram-negative genera. The plus and minus lanes contain samples with and without reverse transcriptase, respectively. The Ch lane contains samples where chromosomal DNA isolated from the indicated strain was used in the PCR. NCR refers to a noncoding region in theS. Typhimurium genome between two divergent promoters that is not predicted to be transcribed. Analysis ofydcI::lacZfusions inS. Typhimurium. (A) A promoterlesslacZgene was transcriptionally fused to the WT and ΔydcImutant alleles of theS. TyphimuriumydcIgene in separate strains. The maps of the WT, ΔydcI::lacZ, and WTydcI::lacZgene loci in theS. Typhimurium strain genomes are shown. (B) The LacZ activity of the strains in panel A is shown. In addition, the ΔydcI::lacZstrain was transformed with either pBAD18 or pBAD18+ydcIand assayed for LacZ activity in the presence or absence of arabinose. Purification and DNA binding activity of YdcI protein. Gel shift assays with YdcI protein. (A) The labeled H3 DNA probe from theS. TyphimuriumydcIpromoter region was incubated with YdcI cell extracts or purified YdcI protein and run in an 8% acrylamide–TBE gel. Lanes: 1, probe alone; 2, TOP10(pBAD18+ydcI) extract, 300 ng; 3, TOP10(pBAD18) extract, 300 ng; 4, purified YdcI protein, approximately 10 nM.

(C) YdcI gel shift reaction mixtures with labeled H3 probe were incubated with unlabeled specific (H3 DNA fragment) or nonspecific (lacZDNA fragment) competitor DNA and then run in an 8% acrylamide gel. Lanes: 1, probe alone; 2, no competitor; 3 to 5, specific competitor at 135×, 270×, and 540× molar excesses, respectively; 6 to 8, nonspecific competitor at 135×, 270×, and 540× molar excesses, respectively. Stress assays reveal an acid resistance defect in anS. TyphimuriumydcImutant. Acid resistance defect inS. Typhimurium ΔydcImutant. Isogenic WT and ΔydcI S. Typhimurium strains were tested for resistance to osmotic (2.5 M NaCl), thermal (50°C), and acid (pH 3.5 using citric acid or HCl) stress over a time period of 120 min. The percent survival of the WT and ΔydcImutant strains under the corresponding stress (compared to before addition of stress) was calculated, and a ratio of the percent survival of the indicated ΔydcImutant test strain to that of the WT strain is shown. The ΔydcImutant strain containing pBAD18 or pBAD18+ydcIwas grown in the presence of arabinose. Relationship between theydcIandrpoSgenes. Tissue culture invasion assays. We also tested if the ΔydcImutation or induction ofydcIexpression had any effect onS. Typhimurium survival in J774 macrophages. Neither the deletion nor the induction of theydcIgene had any effect onS. Typhimurium macrophage survival (Fig. 7B). When cultures of strain χ3339 containing pBAD18 or pBAD18+ydcIwere supplemented with arabinose and allowed to grow for approximately 12 to 16 h postsupplementation, we observed that the strain containing pBAD18+ydcIformed a biofilm which was especially prominent at the medium-air interface (Fig. 8A). This biofilm was readily stained with crystal violet, indicating significant cell adhesion (Fig. 8A), and this observation was confirmed via microscopy (data not shown). Biofilm staining was readily observed in areas below the medium-air interface, suggesting that biofilm-mediated adhesion was not dependent on the interface (Fig. 8A). The control strain containing pBAD18 did not form a biofilm after arabinose supplementation (Fig. 8A). In addition, both strains did not form a biofilm under the same growth conditions in the absence of arabinose (data not shown). To confirm that biofilm formation was not the result of general protein expression from the pBAD18 arabinose-inducible promoter, we performed the same assay with strain χ3339 containing pBAD18+lacZ. This strain had a phenotype identical to that of the pBAD18 control and did not form a biofilm upon arabinose supplementation (Fig. 8B). Quantitation of crystal violet staining of the biofilm confirmed the qualitative differences observed between the strains inFig. 8(see Fig. S7 in the supplemental material). To test if theydcIgene plays a role in transmission of the low fluid shear environmental signal inS. Typhimurium, we tested both the WT and ΔydcImutant strains for two separate phenotypes induced by low fluid shear growth in the RWV apparatus. Previous studies have established that low fluid shear conditions alter the acid and oxidative stress resistance profiles of WTS. Typhimurium (39,41,52–55). We grew cultures of the WT and ΔydcImutant strains under low fluid shear and control conditions in the RWV and subjected these cultures to separate acid (pH 3.5 using citric acid) and oxidative (70 mM H2O2) stresses. In both tests, the ΔydcImutant strain displayed the same low fluid shear-induced phenotype as the WT strain (Fig. 9). This indicates that theydcIgene is not required for these low fluid shear responses inS. Typhimurium under these conditions. Low fluid shear phenotypes of WT and ΔydcImutant strains via RWV culture. TheS. Typhimurium WT and ΔydcImutant strains were grown in the RWV apparatus in low fluid shear (LFS) or control conditions, and the cultures were tested for acid stress resistance (pH 3.5 with citric acid) or oxidative stress resistance (70 mM H2O2) in separate assays. The percent survival of the WT and ΔydcImutant strains for each culture condition in each stress was calculated, and a ratio of the percent survival of each sample to the control condition for each stress is shown. Low fluid shear culture alters stress resistance compared to the control for both the WT and ΔydcImutant strains. Growth conditions such as spaceflight and RWV culture that are characterized by low fluid shear force have been shown to increase bacterial virulence (39,52,53). In addition, an array of other phenotypes is induced or altered via this growth environment (6,7,40,41). Interestingly, these fluid shear levels are relevant to those encountered by certain pathogens in the human host during the course of infection (23,36,40,41). However, this environmental cue is not well characterized, and a number of uncharacterized genes with unknown function are part of a stimulon associated with low fluid shear force (7,52,53,55). Unexplored genes with potentially important, observable roles in prokaryotic biology could be part of this stimulon, but they may not have been previously analyzed because they have not been identified as part of any established regulatory networks or phenotypes. One such gene,S. TyphimuriumydcI, was discovered to be a member of theS. Typhimurium low fluid shear stimulon and has been predicted be homologous to the LysR family of transcriptional regulators (54,55). However, theydcIgene was previously uncharacterized before this study. Expression of theydcIgene is upregulated by low fluid shear growth conditions (54,55). Interestingly, though theydcIgene is clearly expressed in bacteria under “standard” culture conditions, theS. TyphimuriumydcIgene appears to be repressed and expressed at relatively low levels under these conditions. One intriguing possibility is thatydcIis expressed at a certain level under one set of conditions and is then upregulated by an environmental signal(s) to induce adaptive cellular changes for another set of conditions. As indicated by our data, these changes could include altering resistance to stresses, interactions with host cells, or physiology related to biofilm formation. Whether these changes function to adaptS. Typhimurium or other bacteria for their roles as pathogens remains to be determined with future studies. However, our data suggest that, at a minimum, theydcIgene likely regulates genes with the potential for involvement in functions related to stress resistance, growth/survival, and possibly virulence. The observation thatydcIexpression involves the RpoS sigma factor provides support to this hypothesis since RpoS controls the expression of a regulon of genes involved in stress resistance and virulence (16,26,29,38). However, we have previously reported that RpoS is not required for a range of low fluid shear responses inS. Typhimurium (54). Therefore, a possible scheme for the regulation ofydcIexpression is that RpoS is used for expression under certain conditions and another (yet to be identified) pathway is used for expression under other conditions (such as low fluid shear). Future studies will be aimed at determining howydcIgene regulation fits into regulatory schemes in a range of bacteria. This is the first report to demonstrate DNA binding activity of the YdcI protein. We show that both (i) extracts containing YdcI protein and (ii) purified YdcI protein are able to bind a DNA probe (from theS. TyphimuriumydcIpromoter region) in a specific manner. The YdcI DNA binding activity displays an apparent dissociation constant with a value consistent with specific DNA binding proteins with biologic functions and consistent with other members of LysR family (to which YdcI belongs) (34,44,47). Induced expression of the YdcI protein repressed anS. TyphimuriumydcI::lacZfusion and complemented the acid resistance defect of anS. Typhimurium ΔydcImutant. These observations suggest that the YdcI DNA binding activity functions in bacterial cells to affect physiological changes. Future studies will be aimed at determining (i) the specific DNA site that is recognized by YdcI, (ii) the genes associated with YdcI binding sites, and (iii) whether these sites are used by YdcI in other bacterial species. We identified potential binding sites within the H3 probe fragment, but smaller DNA fragments containing these individual sites did not display YdcI binding activity. Identification of the actual YdcI binding site will require additional, systematic study that is beyond the scope of this report. However, this report provides a foundation for analyzing the previously uncharacterized YdcI DNA binding activity via a number of approaches. Though inducedydcIexpression affectsS. Typhimurium intestinal epithelial cell invasion and biofilm formation, we do not know how the YdcI protein functions in these phenotypes. We demonstrate that the host cell interaction phenotype only affects the invasion of intestinal epithelial cells and not survival in macrophages. One possibility for this may be thatydcIcan alter the expression of genes involved in SPI-1 type III secretion-mediated invasion of nonphagocytic cells or other genes involved in specific interactions with epithelial cells. Indeed, the induction ofydcIdid not increase invasion by a ΔSPI-1 strain, suggesting thatydcIpossibly acts through the SPI-1 pathway for increased invasion. We tested a SPI-1invI::lacZfusion for altered expression in the presence of pBAD18+ydcIand found thatydcIinduction produced a 7.1-fold decrease in reporter expression (data not shown). This indicates that YdcI may potentially alter SPI-1 gene expression as part of its function, but how YdcI would do this in the context of the many different SPI-1 genes and the other regulators of SPI-1 gene expression remains to be determined. Systematic identification of the genes regulated by YdcI and elucidation of how YdcI controls these genes as part of an overall regulatory scheme will require further controlled study. Biofilm formation inSalmonellaspp. appears to be a complex process and has been shown to involve a number of different genes involved in flagella and curli fiber formation, cellulose production, and O-antigen synthesis (8,9,27,28,31). In addition, there are likely at least two different types of biofilms formed bySalmonellaspp. that are utilized on either cholesterol-rich surfaces (like gallstones) or on material surfaces like glass or plastic (8,9). We do not know howydcIaffectsSalmonellagenes involved in biofilm formation, but studies aimed at determining the nature of theydcI-induced biofilm and the genes involved in this process are currently being pursued.
