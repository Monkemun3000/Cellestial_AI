Depleting galactose from the cell wall polysaccharide xyloglucan leads to a disruption of diverse cellular and physiological processes involved in normal plant growth. Xyloglucan is a polysaccharide that has important roles in the formation and function of the walls that surround growing land plant cells. Many of these plants synthesize xyloglucan that contains galactose in two different side chains (L and F), which exist in distinct molecular environments. However, little is known about the contribution of these side chains to xyloglucan function. Here, we show that Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mutants devoid of the F side chain galactosyltransferase MURUS3 (MUR3) form xyloglucan that lacks F side chains and contains much less galactosylated xylose than its wild-type counterpart. The galactose-depleted xyloglucan is dysfunctional, as it leads to mutants that are dwarfed with curled rosette leaves, short petioles, and short inflorescence stems. Moreover, cell wall matrix polysaccharides, including xyloglucan and pectin, are not properly secreted and instead accumulate within intracellular aggregates. Near-normal growth is restored by generatingmur3mutants that produce no detectable amounts of xyloglucan. Thus, cellular processes are affected more by the presence of the dysfunctional xyloglucan than by eliminating xyloglucan altogether. To identify structural features responsible for xyloglucan dysfunction, xyloglucan structure was modified in situ by generatingmur3mutants that lack specific xyloglucan xylosyltransferases (XXTs) or that overexpress theXYLOGLUCAN L-SIDE CHAIN GALACTOSYLTRANSFERASE2(XLT2) gene. Normal growth was restored in themur3-3mutant overexpressingXLT2and inmur3-3 xxtdouble mutants when the dysfunctional xyloglucan was modified by doubling the amounts of galactosylated side chains. Our study assigns a role for galactosylation in normal xyloglucan function and demonstrates that altering xyloglucan side chain structure disturbs diverse cellular and physiological processes. There have been considerable advances in understanding how changes in specific amino acids or nucleotides affect the ability of a protein or an RNA to fold and to function (Wan et al., 2011;Sauer, 2013). By contrast, much less is known about how polysaccharide structure and function are affected by altering specific monosaccharides within its glycosyl sequence. Here, we report that xyloglucan, a plant cell wall polysaccharide, becomes dysfunctional rather than nonfunctional when its glycosyl sequence is altered. The term dysfunctional polysaccharide is used here to describe a structure that, in and of itself, has a deleterious effect on the growth and development of a plant. Eliminating xyloglucan suppresses the cabbage-like phenotype ofmur3-3plants. A, The major structural features of ArabidopsisXyGand the glycosyltransferases required for side chain formation. Side chains are represented by the letters X, L, and F. An unbranched Glc is designated by the letter G. B, The predominant subunits of ArabidopsisXyG. C, EliminatingXyGsuppresses the dwarf phenotype of themur3-3mutant.mur3-3was crossed withxxt1 xxt2, and two independentxxt1 xxt2 mur3-3triple mutants (nos. 12 and 20) were identified by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. Plants were grown with a 14-h-light (19°C) and 10-h-dark (15°C) cycle. D, The glycome profiles of the materials solubilized from the cell walls by enzymatic and KOH treatments. Each extract was probed with a series of monoclonal antibodies that recognize epitopes ofXyGirrespective of the presence or absence of fucosylated side chains and monoclonal antibodies that bind only toXyGcontaining fucosylated side chains. Yellow, Strong binding; black, no binding. NoXyGwas detected in thexxt1 xxt2double mutant or thexxt1 xxt2 mur3-3triple mutants. E, Cross sections of wild-type and mutant leaves stained with toluidine blue (left column) or immunolabeled with monoclonal antibodies that recognize epitopes of deesterified homogalacturonan (CCRC-M38),XyG(CCRC-M88), or fucosylatedXyG(CCRC-M1). WT, Wild type; EPG, endopolygalacturonase. The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) genes that encode the glycosyltransferases required for the formation of theXyGside chains have been identified (seeFig. 1A). FiveXYLOGLUCAN XYLOSYLTRANSFERASE(XXT1–XXT5) genes encode proteins that have been implicated in the formation of the α-d-xylopyranose-(1→6)-β-d-Glcplinkage (Cavalier et al., 2008;Zabotina et al., 2008;Vuttipongchaikij et al., 2012;Zabotina et al., 2012). Two side chain-specific galactosyltransferases have been characterized (Madson et al., 2003;Jensen et al., 2012). XYLOGLUCAN L-SIDE CHAIN GALACTOSYLTRANSFERASE2 (XLT2) catalyzes the addition of Gal to the middle Xyl (Jensen et al., 2012), whereas MURUS3 (MUR3) adds Gal to the Xyl adjacent to the unbranched Glc (Madson et al., 2003). The Gal added by MUR3 is itself the acceptor for FUCOSYLTRANSFERASE1 (FUT1), which adds a fucosyl residue to form the F side chain (Perrin et al., 1999). Up to 60% of the F side chains of Arabidopsis leafXyGcontainO-acetylated Gal (Perrin et al., 2003). Arabidopsisfut1,xlt2, andxxt1toxxt5mutants that form structurally abnormalXyG(Vanzin et al., 2002;Madson et al., 2003;Perrin et al., 2003;Peña et al., 2004;Jensen et al., 2012;Schultink et al., 2013) or that have reduced (Zabotina et al., 2008;Vuttipongchaikij et al., 2012;Zabotina et al., 2012) or no discernible amounts ofXyG(Cavalier et al., 2008) have no severe developmental or growth phenotypes. This has led plant scientists to question the biological role ofXyGin wall assembly and architecture as well as its function in plant growth and development (Cavalier et al., 2008;Park and Cosgrove, 2012a,2012b). Arabidopsismur3-1andmur3-2mutants, which carry different single-point mutations inMUR3,have been reported to formXyGthat lacks F side chains (Madson et al., 2003;Peña et al., 2004), although they do produce discernible amounts of the MUR3 protein (Tamura et al., 2005). Both of these mutants are visibly similar to wild-type plants (Madson et al., 2003;Peña et al., 2004;Tamura et al., 2005). By contrast, mutant plants includingkatamari1 (kam1-1, kam1-2/mur3-7, and kam1-3/mur3-3;Tamura et al., 2005;Tedman-Jones et al., 2008),constitutive ICS1:luc expression1(Tedman-Jones et al., 2008), andshort root in salt medium(rsa3;Li et al., 2013), which are devoid of functional MUR3, have a dwarf cabbage-like growth phenotype with curled rosette leaves, short petioles, and endomembrane aggregates.Tamura et al. (2005)have proposed that the KAM1/MUR3 protein itself, rather than its galactosyltransferase activity, is required for cell elongation and normal endomembrane organization. This hypothesis is based in part on the assumption that themur3-1,mur3-2, andmur3-3/kam1-3mutants all lack MUR3 galactosyltransferase activity, but only themur3-3/kam1-3mutant lacks the MUR3 protein itself (Tamura et al., 2005). Here, we provide genetic and chemical evidence thatXyGdeficient in extended side chains is dysfunctional and is responsible for the growth defects ofmur3-3andmur3-7plants. The extent ofXyGgalactosylation is the major factor in determining these effects. The deleterious growth effects caused by this dysfunctionalXyGare suppressed by introducing additional mutations that eliminateXyGformation altogether, by mutations that modifyXyGstructure, or by altering the plant's growth conditions. These observations provide new insight intoXyGbiosynthesis and the structural requirements that allowXyGto function normally in plant growth and development. ReducingXyGto below Detectable Levels Suppresses the Dwarf Phenotype ofmur3-3Plants MUR3encodes anXyG-specific galactosyltransferase responsible for most of the galactosylation of ArabidopsisXyG. To address the possibility that alteredXyGstructure leads to the phenotypes of Arabidopsis plants lacking functional MUR3, we took a genetic approach to reduce the amounts ofXyGto undetectable levels in themur3-3mutant. Thus, we crossedmur3-3with thexxt1 xxt2double mutant, which has no detectable amounts ofXyGin its cell wall (Cavalier et al., 2008;Zabotina et al., 2012). Thexxt1 xxt2mutant grows somewhat more slowly than wild-type plants but does not have a cabbage-like phenotype (Cavalier et al., 2008) or abnormal endomembrane aggregates (Uehara et al., 2014), making it visibly distinct from themur3-3mutant (Fig. 1C). Thexxt1 xxt2 mur3-3triple mutant, which produces no discernibleXXT1,XXT2, orMUR3transcripts (Supplemental Fig. S1A), does not have a cabbage-like phenotype and is visibly indistinguishable from thexxt1 xxt2mutant (Fig. 1C). Toluidine blue-stained cross sections of wild-type,xxt1 xxt2, andxxt1 xxt2 mur3-3leaves are also visibly similar (Fig. 1E). Most of themur3-3cells are smaller than their wild-type counterparts, a result that is in agreement with the proposal that these cells have lost the ability to expand normally (Tamura et al., 2005). Glycome profiling (Fig. 1D) and immunocytochemistry (Fig. 1E) indicate that theXyGpresent inmur3-3walls is not fucosylated, whereas wild-type walls contain fucosylatedXyG. No discernible amounts ofXyGwere detected inxxt1 xxt2 mur3-3leaf cell walls (Fig. 1, D and E), nor were xyloglucan oligosaccharides (XyGOs) detected afterXyG-specific endoglucanase (XEG) treatment of the 1 and 4nKOH-soluble materials fromxxt1 xxt2 mur3-3root, leaf, and stem cell walls. Thus, the presence ofXyGis strongly correlated with the cabbage-like phenotype of themur3-3mutant. Our data suggest that the absence of the MUR3 galactosyltransferase leads to the formation of dysfunctionalXyG, and that cellular processes are affected more by the presence of this dysfunctional xyloglucan than by eliminatingXyGaltogether. Themur3-1,mur3-2, mur3-3, andmur3-7Phenotypes Are Associated with AlteredXyGChemotypes Since the presence of dysfunctionalXyGis correlated with the cabbage-like phenotype ofmur3-3plants, we next determined the structural features ofXyGthat are associated with this phenotype. To this end, theXyGs frommur3-1,mur3-2,mur3-3, andmur3-7, each of which carries a different mutation inMUR3(Supplemental Fig. S1B), were structurally characterized. The structures of theseXyGs have not previously been compared, since only the distinguishing chemical structures of themur3-1XyGhave been described (Madson et al., 2003;Peña et al., 2004). Here, theXyGOs generated byXEGfragmentation of leafXyGobtained from each mutant grown at 19°C (Fig. 2) were characterized using1H-NMR spectroscopy (Hoffman et al., 2005), matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS), and high-performance anion-exchange chromatography (HPAEC) with pulsed-amperometric detection (PAD;Tuomivaara et al., 2015). The phenotypes of Arabidopsis plants carrying mutations in one or more of the genes encoding the xyloglucan-specific galactosyltransferases MUR3 and XLT2. Plants were grown with a 14-h-light (19°C) and 10-h-dark (15°C) cycle or with a 14-h-light (28°C) and 10-h-dark (24°C) cycle. Images were taken when the plants were 4 weeks old. Homozygousmur3-3andmur3-7plants, respectively, carry a transfer DNA insertion in the region encoding the exostosin-like domain and the protein’s N terminus (Tedman-Jones et al., 2008;Supplemental Fig. S1B). Both mutants produce no detectableMUR3transcripts (Supplemental Fig. S1A) and have a cabbage-like phenotype when grown at 19°C in soil (Fig. 2). These mutants are visibly distinct from themur3-1andmur3-2mutants (Fig. 2), both of which produce detectable amounts of the MUR3 protein (Tamura et al., 2005). The1H-NMR spectrum of themur3-3XyGOs contained no discernible signals corresponding to an F side chain at any position or to an L side chain adjacent to the unbranched Glc residue (Fig. 3;Supplemental Table S1).MALDI-TOFMSandHPAEC-PADconfirmed that themur3-3XyGis composed entirely of XXXG (63%) and XLXG (37%) subunits (Fig. 4A;Supplemental Fig. S2, A and B). Themur3-7XyGis also composed of XXXG (73%) and XLXG (27%) subunits (Fig. 4A;Supplemental Fig. S3). OverexpressingMUR3under the control of a 35S promoter in themur3-3mutant rescued the cabbage-like phenotype (Supplemental Fig. S4) and led to the synthesis ofXyGcontaining near wild-type levels of XXFG and XLFG subunits (Fig. 4A;Supplemental Fig. S3). These analyses are in agreement with previous studies showing that MUR3 is a regiospecific galactosyltransferase that adds a Gal residue to the Xyl adjacent to the unbranched Glc in theXyGbackbone (Madson et al., 2003;Peña et al., 2004). Partial 600-MHz1H-NMR spectra of theXyGoligosaccharides generated byXEGtreatment of the 4nKOH-solubleXyGfrom wild-type (Col-0),mur3-1,mur3-2, andmur3-3leaf cell walls. Plants were grown with a 14-h-light (19°C) and 10-h-dark (15°C) cycle. The residues corresponding to each group of proton resonances (e.g. 2-Xyl) are indicated at the top of the wild-type spectrum. The location of these residues in a side chain (X, L, or F) is indicated. The amounts and subunit compositions of the xyloglucan present in the leaf cell walls of wild-type and selectedmur3mutant plants. A and B, The subunit compositions ofXyGpresent in wild-type and mutant leaves.XyGoligosaccharides were generated byXEGtreatment of the 4nKOH-soluble materials from at least three individual plants and analyzed byMALDI-TOFMS.HPAEC-PAD(Supplemental Fig. S2) and1H-NMR analyses (Supplemental Table S1) indicated that XXLG and XLLG account for between 6% and 9% of the subunits inCol-0and35SproMUR3:mur3-3XyG. These subunits were not detected in any of the other plants. C, The amounts of Driselase-susceptibleXyGin wild-type and mutant leaves determined from the amounts of isoprimeverose released by Driselase treatment of the cell walls. Our data show that the S470L amino acid substitution inmur3-1has a more severe effect on xyloglucan galactosylation than the A290V substitution inmur3-2. Indeed, themur3-1andmur3-2mutants are not identical, since the etiolated hypocotyls ofmur3-1are approximately 50% shorter than theirmur3-2counterparts (Supplemental Fig. S6).Li et al. (2013)have reported that the roots of themur3-1andmur3-2plants are somewhat less sensitive to salt stress than theirrsa3-1andkam1-3counterparts and concluded that RSA3/MUR3/KAM1 is important in the salt stress tolerance pathway. We extend this notion by proposing that the phenotype of eachmur3mutant is determined in large part by the extent of residual xyloglucan galactosylation at the MUR3-specific position. Xyloglucan Side Chain Extension Is Increased and the Cabbage-Like Phenotype ofmur3-3andmur3-7Plants Is Suppressed by Overexpression of XLT2 The phenotypes of Arabidopsis plants carrying mutations in one or more of the genes encoding the xyloglucan-specific galactosyltransferases MUR3 or the xylosyltransferases XXT1, XXT2, and XXT5. Plants were grown with a 14-h-light (19°C) and 10-h-dark (15°C) cycle. Images were taken when the plants were 4 weeks old. The Phenotypes ofmur3-3andmur3-7Plants Are Suppressed by Knocking outXXT2orXXT5 Plants that had a wild-type phenotype, yet were genotyped asXXT1 xxt2 mur3-3,were obtained during the generation of thexxt1 xxt2 mur3-3triple mutant, which led us to suspect that abolishing the expression of specificXXTgenes suppressed the cabbage-like phenotype. To obtain experimental support for this hypothesis, we generated a series of double mutants by crossingmur3-3andmur3-7with thexxt1, xxt2, and xxt5mutants (seeFig. 5), which themselves have wild-type phenotypes (Cavalier et al., 2008;Vuttipongchaikij et al., 2012;Zabotina et al., 2012). Thexxt2-1 mur3-3, xxt2-2 mur3-7,xxt5 mur3-3, andxxt5 mur3-7mutants were phenotypically comparable with wild-type plants (Fig. 4). The walls of these four double mutants contain 35% to 50% less Driselase-susceptibleXyGthan the walls of thexxt1 mur3-3,mur3-3, andmur3-7mutants (Fig. 4C;Supplemental Table S2). Notably, XLXG subunits accounted for at least 59% of theXyGin the normal-lookingxxt2-1 mur3-3, xxt2-2 mur3-7,xxt5 mur3-3, andxxt5 mur3-7mutant plants (Fig. 4B;Supplemental Fig. S4). By contrast, the XLXG subunit accounts for 44% of theXyGfrom thexxt1 mur3-3double mutant (Fig. 4B;Supplemental Fig. S3), which retained the cabbage-like phenotype (Fig. 5). Such data are again consistent with the notion that this phenotype is a consequence of the synthesis ofXyGdeficient in extended side chains. Tamura et al. (2005)have proposed that the cabbage-like phenotype ofkam1/mur3mutant plants is a consequence of abnormal endomembrane organization resulting from the absence of the MUR3 protein. However, the endomembrane aggregation phenotype observed inmur3-3plants was largely suppressed in thexxt2-1 mur3-3andxxt5 mur3-3mutant plants (Fig. 6A) but not in thexxt1 mur3-3mutant. Our data are thus consistent with the notion thatXyGwith a high proportion of unsubstituted XXXG subunits is dysfunctional, and that its presence, rather than the absence of a functional MUR3 protein, is strongly correlated with the presence of endomembrane aggregates. Swollen epidermal cells with endomembrane aggregates have been observed in the roots of plants lacking an isoform of UDP-Glc 4-epimerase (uge4;Uehara et al., 2014). Theuge4rootXyGcontains approximately 50% less Gal than wild-typeXyG(Nguema-Ona et al., 2006;Rösti et al., 2007). Membrane aggregation and cell bulging were suppressed by growinguge4in the presence of Gal, which led to the suggestion that reduced galactosylation ofXyGor arabinogalactan protein is responsible for endomembrane disorganization (Uehara et al., 2014). Nevertheless, a direct causal relationship between endomembrane aggregation and plant growth is unlikely, as Arabidopsis plants carrying a mutation in the coat promoter complex II coat protein SECRETORY 24A have endomembrane aggregates comparable tomur3-3but are not dwarfed (Faso et al., 2009). Endomembrane aggregation and intracellular accumulation of cell wall polysaccharides inmur3-3plants. A, Endomembrane aggregation inmur3-3plants is suppressed by knocking outXXT2orXXT5.Col-0(wild-type [WT]) and mutant plants were individually transformed with the SP-2SC-GFP (for signal peptide of pumpkin 2S albumin followed by a linker of GGG and the C-terminal 18-amino acid sequence of pumpkin 2S albumin) construct and grown with a 14-h-light (19°C) and 10-h-dark (15°C) cycle or a 14-h-light (28°C) and 10-h-dark (24°C) cycle. Images of epidermal cells of 14-d-old cotyledons expressing the endomembrane-targeted SP-2SC-GFP were obtained using an inverted laser scanning confocal microscope. Bar = 10 µm. B, Immunocytochemistry reveals intracellular aggregates (see arrows) containingXyGand pectin inmur3hypocotyls. Top, Toluidine blue-stained cross sections. CCRC-M88 recognizesXyG, CCRC-M1 recognizes fucosylatedXyG, and CCRC-M38 recognizes deesterified homogalacturonan. Bar = 50 µm. Intracellular Aggregates Containing Xyloglucan and Pectin Accumulate in the Cells ofmur3-3Hypocotyls Pectic and hemicellulosic polysaccharides are believed to be synthesized in the Golgi apparatus and are then transferred from the trans-Golgi network in vesicles that move to and fuse with the plasma membrane (Bashline et al., 2014). The polysaccharides are then released into the apoplast and incorporated into the existing cell wall. Defects in trans-Golgi network-dependent secretion of polysaccharides in theechidnamutant have been shown to result in the accumulation of intracellular aggregates containing pectin and xyloglucan (Gendre et al., 2013). Thus, we examined polysaccharide secretion inmur3-3, as its cells contain abnormal endomembrane aggregates (Fig. 6A). Intracellular aggregates were clearly visible in the epidermal cells of a toluidine blue-stained cross section of themur3-3hypocotyl (Fig. 6B;Supplemental Fig. S8A). Smaller amounts of aggregates were also visible inmur3-1hypocotyls (Fig. 6B). These aggregates were labeled with monoclonal antibodies that recognize xyloglucan and deesterified homogalacturonan (Fig. 6B). Few, if any, aggregates were discernible inmur3-2,wild-type (Fig. 6B), or35SproMUR3:mur3-3hypocotyls (Supplemental Fig. S8B). Taken together, these data provide evidence that, inmur3-3hypocotyls and to a lesser extent inmur3-1hypocotyls, cell wall matrix polysaccharides, including xyloglucan and pectins, are not properly secreted and instead accumulate within intracellular aggregates. These data again support the notion that the phenotype of eachmur3mutant is determined in large part by the amount of catalytically functional MUR3 protein it produces. Temperature Affects the Growth ofmur3Plants and the Catalytic Activity of the Mutated MUR3 Protein Early studies reported thatmur3-1XyGlacks F side chains (Madson et al., 2003;Peña et al., 2004), although subsequent analyses indicated that fucosylated subunits account for up to 5% of themur3-1andxlt2 mur3-1XyGs (Jensen et al., 2012;Schultink et al., 2013;Vinueza et al., 2013). Nevertheless, those values are lower than the values we obtained (Fig. 4A). As our plants were grown at 19°C rather than at 22°C or 26°C as in the earlier studies, we determined whether temperature affects the extent ofXyGfucosylation or plant growth. There was an approximately 85% decrease in the relative abundance of the fucosylated subunits in theXyGfrommur3-1andxlt2 mur3-1plants grown at 28°C (Fig. 7, A and B;Supplemental Fig. S9).xlt2 mur3-1mutants grown at 19°C or 28°C do not have a severe cabbage-like phenotype but do have short petioles and slightly curved leaves, making them visibly distinct from wild-type plants (Fig. 2). The relative abundance of the fucosylated subunits inmur3-2XyGwas comparable at both growth temperatures (Fig. 7;Supplemental Fig. S9). These data confirm thatmur3-1andmur3-2plants retain a residual amount of MUR3 activity and show that, in plants with the allelic (S470L) MUR3-1 protein,XyGgalactosylation at the MUR3 position is diminished by increasing growth temperature. The effect of growth temperature on the xyloglucan subunit compositions of selectedmur3and wild-type plants. A,XyGsubunit compositions of plants grown with a 14-h-light (19°C) and 10-h-dark (15°C) cycle. B,XyGsubunit compositions of plants grown with a 14-h-light (28°C) and 10-h-dark (24°C) cycle.XyGoligosaccharides were generated byXEGtreatment of the 4nKOH-soluble materials from at least three individual plants and analyzed byMALDI-TOFMS.HPAEC-PADanalyses indicated that XXLG and XLLG accounted for approximately 6% of the subunits inCol-0XyG(seeSupplemental Fig. S9). Dysfunctional Xyloglucan and Plant Growth Our data show that the extent of side chain galactosylation inmur3-3andmur3-7XyGis reduced by approximately 70% compared with the wild type. A probability analysis (seeSupplemental Protocol S1) using the XXXG subunit abundance in theXyGfrommur3-3(63%),mur3-7(73%), the wild type (25%),mur3-1(48%),mur3-2(47%), and35SproMUR3:mur3-3(29%) plants predicts that domains consisting of five or more tandemly repeated XXXG sequences comprise a much higher proportion of theXyGinmur3-3andmur3-7plants than inXyGfrom the other plants (Supplemental Fig. S11). The existence of large tandemly repeated XXXG domains may lead to the aggregation or otherwise aberrant interactions ofXyGwith itself and/or with other wall polymers (Shirakawa et al., 1998;Whitney et al., 2006;de Freitas et al., 2011). Such interactions together with the inability to extend the side chain adjacent to the unbranched Glc appear to be major factors in the dysfunctional properties of themur3-3andmur3-7XyGand the cabbage-like phenotype of these plants. The aggregation of the nascentmur3-3andmur3-7XyGs may prevent the normal movement ofXyGthrough the Golgi and the packaging ofXyGin vesicles for delivery to the apoplast, and may also account for the abnormal membrane organization and the accumulation of intracellular aggregates containing wall polysaccharides inmur3-3plants. The differences in subunit composition of themur3-3andxlt2 mur3-1XyGs (Fig. 7) indicate that failure to extend the side chains next to the unbranched Glc is especially detrimental toXyGfunction and to plant growth. Most, if not all, of the galactosyl residues adjacent to the unbranched Glc are further extended with Fuc in theXyGpresent in the wall ofxlt2 mur3-1plants. AlthoughXyGfucosylation is not in itself required for the normal growth of laboratory-grown Arabidopsis plants (Vanzin et al., 2002), there is evidence that fucosylation does have a role, albeit less than galactosylation, in the formation ofXyG-cellulose composites (Whitney et al., 2006). Our data favor a model that invokes a dysfunctional xyloglucan structure as the most direct cause of the growth defects of plants carrying loss-of-function mutations inMUR3. Nevertheless, the possibility cannot be discounted that other cellular mechanisms are responsible. For example, the phenotypes observed in plants lacking the MUR3 protein may be a consequence of anXyGbiosynthesis complex (Chou et al., 2015;Lund et al., 2015) that becomes dysfunctional when no MUR3 protein is present. In this scenario, themur3-1andmur3-2mutants are not cabbage like because the residual MUR3 may still be capable of forming a nondysfunctionalXyGbiosynthetic complex. However, to be consistent with our data, XLT2, which has 42% amino acid sequence identity with MUR3, must be able to substitute for MUR3 to form a nondysfunctional complex whenXLT2is expressed at sufficiently high levels.XLT2does not replaceMUR3when expressed at normal levels. This model also requires that the direct effects of the putative dysfunctional biosynthetic complex are suppressed by eliminating the XXT2 or the XXT5 protein inmur3-3ormur3-7plants. Thexxt2 mur3-3andxxt5 mur3-3double mutants have near wild-type morphology and produce xyloglucan with less than 50% unsubstituted XXXG. Models that invoke a dysfunctional biosynthetic complex as the direct cause of themur3-3phenotypes are thus complicated by several difficult-to-reconcile requirements. We have shown that Arabidopsis mutants devoid of the F side chain galactosyltransferase MURUS3 form xyloglucan that lacks F side chains and contains much less galactosylated Xyl than wild-type xyloglucan. This xyloglucan structure is dysfunctional, as it leads to mutants that exhibit numerous growth defects. Near-normal growth is restored by eliminating the xyloglucan altogether or by increasing the extent of its galactosylation. The altered growth of themur3family of mutants and their responses to temperature, pathogens (Tedman-Jones et al., 2008), and salt stress (Li et al., 2013) reveal how modifying one element of a biochemical network, in this case, xyloglucan biosynthesis, may disturb diverse cellular and physiological processes. Such data provide additional evidence in support of the notion that altering wall structure affects numerous aspects of plant life (Seifert and Blaukopf, 2010). Thus, themur3mutants provide a unique opportunity to increase our understanding of how changes in cell wall biosynthesis and structure affect plant growth and development as well as disease resistance and responses to environmental stimuli. All primers used in this study are listed inSupplemental Table S3. Plants were grown in controlled-environmental growth chambers (Adaptis 2000, Conviron). Seeds were germinated and grown on Fafard 3B potting soil at 19°C and 15°C with a 14-h-light and 10-h-dark cycle, respectively, with a light intensity of 120 µmol quanta m−2s−1and 70% relative humidity. In a second series of experiments, wild-type and mutant seeds were germinated and grown for 10 d on Fafard 3B potting soil at 19°C and 15°C with a 14-h-light and 10-h-dark cycle, respectively. One-half of the plants was then transferred to a second controlled environmental growth cabinet operated at 28°C and 24°C with a 14-h-light and 10-h-dark cycle, respectively. Images of plants were obtained using a Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ28 digital camera. All image manipulations were performed using Adobe Photoshop CS4 software. Double and Triple Mutant Generation Thexxt1 xxt2-1double mutant was crossed with themur3-3mutant. Segregating progenies homozygous forxxt1 mur3-3, xxt2-1 mur3-3, andxxt1 xxt2 mur3-3were identified in the subsequent F2 and F3 generations. Double mutants were generated by crossingmur3-3ormur3-7withxxt1, xxt2-1, xxt2-2,orxxt5. Allele-specific primers for each line were used to identify homozygous mutant alleles by PCR. Total RNA was isolated from the leaves of wild-type and mutant plants using an RNeasy plant mini kit with an on-column DNase I treatment to remove contaminating genomic DNA, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). One microgram of total RNA was reverse transcribed using Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen), and one-twentieth of the first-strand complementary DNA was used for PCR amplification with gene-specific primers. Actin-2 was used as an internal control with primers to amplify a complementary DNA fragment. Plasmid Construction and Plant Transformation The full-lengthXLT2open reading frame was PCR amplified with primers XLT2-OE F and XLT2-OE R and then inserted downstream of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter in thepCam35tl:egfps2#4vector (Pattathil et al., 2005). The construct was transformed intoAgrobacterium tumefaciensstrain GV3101, which was then used to transform themur3-3mutant using a floral dip procedure (Clough and Bent, 1998). Transgenic plants were selected by growth on one-half-strength Murashige and Skoog medium containing hygromycin (15 mg L−1). The presence of the transgene was confirmed by PCR using the gene-specific primer XLT2 F paired with vector-specific primer P1300 R. Preparation of the Alcohol-Insoluble Residues and Solubilization of Xyloglucan Cell walls from the aerial portions of wild-type and mutant plants were prepared as their alcohol-insoluble residues (AIRs). The tissues were homogenized in aqueous 80% (v/v) ethanol using a Polytron blender (Kinematica). The suspension was centrifuged and the insoluble residue washed with absolute ethanol and acetone and then vacuum dried at room temperature. TheAIR(0.5–1.0 g) was then treated sequentially for 16 h at room temperature with 50 mmammonium oxalate (50 mL), 1nKOH containing 0.5% (w/v) sodium borohydride, and then with 4nKOH containing 0.5% (w/v) sodium borohydride. The 4nKOH extract, which contains most of the xyloglucan, was adjusted to pH 5 with glacial acetic acid, dialyzed against several changes of deionized water, and freeze dried. Structural Characterization of Xyloglucan Oligosaccharides Xyloglucan oligosaccharides were generated by treating suspensions of theAIRand solutions of the 4nKOH-soluble materials in 50 mmammonium formate, pH 5, with anXEGas described (Pauly et al., 1999). Ethanol was added to 70% (v/v) and the mixture kept for 24 h at 4°C. The precipitate that formed was removed by centrifugation and the soluble fraction concentrated to dryness. The residue was dissolved in 500 μL of water and then freeze dried to remove residual ammonium formate. Positive-ionMALDI-TOFmass spectra were recorded using a Bruker Microflex LT mass spectrometer and workstation. Solutions (5 μL) of the oligosaccharides (approximately 1 mg mL−1in water) were mixed with an equal volume of 10 mmNaCl. A portion of this mixture (1 μL) was then added to a matrix solution (0.1m2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in aqueous 50% [v/v] acetonitrile, 1 μL) on the stainless steel MALDI target plate and concentrated to dryness using a flow of warm air from a hair dryer. Spectra from at least 200 laser shots were summed up to generate each mass spectrum. 1H-NMR spectra were recorded with a Varian Inova NMR spectrometer (Agilent Technologies) operating at 600 MHz using a 3-mm cold probe and a sample temperature of 25°C.XyGOs (0.5–1 mg) were dissolved in D2O (0.7 mL, 99.9% [v/v]; Cambridge Isotope Laboratories). All two-dimensional spectra were recorded using standard Varian pulse programs. Chemical shifts were measured relative to internal acetone (δ 2.225). Data were processed using MestReNova software (Universidad de Santiago de Compostela). The amounts of xyloglucan present in theAIRwere determined by measuring the amounts of isoprimeverose released by Driselase treatment of theAIR(Fry, 1982). Suspensions of theAIR(approximately 1 g) from mutant and wild-type plants in aqueous 80% (v/v) ethanol (100 mL) were ball milled for 16 h at 4°C and 90 rpm in ceramic milling jars (0.3 L) containing a mixture of one-fourth- and one-half-inch zirconia milling beads (U.S. Stoneware). The milledAIRwas collected by centrifugation, washed with absolute ethanol and then with acetone, and then vacuum dried at room temperature. Suspensions of the milledAIR(250–500 mg) in 50 mmsodium acetate, pH 5.2 (30 mL), were then treated for 24 h at 45°C with Spirizyme (30 μL, Novozymes A/S) and Liquizyme (150 μL, Novozymes A/S) to remove starch. The destarchedAIRwas collected by centrifugation, washed thoroughly with deionized water, and freeze dried. Triplicate suspensions of theAIR(6.25 mg) in 50 mmammonium formate, pH 4.7 (500 μL), containing 0.5% (w/v) chlorobutanol were treated for 24 h at 22°C with 0.25% (w/v) Driselase (100 μL, Sigma-Aldrich) prepared as described (Fry, 1982). A second portion of Driselase (50 μL) was added and the suspension kept for a further 24 h at 22°C. Ethanol (1.5 mL) was added and the mixture kept at 4°C overnight. The suspension was centrifuged and the soluble fraction concentrated to dryness. The residue was dissolved in water (1 mL) and freeze dried to remove residual ammonium formate. The residue was dissolved in water (1 mL), and a portion (250 μL) was filtered using a 0.45-μm centrifugal microfilter. Portions (10 μL) of the soluble material were then analyzed using a Dionex ICS-3000HPAECsystem with pulsed amperometric detection and a CarboPac PA1 column (250 × 4.6 mm, Thermo Fisher). The column was eluted at 1.0 mL min−1for 5 min with 0.1nNaOH, then with a gradient of sodium acetate (0–100 mm) in 0.1nNaOH for 30 min. The column was washed for 15 min with 1msodium acetate in 0.1nNaOH and then reequilibrated for 15 min in 0.1nNaOH. The chromatography system was calibrated using known amounts of isoprimeverose (Megazyme). Xyloglucan Subunit Composition Analysis UsingHPAECwith Pulsed Amperometric Detection Solutions (10 μL) ofXyGOs in water (approximately 200 μg mL−1) released byXEGtreatment ofAIRor the 4nKOH-soluble materials were analyzed using a Dionex ICS-3000 system and CarboPac PA1 column (250 × 4.6 mm; Thermo Fisher). The column was eluted at 1.0 mL min−1for 3 min with 0.1nNaOH, from 3 to 5 min with a gradient of sodium acetate (0–40 mm) in 0.1nNaOH and from 5 to 38 min with a gradient of sodium acetate (40–100 mm) in 0.1nNaOH. The column was washed with 1msodium acetate in 0.1nNaOH for 7 min and reequilibrated for 15 min in 0.1nNaOH. The column was calibrated using known amounts (0.5–2 μg injected) of homogeneous XXXG, XXLG, XLXG, XXFG, XLLG, and XLFG purified fromXEGdigests of tamarind and sycamore cell wall xyloglucan (Tuomivaara et al., 2015). Glycome Profiling of Plant Cell Wall Extracts AIRgenerated from wild-type and mutant plants (approximately 500 mg) was treated sequentially with α-amylase, endopolygalacturonase, 50 mmsodium carbonate, 1nKOH, 4nKOH, and 5nKOH containing 3% (w/v) boric acid to generate fractions enriched in pectic and hemicellulosic polysaccharides. The soluble extracts were adjusted to pH 5 if required, dialyzed (3,500Mrcutoff) against deionized water, and freeze dried. Solutions (50 µL) of each wall extract (60 µg total sugar mL−1water) were then used for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays using monoclonal antibodies that recognize xyloglucan epitopes (seeSupplemental Table S4) as described (Pattathil et al., 2010). Confocal Imaging of Endomembrane Organization Col-0,mur3-3,xxt1 mur3-3,xxt2-1 mur3-3, andxxt5 mur3-3plants were individually transformed with the SP-2SC-GFP construct (Mitsuhashi et al., 2000;Tamura et al., 2005). Transgenic plants were obtained by screening the seeds on kanamycin plates. Epidermal cells of 14-d-old cotyledons were analyzed using an inverted laser scanning confocal microscope (LSM510 META, Zeiss) as described (Faso et al., 2009). Leaves from 4-week-old soil-grownCol-0,mur3-3, xxt1 xxt2,andxxt1 xxt2 mur3-3plants and hypocotyls fromCol-0,mur3-1,mur3-2,mur3-3,andmur3-3:35SproMUR3seedlings grown for 4 d under constant light at 22°C were fixed for 3 h in 25 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.1, containing 2.5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde. The fixed leaves and hypocotyls were processed for light microscopy as described previously (Avci et al., 2012). Hypocotyl cross sections approximately 3 to 4 mm away from the shoot meristem and leaf cross sections (250 nm thick) approximately 3 to 4 mm away from the leaf tip were mounted on ColorFrost Plus glass slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and blocked for 30 min with 10 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.1, containing 0.5mNaCl and 3% (w/v) nonfat dry milk. Hypocotyl and leaf cross sections were processed for immunolabeling with monoclonal antibodies CCRC-M1, CCRC-M38, or CCRC-M88 as described (Avci et al., 2012).
