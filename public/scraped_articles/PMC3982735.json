In the epidermis of Arabidopsis leaves, flavonols specifically accumulate in guard cells with enhanced synthesis in the presence of ethylene, where they lower the levels of reactive oxygen species and reduce the rate of stomatal closure. Guard cells use an extensive signal transduction pathway to regulate the aperture of stomata, pores on the surface of leaves that facilitate gas exchange and water loss (Roelfsema and Hedrich, 2005;Joshi-Saha et al., 2011). CO2, a necessary reactant for photosynthesis, enters leaves through stomata, whereas water can leave through these same pores via transpiration. Excess water loss can lead to dehydration of the plant when there is excess heat or drought. Guard cells therefore must modulate the stomatal aperture in response to the changing environment (Hirayama and Shinozaki, 2007). In response to stimuli that close stomata, such as drought stress, the hormone abscisic acid (ABA) is increased in the cytosol of guard cells (Zeevaart, 1980;Hirayama and Shinozaki (2007)).ABAinduces ion movements across the cell membrane expelling K+and Cl−ions through ion efflux channels. The decreased internal solute concentration drives water out of the cell via osmosis (Vahisalu et al., 2008). The loss of water from guard cells decreases the volume of the cell, with the resulting loss of turgor closing the stoma (Joshi-Saha et al., 2011). Additional understanding of this elegant signaling pathway will provide insight into how plant growth and development is modulated by changes in soil moisture, temperature, and light levels. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are one important class of signaling molecules that has been implicated in guard cell signaling (Guan et al., 2000;Zhang et al., 2001;Jiang and Zhang, 2002,2003). The well-documented role ofROSin causing oxidative stress is now joined with growing evidence thatROSmay play integral roles as secondary messengers in signal transduction pathways (Wood et al., 2003;Rhee, 2006;Mittler et al., 2011;Munné-Bosch et al., 2013). At high concentrations,ROS, such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), can cause oxidative damage to DNA and proteins that are integral to normal cellular processes (Asada, 2006;Van Breusegem and Dat, 2006); however, at low levels,H2O2is an effective signaling molecule in guard cells that can induce stomatal closure (Pei et al., 2000;Murata et al., 2001;Zhang et al., 2001;Kwak et al., 2003). ElevatedABAin guard cells triggersH2O2production through activation of NADPH or respiratory burst oxidase enzymes located on the plasma membrane (Mustilli et al., 2002;Yoshida et al., 2002) and mutants inArabidopsis thaliana respiratory burst oxidase D(AtrbohD) andAtrbohF, show impairedABA-regulated stomatal closure (Kwak et al., 2003). The ability of signaling-regulated synthesis ofH2O2to alter the activity of specific target proteins has been shown in mammalian systems (Rhee, 2006). This oxidant, generated from superoxide O2.−molecules, can modulate the activity of phosphatases and kinases, causing dynamic changes in signal transduction pathways (Poole et al., 2004). Specifically,H2O2can interact with specific Cys residues, transforming the functional group of the Cys into sulfenic acid, altering formation of disulfide bonds between two separate proteins or between nearby Cys residues of the same protein, in a transient, reversible fashion (Poole et al., 2004;Poole and Nelson, 2008). In guard cells, thisROSburst is believed to target calcium channels to promote the influx of calcium across the plasma membrane and the release of calcium from internal stores (McAinsh et al., 1996;Allen et al., 2000;Cho et al., 2009). Increased cytosolic calcium levels induce activation of anion efflux channels located on the plasma membrane (Hedrich et al., 1990;Schroeder and Hagiwara, 1990;Chen et al., 2010;Wang et al., 2013), triggering stomatal closure. The mechanism behindROSactivation of Ca2+channels in mammalian systems has been well studied (Poole and Nelson, 2008); however, less is known about this mechanism in plants. When maintained at manageable levels,ROSare efficient and reversible signaling molecules employed by cells to regulate the activity of enzymes and transcription factors; however, if levels of these molecules become excessively elevated, they can cause oxidative stress (Hernández et al., 2009;Pollastri and Tattini, 2011). Therefore, mechanisms that keep their levels from becoming too high and allow their accumulation to be transient are important features ofROSsignaling.ROShomeostasis is tightly regulated in plants through the production of a variety of enzymatic and small molecule antioxidants (Mittler et al., 2004). Flavonols are plant metabolites that may function as antioxidants in plants and in animals that consume them (Hernández et al., 2009). Although their antioxidant activity in planta has been debated, previous studies have shown that the antioxidant capacity for flavonols in vitro is greater than that of vitamin C or E, two well-documented in planta antioxidants (Rice-Evans et al., 1997). Guard cells provide an elegant system to test the antioxidant ability of flavonols, owing to the well-documented function ofROSas a second messenger in this cell type (Pei et al., 2000;Murata et al., 2001;Kwak et al., 2003;Cho et al., 2009). Flavonols and Their Biosynthetic Machinery Are Found in Guard Cells Flavonols accumulate in guard cells. A, Confocal micrograph showed yellowDPBAfluorescence in guard cells, but not pavement cells. B,DICimage overlaid on a confocal micrograph of wild-type leaves showing the location of yellowDPBAfluorescence. C, Bright-field image showsCHS:GUSexpression in guard cells, but not pavement cells of wild-type plants. Bar = 15 μm. To more quantitatively and precisely imageDPBAin leaf tissue, we optimized laser scanning confocal microscope (LSCM) settings in order to spectrally separate total flavonol fluorescence from chlorophyll autofluorescence. Using the basal surface of a whole Arabidopsis leaf, confocal micrographs showed autofluorescence of chlorophyll in the blue channel andDPBAstaining in the yellow channel (Fig. 2). The absence of theDPBAsignal intt4-2guard cells confirmed the specificity of this staining in leaf tissues, complementing the previous studies in roots (Buer and Muday, 2004;Lewis et al., 2011). This image indicated that we can resolve these two fluorescent signals and that flavonols accumulated in the cytosol, but not the chloroplasts of guard cells. It was also evident thatDPBAfluorescence was greater in the regions of the guard cell that appeared to be nuclei, a cellular location that exhibited flavonoid accumulation in other plant cells types (Feucht et al., 2004;Saslowsky et al., 2005;Lewis et al., 2011). Verification of nuclear flavonol accumulation was completed by simultaneously imagingDPBAand Hoechst 33258, a nucleic acid stain (Supplemental Fig. S1). After imagingDPBAwith spectral separation, we imaged the same guard cells using single-channel microscopy to visualize Hoechst fluorescence and consistently observed that the region of brightDPBAstaining in the center of each guard cell also had nucleic acids, as detected by Hoechst, consistent with a nuclear accumulation of flavonols. Flavonol accumulation is absent intt4guard cells and enhanced ineto1guard cells.DPBAbound to flavonols is shown in yellow and chlorophyll autofluorescence is shown in blue. Bar = 15 μm. Flavonol Accumulation in Guard Cells AffectsABA-Induced Stomatal Closure Stomatal aperture ofCol-0andtt4in response toABA.ABAsensitivity is indirectly proportional to relative flavonol concentration. Guard cells were incubated under white light in a 20-μMABAsolution for 0, 45, 90, and 180 min. The average ±seof 90 stomata from three biological replicates are reported. Asterisks indicate significant differences (P< 0.05) between the mutant andCol-0at each time point as determined by the Student’sttest. Elevated Ethylene Levels through Exogenous Treatment or in theethylene-overproducing1Mutant Increase Flavonol Accumulation Because elevated ethylene levels were previously shown to increase flavonol accumulation in Arabidopsis roots (Lewis et al., 2011), we asked whether there is similar regulation in guard cells.DPBAfluorescence was examined in theethylene-overproducing1(eto1) mutant (Chae et al., 2003) and enhanced flavonol accumulation was observed in the guard cells (Fig. 2). TheDPBAfluorescence intensity was quantified in 90 stomata and average fluorescence is reported relative to the values in the cytosol ofCol-0(Fig. 3). There is a >1.6-fold increase inDPBAfluorescence in the cytosol and a >1.5-fold increase in the nuclei ofeto1guard cells compared with the wild type (Fig. 3;P< 0.001). To further examine the effect of ethylene on flavonol synthesis in guard cells, we treated plants with exogenous ethylene. The wild type and theethylene-insensitive2-5(ein2-5) mutant, an ethylene signaling mutant with nearly complete ethylene insensitivity (Alonso et al., 1999), were treated with 5 μL/L ethylene gas for 24 h, and thenDPBAfluorescence in the guard cells was imaged (Fig. 5). TheDPBAfluorescence was quantified in both the nucleus and cytosol, as described above, for 30 stomata per treatment in three separate experiments, and the average signal relative to the signal in the cytosol of untreatedCol-0was calculated (Fig. 5). Similar toeto1,the guard cells of ethylene-treated wild-type plants had enhancedDPBAfluorescence in the cytosol and nuclei compared with an untreated control (P< 0.01). A similar magnitude increase inDPBAfluorescence was also evident after 3 h of ethylene treatment, as shown inSupplemental Figure S3A. Guard cells ofein2-5had significantly lowerDPBAfluorescence thanCol-0in both the cytosol and nucleus in the absence of treatment (P< 0.02) and showed no increase inDPBAfluorescence after ethylene treatment (Fig. 5). Subcellular flavonol accumulation inCol-0andein2-5guard cells with and without ethylene treatment. Intact soil grown plants were incubated in ethylene gas at 5 μL/L concentration for 24 h.DPBAfluorescence intensity values were quantified and are reported relative to the untreatedCol-0cytosol fluorescence intensity. Asterisks indicate significant differences (P< 0.02) between the mutant and the wild type within treatment. Number signs indicate significant differences between treated and untreated controls within a genotype as determined by the Student’sttest (P< 0.02). The average ±seof 90 stomata from three biological replicates are reported. ROSAccumulate in Guard Cells and Are Affected by Flavonol Concentrations The concentrations ofROSare highly regulated in guard cells and are an essential feature of rapid stomatal closure in response toABA(Pei et al., 2000;Kwak et al., 2003).ROSconcentration within guard cells was examined to determine whether flavonols are acting as antioxidants in vivo. To visualizeROSaccumulation in Arabidopsis leaf tissue, we used 2',7' dihydrodichlorofluorescein diacetate (H2DCF-DA), a generalROSfluorescent sensor (Halliwell and Whiteman, 2004). In the past, this fluorescent probe has been imaged with UV light to visualizeROSin guard cells (Kwak et al., 2003); however, we excited with a 488-nm laser, a wavelength that is more frequently used when imaging this probe (Halliwell and Whiteman, 2004).H2DCF-DAis taken up by cells, in which internal cellular esterases cleave off the diacetate functional group, preventing 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein (DCF) from diffusing outside of the cell. Upon oxidation byROS, DCF becomes fluorescent. To minimize any dye uptake difference or light-induced fluorescence increases that can occur with this dye (Murata et al., 2001), all incubation and imaging times and settings were carefully maintained within each experimental comparison. We used spectral separation through confocal microscopy to separate out chlorophyll autofluorescence from DCF fluorescence in guard cells in epidermal leaf peels of the wild type,tt4-2, andeto1(Fig. 6). In all three genotypes, DCF fluorescence was at very low levels in pavement cells, but accumulated in guard cells in both nuclei and the cytosol, with greater fluorescence in the nuclei, mirroring the tissue and subcellular accumulation of flavonols. The levels of DCF fluorescence in the cytosol and nucleus of the wild type,tt4, andeto1were quantified in 90 guard cells and values were normalized relative to the levels in the cytosol ofCol-0(Fig. 6B). In thett4mutant, which does not synthesize flavonols, DCF fluorescence intensity was greater in both the cytosol and the nucleus of guard cells compared with the wild type. Quantification of DCF fluorescence indicated that there is a 2- and 2.5-fold increase intt4-2in the cytosol and nucleus, respectively, compared with wild-type guard cells. A, Confocal micrographs ofH2DCF-DA-stained guard cells of 4-week-oldCol-0,tt4, andeto1plants. DCF fluorescence is shown in green, and chlorophyll autofluorescence is shown in blue in separate channels and merged images captured under identical confocal settings. B, Quantification of subcellular DCF fluorescence in guard cells. Leaf peels of 3- to 4-week-old plants were stained with 2.5 μMH2DCF-DAfor 30 min and imaged using confocal microscopy. DCF intensity values in the cytosol and nucleus of guard cells were determined and are reported relative to the levels in the cytosol ofCol-0. The average ±seof 90 stomata from three biological replicates are reported. C, Quantification of subcellular DCF fluorescence in guard cells. Data from two experiments are combined and the average ±seof 60 stomata are reported. Asterisks indicate significant differences (P< 0.005) between the mutant and the wild type within treatment. Number signs indicate significant differences (P< 0.05) between treated and untreated controls within a genotype as determined by the Student’sttest. Bar = 15 µm. Stomatal Closure Is Modulated by Ethylene Levels Stomatal aperture widths in response toABA.ABAsensitivity is indirectly proportional to relative flavonol concentration. Guard cells were incubated under white light in a 20-μMABAsolution for 0, 45, and 90 min. The average ±seof 90 stomata from three biological replicates are reported. Asterisks indicate significant differences between samples and untreatedCol-0using a Student’sttest (P< 0.05). Guard cells control the aperture of stomatal pores in response to environmental fluctuations, including variations in light intensity, moisture, and carbon dioxide levels (Hetherington and Woodward, 2003). In response to environmental stress, the plant hormoneABAsignals stomatal closure (Zeevaart, 1980;Hirayama and Shinozaki, 2007;Cho et al., 2009;Joshi-Saha et al., 2011). This signaling pathway employsH2O2as aROSsecond messenger (McAinsh et al., 1996;Murata et al., 2001;Zhang et al., 2001;Kwak et al., 2003). During signaling of stomatal closure,ROSmust reach a certain threshold to oxidize their targets (Kwak et al., 2003;Cho et al., 2009), but must not reach levels that will cause oxidative damage (Munné-Bosch et al., 2013). To prevent oxidative damage,ROSsignaling must be tightly regulated by small molecule and/or protein antioxidants (Conklin et al., 1996;Apel and Hirt, 2004), with antioxidants including glutathione and flavonoids. Recent reports demonstrated the altered redox state and altered stomatal aperture in mutants defective in glutathione synthesis (Okuma et al., 2011;Munemasa et al., 2013). In this study, we tested the hypothesis that flavonols act as antioxidants that reduceROSconcentrations in guard cells, thus modulating stomatal closure. Because flavonols accumulate specifically in guard cells, we asked whether these molecules function as antioxidants to reduceROSconcentrations. Flavonols have been shown to have antioxidant activity in vitro; however, their antioxidant activity in planta has been debated (Rice-Evans et al., 1997;Hernández et al., 2009;Pollastri and Tattini, 2011). BecauseROShas been implicated as a second messenger in guard cell signaling (McAinsh et al., 1996;Murata et al., 2001;Zhang et al., 2001;Kwak et al., 2003), we asked whether the presence of flavonols affected theROSaccumulation in guard cells. To visualizeROSaccumulation, we usedDCFH-DA, a generalROSsensor, and utilized spectral separation to remove chlorophyll autofluorescence. DCF fluorescence was localized to guard cells, similar to theDPBAfluorescence pattern, indicating that both flavonols andROSaccumulate specifically in this cell type, but not in surrounding pavement cells. In addition, we saw increased DCF fluorescence intt4-2mutants that synthesize no flavonols, consistent with the absence of flavonols resulting in increasedROSconcentrations, which is also consistent with an antioxidant activity for flavonols in vitro. DPBAfluorescence were at higher levels in the nuclei than the cytosol in all genotypes and treatments. This observation is consistent with characteristics of other plant species that showed flavonoid andROSaccumulation in the nuclei (Feucht et al., 2004;Mazars et al., 2010;Lewis et al., 2011). Immunolocalization with antibodies againstCHSand chalcone isomerase suggests that the enzymes of flavonoid synthesis are localized to the nucleus in Arabidopsis roots (Saslowsky et al., 2005). The nuclear localization of flavonols is consistent with the notion thatROScan regulate gene expression through interaction with redox-sensitive transcription factors (TFs) in plants (Wu et al., 2012), such as the well-established redox-sensitiveTFdescribed in bacteria and mammals (Aslund et al., 1999;Biswas et al., 2006). Flavonols are a likely candidate to modulate the activity of redox-sensitiveTFs, because of their increased accumulation in the nuclei; however, it is unlikely that they are the only antioxidant present in this organelle. Flavonols have been shown to chelate metal ions, such as Fe3+, which catalyze the production of hydroxyl radicals fromH2O2(Hernández et al., 2009). Thus, flavonol accumulation in the nucleus would contribute to a decreased redox potential in the nucleus, potentially decreasing the number ofTFoxidation events. Combined with our data suggesting an in planta antioxidant ability of flavonols, we hypothesize that flavonol accumulation in the nuclei may modulate the activity of redox-sensitiveTFs that affect gene expression in addition to preventing oxidative damage to DNA, although the time scale of transcriptional effects may be beyond the rapid regulation of guard cell aperture. Because stomatal apertures are environmentally regulated, we hypothesized that regulation of flavonol synthesis may be a way for plants to modulate the physiology of guard cells. Previous studies have shown that ethylene increases flavonol accumulation in Arabidopsis roots (Buer et al., 2007;Lewis et al., 2011), and we asked whether this hormone may also increase flavonol accumulation in guard cells. Elevated levels of ethylene through endogenous overproduction in theeto1mutant and exogenous application of ethylene to wild-type leaves increased flavonol accumulation in this cell type, as visualized by localizedDPBAfluorescence. We observed robust increases inDPBAfluorescence at both 3 and 24 h after treatment with ethylene gas. This ethylene-enhanced flavonol accumulation pattern requires a functional ethylene signaling pathway, because the ethylene-inducedDPBAfluorescence increases were lost in theein2mutant. A previous study showed that ethylene-induced flavonoid increases detected byDPBAcan also be detected byLC-MS(Lewis et al., 2011). We therefore verified these flavonols increases in leaves usingLC-MSand detected approximately 5-fold increases in quercetin and a smaller, but still statistically significant, increase in kaempferol in whole leaves treated with ethylene under similar conditions. We also observed decreased DCF fluorescence in the wild type andtt4treated with ethylene for 3 or 24 h as well as ineto1guard cells compared with the wild type, suggesting that the increase in flavonols decreasesROSconcentrations. In addition, ethylene-treated wild-type guard cells andeto1exhibited a decreased rate ofABA-induced stomatal closure, a result that is consistent with flavonols acting as antioxidants reducing theH2O2burst that drives stomatal closure. A proposed model of the effects of ethylene and flavonols on stomatal closure.ABAis released into the cytosol where it triggers respiratory burst oxidases, which induce a burst ofROS, which act as secondary messengers to signal stomatal closure. Ethylene induces flavonols accumulation in guard cells through EIN2. Flavonols act as antioxidants to scavengeROSand thereby inhibits stomatal closure. In the absence of flavonols, ethylene inducedROSaccumulation after 24 h, but not after 3 h of treatment. Similarly, 24 h of ethylene treatment affected stomatal aperture intt4, whereas 3 h of ethylene treatment did not. The effects of ethylene observed at 24 h are indicated with dashed lines. Arrows represent positive effects and bars represent negative effects. Plant Growth and Ethylene Treatment Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants were germinated on 1× Murashige and Skoog medium, pH 5.6, Murashige and Skoog vitamins, and 0.8% (w/v) agar, buffered with 0.05% (w/v) MES and supplemented with 1% (w/v) Suc. After vernalization at 4°C for 48 h, plates were placed in a 12-h day growth chamber under 100µmol m−2s−2cool-white light. Seedlings were transferred to Metromix 360 soil 7 d after germination. All experiments were conducted on leaves of plants that were 3 to 4 weeks after germination. This study utilized ecotype Columbia 0 of Arabidopsis (Col-0),tt4-2(Lewis et al., 2011),eto1(Chae et al., 2013),ein2-5(Alonso et al., 1999), and aCHS:GUSreporter (Chory and Peto, 1990). For ethylene treatments, 4-week-old wild-type,tt4-2, andein2-5plants were placed in a clear plastic container that was sealed with vacuum grease. Ethylene gas was added to achieve a 5 μL/L concentration of ethylene within the chamber. Control plants were placed in identical sealed containers without ethylene. After either 3 h or 24 h of incubation, leaves were excised and used for imagingDPBAor DCF fluorescence, or in stomatal closure assays. Flavonol Accumulation UsingDPBA Individual leaves were excised and submerged in an aqueous solution containing 0.01% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 2.52 mg/mL−1DPBAfor 2.5 h. Whole leaves were then washed in deionized water for 1 min and mounted in deionized water between two coverslips. A Zeiss 710LSCMwas used to excite the leaf surfaces with 100% maximum laser power at 488 nm and a pinhole yielding a 4-μm cross section. We optimizedLSCMsettings to spectrally separate the fluorescence of flavonol-DPBAand chlorophyll by capturing the emission spectrum for each compound in which there is no overlap.DPBAfluorescence emission was collected between 475 and 619 nm (Lewis et al., 2011). The gain settings were selected to maximize the total flavonol signal while preventing oversaturation. All micrographs within each figure were acquired using identical offset, gain, and pinhole settings using the same detectors. Postimage quantification ofDPBAfluorescence intensities was done by placing a region of interest (ROI) around the nuclei of each guard cell and around an area in the cytosol with no chloroplasts present. The average intensity values within eachROIwere recorded and averaged. Histochemical Staining and Imaging ofCHS:GUSActivity Whole leaves from theCHS:GUStransgenic line were excised and submerged in a GUS staining solution (80 mmsodium phosphate buffer, 0.4 mmpotassium ferricyanide, 0.04 mmpotassium ferrocyanide, 0.05% [v/v] Triton X-100, 0.8 mg/mL 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-glucuronide, pH 7) at 37°C for 18 h. Leaves were removed from staining solution and washed with 75% (v/v) ethanol for 5 min. Epidermal strips were prepared by spraying a microscope slide with a silicone-based medical adhesive (Hollister stock #7730). After 5 min, the basal epidermis of the leaf was gently pressed into the dried adhesive coat, and the leaf was gently scraped with a pipette tip until only the fixed epidermis remained (Young et al., 2006). Epidermal peels were imaged usingDICimaging with a Zeiss Auxio Observer D1 microscope with an AxioCam HRc color camera. Quantification of Flavonols byLC-MS Samples were run on a Thermo LTQ Orbitrap XL with an electrospray ionization source, coupled to a Thermo Accela 1250 pump and autosampler (Thermo Fisher), using a Security Guard column in line with a Luna 150 × 3 C18 column, both from Phenomenex. For flavonol analysis, 10 µl of each sample was injected with a solvent of water:acetonitrile, both containing 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in the following gradients: 95% to 40% (v/v) water from 0 to 5 min, 40% to 20% (v/v) water from 5 to 20 min, and 20% to 95% (v/v) water from 20 to 23 min to recondition the column. MS2fragmentation spectra of flavonols were induced using 30-kV collision-induced dissociation. Spectra of samples were compared to those of standards and those listed on the MassBank database (www.massbank.jp). Data were analyzed by quantifying peak areas using Thermo Xcalibur software, and with normalization to the internal standard formononetin (Indofine Chemicals). Absolute quantities of metabolites were found by comparing peak area data to standard curves created using pure standards of quercetin and kaempferol (Indofine Chemicals). DCF and Hoechst Staining and Quantification H2DCF-DAwas dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide to yield a 50-μmstock. This was diluted in deionized water to yield a final concentration of 2.5 µM with 2% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide. The epidermis was stained for 15 min with two drops of H2DCF-DA stain and washed with deionized water. A Zeiss 710LSCMwas used to excite the leaf surfaces with 1% maximum laser power at 488 nm with a 3.5 digital gain. Settings were optimized to spectrally separate the fluorescence of DCF -ROSand chlorophyll by capturing the emission spectrum for each compound in which there is no overlap. The DCF signal was collected between 495 to 527 nm with a pinhole yielding a 4-μm cross section, making sure to limit excess exposure to the laser that inducesROS. The gain settings were selected to maximize the total DCF signal while preventing oversaturation. All micrographs within each figure were acquired using identical offset, gain, and pinhole settings using the same detectors. DCF fluorescence intensities were measured by placing anROIaround the nuclei of each guard cell and around an area in the cytosol with no chloroplasts present. The average intensity values within eachROIwas recorded and averaged. Hoechst imaging was performed on whole leaves that were previously stained withDPBA. After 2.5 h ofDPBAstaining, leaves were washed in deionized water for 1 min and transferred to an aqueous solution containing Hoechst at a 1 µg/mL concentration. The leaf surface was excited with 10% laser power at 405 nm and a pinhole yielding a 4 μm cross section. We optimizedLSCMsettings to spectrally separate the fluorescence of the Hoechst stain with cell wall autofluorescence by capturing the emission spectrum for each compound in which there is no overlap. Hoechst fluorescence emission was collected between 420 to 546 nm. The gain settings were selected to maximize the total Hoechst signal while preventing oversaturation. ABA-induced stomatal closure assays were performed with plants 3 to 4 weeks after germination. Leaves from untreated plants or plants treated with ethylene gas for 24 h were excised and submerged in an aqueous opening solution (5 mM KCl, 50 µM CaCl2, 10 mM MES buffer, pH 5.6) and incubated under cool-white light for 3 h. To induce stomatal closure, leaves were transferred to a similar opening solution with 20 µMABAadded to induce closure (Jammes et al., 2009). After incubation in theABAsolution under white light (100 µmol m−2s−2) for 0, 45, 90, and 180 min, leaf peels were prepared and imaged usingDICimaging with a Zeiss Axio Observer D1 microscope with a Hamamatsu 1394 ORCA-ERA monochromatic camera (Jammes et al., 2009). Apertures were measured using ImageJ software. Sequence data from this article can be found in the GenBank/EMBL data libraries under accession numbers.
