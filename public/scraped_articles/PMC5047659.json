KEY WORDS:Arabidopsis thaliana, Cytokinin, Plastid, Reactive oxygen species, Retrograde signaling, Shoot apical meristem Summary:During plastid stress-induced apical callus production inArabidopsis, the cytokinin/WUSCHEL pathway and a plastid-to-nucleus signaling pathway are implicated in cell differentiation at the shoot apex. The development of land plants provides a unique opportunity to study how cell differentiation is determined, as plant cell identity is highly plastic (Gaillochet and Lohmann, 2015). A classic illustration of plant cell pluripotency is the ability to produce a mass of undifferentiated cells referred to as callus. In nature, callus production is triggered by wounding or exposure to pathogens (Ikeuchi et al., 2013). In the laboratory, callus is typically induced by exogenous treatment with two phytohormones, cytokinin (CK) and auxin (Skoog and Miller, 1957). Callus is frequently derived from meristem or meristem-like cells (Jiang et al., 2015;Sugimoto et al., 2011). Meristems are small self-renewing pools of undifferentiated cells from which new organs are derived as the plant grows (Aichinger et al., 2012;Gaillochet and Lohmann, 2015). Above ground, the maintenance and regulation of the shoot apical meristem (SAM) is crucial for the proper specification and positioning of leaves (Barton, 2010). SAM identity requires both the imposition of stem cell fate by the WUSCHEL (WUS)/CLAVATA (CLV) signaling circuit (Fletcher et al., 1999;Schoof et al., 2000) and the suppression of differentiation by SHOOTMERISTEMLESS (STM) (Endrizzi et al., 1996;Long et al., 1996). CK plays a key role in the function of the SAM. In the central zone (CZ), CK promotes proliferation, while auxin promotes differentiation in the peripheral zone (PZ) (Schaller et al., 2015). Localized CK perception and response specifies the organizing center of the SAM, also the region ofWUSexpression (Chickarmane et al., 2012;Gordon et al., 2009;Zurcher et al., 2013). WUS activity maintains itself through a positive feedback loop involving the CK response via type-AArabidopsisresponse regulators (ARRs), key negative regulators of CK signaling (Leibfried et al., 2005;Schuster et al., 2014;To et al., 2007;Zhao et al., 2010). In the SAM, auxin acts to repressARR7andARR15, (Zhao et al., 2010). Thus, auxin and CK synergize to regulate the core WUS/CLV pathway, maintaining a balance between differentiation and proliferation in the SAM (Gaillochet and Lohmann, 2015;Ikeuchi et al., 2013). Shoot development also depends on plastids, which are endosymbiotic organelles responsible for photosynthesis, amino acid, starch and fatty acid biosynthesis, and the production of many hormones and secondary metabolites (Neuhaus and Emes, 2000). As cells leave the SAM and take on the appropriate cell identity within leaf primordia, the small, undifferentiated plastids – called proplastids – inside them must also differentiate, usually into chloroplasts. Many mutants lacking functional plastid-localized proteins exhibit secondary defects in leaf cell specification (Larkin, 2014;Luesse et al., 2015;Moschopoulos et al., 2012), providing genetic evidence that normal leaf development depends upon plastid homeostasis. The integration of plastid differentiation into the process of development probably requires tightly regulated and finely tuned two-way communication between the plastid and the nucleus, including both anterograde (nucleus-to-plastid) and retrograde (plastid-to-nucleus) signaling. An increasing number of overlapping retrograde signaling pathways that are triggered by developmental or environmental defects in plastid function have been identified (Chan et al., 2016;Woodson and Chory, 2012). Numerous retrograde signals have been proposed, including intermediates in isoprenoid (Xiao et al., 2012) biosynthesis, heme (Woodson et al., 2011), phosphonucleotides (Estavillo et al., 2011), reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Wagner et al., 2004) and oxidized carotenoids (Ramel et al., 2012). Despite the diversity, all these pathways and signals link a disruption in plastid homeostasis to altered nuclear gene expression (Chan et al., 2016). One retrograde signaling pathway that may serve to connect plastid signals to shoot development is the GENOMES UNCOUPLED (GUN1)/ABA-INSENSITIVE 4 (ABI4) pathway (Fernandez and Strand, 2008;Leon et al., 2012). ABI4 is a nuclear transcription factor involved in many plant developmental pathways, including the response to ABA, sugar signaling, and mitochondrial retrograde signaling (Leon et al., 2012). GUN1 is a plastid protein of unclear molecular function that is thought to act with ABI4 in at least two retrograde signaling pathways: one that coordinates plastid and nuclear gene expression during development, and one that respond to defects in chlorophyll biosynthesis (Cottage et al., 2010;Koussevitzky et al., 2007;Sun et al., 2011). We have been using anArabidopsismutant with constitutively osmotically stressed plastids [msl2 msl3(Veley et al., 2012)] as a model system to address the developmental effects of plastid dysfunction. MSL2 and MSL3 are two members of the MscS-Like (MSL) family of mechanosensitive ion channels that localize to the plastid envelope and are required for normal plastid size, shape and division site selection (Haswell and Meyerowitz, 2006;Wilson et al., 2011). By analogy to family members in bacteria (Levina et al., 1999) and plants (Hamilton et al., 2015) and based onin vivoexperiments (Veley et al., 2012), MSL2 and MSL3 are likely to serve as osmotic ‘safety valves’, allowing plastids to continuously maintain osmotic homeostasis during normal growth and development. In addition,msl2 msl3mutant plants exhibit small stature, variegated leaf color and ruffled leaf margins. These whole-plant defects can be attributed to plastid osmotic stress, as they are suppressed by environmental and genetic manipulations that increase cytoplasmic osmolarity and draw water out of the plastid (Veley et al., 2012;Wilson et al., 2014). Here, we report a new and unexpected phenotype associated withmsl2 msl3mutants, and establish the molecular and genetic pathways that underlie it. msl2 msl3double mutants develop callus at the shoot apex When grown on solid medium for over 14 days,msl2 msl3double mutant plants developed a proliferating mass of undifferentiated cells, or callus, at the apex of the plant (Fig. 1A-D). A single mass at the center of the apex, twin masses associated with the cotyledon petioles or, occasionally, three masses were observed (Fig. 1A-C). New green tissue was frequently observed growing out of the apical callus (white arrow,Fig. 1D). This phenotype was not observed in soil-grown plants. msl2 msl3double mutants develop callus at the shoot apex.(A-D) Bright-field images of 21-day-oldmsl2 msl3seedlings grown on solid medium. Shooty callus is indicated with a white arrowhead in D. (E) Time course of callus formation. (F) Mean percentage ofmsl2 msl3seedlings with visible callus at the indicated time after germination.

(H) Mean percentage ofmsl2 msl3seedlings showing visible callus at 21 DAG after transfer from MS to MS (black bars) or from MS to MS with 82 mM NaCl (gray bars) at the indicated time points.

(I-L) Close-up images of individual seedlings shown in (G) grown without NaCl (I) or transferred to NaCl plates at 2 (J), 5 (K), or 7 (L) DAG. (M) Bright-field images of 14-day-oldmsl2 msl3seedlings harboring theMSL2transgene (MSL2g) orMSL2under the control of theSCRpromoter. Scale bars: 1 mm (A-E), 5 mm (G,M) and 2.5 mm (I-L). Masses of callus tissue were apparent to the naked eye at the apex ofmsl2 msl3seedlings between 14 and 16 days after germination (DAG) and continued to grow in size to 22 DAG (Fig. 1E, second row from top). As previously documented (Haswell and Meyerowitz, 2006;Jensen and Haswell, 2012;Wilson et al., 2014),msl2 msl3leaves were small and malformed. To facilitate comparison, the same leaf from each genotype is marked with an asterisk in the time course inFig. 1E. The percentage ofmsl2 msl3seedlings with callus increased to ∼82% by 21 DAG (Fig. 1F); callus was not observed in any wild-type plants at any developmental stage. We previously showed that growth on medium containing increased levels of osmolytes (sugars or salt) suppressed the plastid morphology and leaf development phenotypes ofmsl2 msl3mutants, probably by increasing cytoplasmic osmolarity and reducing plastid hypo-osmotic stress (Veley et al., 2012;Wilson et al., 2014). To determine if the same was true for callus formation, and to assess the dependence of suppression on age and developmental stage, seedlings were germinated on MS solid medium and transferred to medium containing 82 mM NaCl at 2, 5, 7, or 9 DAG and assessed at 21 DAG for callus formation and leaf development. Full suppression of callus formation and abnormal leaf development was only observed in seedlings transferred to solid medium containing NaCl from MS at 2 DAG (Fig. 1G-L), establishing a small developmental window after which alleviation of plastid hypo-osmotic stress can no longer suppress leaf morphology defects and apical callus production inmsl2 msl3mutants. Suppression was also observed when seedlings were grown on medium containing sucrose, sorbitol or mannitol, indicating that the effect is osmotic (Fig. S1A). The converse experiment, in which seedlings were transferred from salt-containing medium to normal MS showed that plastid osmotic homoeostasis is continuously required to maintain normal leaf development (Fig. 1G,H andFig. S1B). MSL2 function is required in the SAM or leaf primordia to prevent callus production Cells and plastids at the apex of youngmsl2 msl3mutants are morphologically abnormal Closer examination of the apex of young (4-day-old)msl2 msl3mutant seedlings revealed a cluster of disorganized and heterologously shaped cells at the expected location of the SAM (Fig. 2A). Most cells within the cluster contained large, spherical, clear entities. In comparison, the SAM cells of a wild-type seedling were organized into cell layers and had small vacuoles. We next used transmission electron microscopy to further characterize the morphology of developing chloroplasts and proplastids in the SAM and surrounding tissue ofmsl2 msl3mutant seedlings (Fig. 2B). In themsl2 msl3mutant, young chloroplasts were enlarged, lacked the lens shape of wild-type chloroplasts and exhibited a disorganized developing thylakoid network (Fig. 2B,D andFig. S2B). In agreement with previous reports (Charuvi et al., 2012), wild-type proplastids appeared as small structures (0.5-1 µm in diameter) containing rudimentary thylakoid networks of varying developmental stages, plastoglobules and double membranes (Fig. 2E andFig. S2A). However, in the SAM ofmsl2 msl3mutants, entities with these established features had decreased stromal density and were greatly enlarged compared with the wild type (asterisks inFig. 2A andFig. S2B,Fig. 2F). Many exceeded 5 µm in diameter. All were clearly bound by a double membrane (white arrow,Fig. 2G andFig. S2C,D). These data show that the greatly enlarged phenotype of non-green plastids of the leaf epidermis (Haswell and Meyerowitz, 2006;Veley et al., 2012) extends to proplastids of the SAM. Four-day-oldmsl2 msl3mutants exhibit abnormal cellular organization and plastids at the SAM.(A) Phase contrast images of the SAM region of seedlings of the indicated genotypes. (B-G) Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images ofmsl2 msl3mutant SAM (B) and developing chloroplasts (C-D) and proplastids (E-F) in wild-type andmsl2 msl3mutant seedlings. (G) Magnified region ofmsl2 msl3plastid envelope, indicated by box in F. Examples of proplastids and developing chloroplasts are indicated inmsl2 msl3mutant by asterisks and black arrowheads, respectively. Plastoglobules (PG), double membrane (white arrowheads) and thylakoids (double black arrowheads) are indicated. Scale bars: 50 µm (A), 10 µm (B-D), 1 µm (F) and 100 nm (E,G). Callus produced inmsl2 msl3mutants is associated with an altered cytokinin to auxin ratio and requires CK perception The production of shooty callus has been associated with increased production or availability of CKs and an imbalance in the cytokinin:auxin ratio (Frank et al., 2002,2000;Lee et al., 2004). Consistent with these observations, apical callus production, dwarfing and leaf phenotypes of themsl2 msl3double mutant were strongly suppressed when seedlings were grown on medium with the synthetic auxin 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) (Fig. 3A,C). The leaf epidermis ofmsl2 msl3seedlings contain grossly enlarged and round non-green plastids, as visualized with the fluorescent plastid marker RecA-dsRED (Haswell and Meyerowitz, 2006;Veley et al., 2012;Wilson et al., 2014). This phenotype was not altered by growth on 2 µM NAA (Fig. 3B), indicating that NAA treatment suppresses callus formation downstream of effects on plastid morphology. In agreement with previous data, growth on medium supplemented with salt fully suppressed the plastid morphology defects (Veley et al., 2012). Trans-zeatin-riboside levels were increased ∼6.5-fold inmsl2 msl3mutant seedlings compared with the wild type, but IAA levels were not significantly changed (Fig. 3D). Callus produced inmsl2 msl3mutants is associated with increased CK production and requires CK signaling.(A) Seedlings grown for 21 days on solid medium containing the indicated concentration of NAA.

ARABIDOPSIS HISTIDINE KINASE 2(AHK2) encodes one of three related histidine kinases known to function as CK receptors inArabidopsis(Ueguchi et al., 2001;Yamada et al., 2001) and anAHK2loss-of-function mutant,ahk2-2(Higuchi et al., 2004) is impaired in CK-induced upregulation ofWUS(Gordon et al., 2009). Two independently isolatedmsl2 msl3 ahk2-2triple mutants showed a significant reduction in apical callus formation, with less than 40% of seedlings developing callus (Fig. 3F). However, themsl2 msl3 ahk2-2triple mutants were similar to themsl2 msl3double with respect to the leaf developmental defect (Fig. 3E). Incomplete suppression may be due to redundancy among CK receptors (Gordon et al., 2009), or callus formation and leaf morphology defects may be produced through different pathways. To determine if feedback loops involvingWUS, ARR genes (Gordon et al., 2009;Schuster et al., 2014), or the meristem identity geneSTM(Scofield et al., 2013) were misregulated inmsl2 msl3seedlings, quantitative RT-PCR was used to determine transcript levels in the aerial tissue of 7- and 21-day-old seedlings (Fig. 3G). Inmsl2 msl3mutant seedlingsWUStranscript levels were upregulated 5.3-fold compared with the wild type by 7 DAG (prior to visible callus development,Fig. 1E); and 4-fold by 21 DAG.STMexpression levels were upregulated 2.1-fold in 7-day-oldmsl2 msl3mutants, but were not distinguishable from the wild type at 21 DAG. Consistent with previous observations that they inhibit callus formation (Buechel et al., 2010;Liu et al., 2016),ARR7andARR15transcript levels were reduced in both 7- and 21-day-oldmsl2 msl3mutant seedlings compared with the wild type, exhibiting 43-55% and 13-44% decreases, respectively. Transcriptional repression is specific toARR7andARR15, as transcript levels of two other A-type ARR genes,ARR4andARR5, were elevated inmsl2 msl3mutant seedlings compared with the wild type. Hypocotyls frommsl2 msl3mutants did not efficiently produce callusin vitro, indicating that an additional signal or signals are required to produce callus outside the SAM in these mutants (Fig. S3A). Furthermore, multiple genes involved in wound-inducible and auxin-inducible callus production show altered expression inmsl2 msl3mutants, includingWIND1,WIND3,KPR2,KPR7,TSD1andTSD2(Anzola et al., 2010;Frank et al., 2002;Iwase et al., 2011;Krupkova and Schmulling, 2009) (Fig. S3B). In plastids, the photoreduction of molecular O2generates O2−, which is then rapidly converted into H2O2by plastid-localized superoxide dismutase enzymes (Asada, 2006). To determine if plastid osmotic stress and the accumulation of O2−at the apex ofmsl2 msl3double andmsl2 msl3 p5cs1-4triple mutants play causative roles in callus formation, plants were germinated on or transferred to solid medium with 82 mM NaCl or with TEMPOL (a O2−scavenger) at 3 or 7 DAG and stained with NBT at 21 DAG. Growth on medium containing NaCl suppressed O2−accumulation inmsl2 msl3double andmsl2 msl3 p5cs1-4triple mutant seedlings (Fig. 5A), completely prevented callus formation (Fig. 5B) and suppressed defects in non-green plastid morphology (Fig. 5C) and leaf morphology (Fig. 5A). Thus, plastid osmotic stress is responsible for O2−accumulation as well as callus formation inmsl2 msl3andmsl2 msl3 p5cs1-4mutants. Consistent withFig. 1H, growth on NaCl suppressed callus formation and ROS accumulation only if supplied prior to 7 DAG. Hyper-accumulation of superoxide is required for callus formation inmsl2 msl3andmsl2 msl3 p5cs1seedlings.(A) NBT-stained seedlings provided with TEMPOL or NaCl at 0, 3 or 7 DAG. Scale bars: 1 mm.

(C) Confocal micrographs of non-green plastids in the first true leaf ofmsl2 msl3mutants harboring the RecA-dsRED plastid marker grown on the indicated medium. Scale bar: 10 µm. (D) Apical callus production in T2 lines segregating transgenes that overexpressCSD2ormCSD2. The mean of four biological replicates (n≥35 seedlings each replicate) is presented. Error bars indicate s.d. Statistical grouping was performed by ANOVA followed by Tukey's HSD test,P<0.01. (E) Percentage of seedlings from D stained with NBT in three phenotypic categories (n≥20 seedlings). (F) Images ofCSD2overexpression T2 lines. White arrows indicate deformed leaves. Scale bars: 5 mm. Growth on TEMPOL-containing medium successfully prevented the accumulation of O2−in the SAM ofmsl2 msl3andmsl2 msl3 p5cs1-4mutants, regardless of seedling age at time of application (Fig. 5A), but did not affect plastid morphology (Fig. 5C) or leaf morphology defects (Fig. 5A). Treating double and triple mutant seedlings with TEMPOL at all developmental stages partially suppressed callus formation (Fig. 5B). Less than 40% of double mutant seedlings exhibited apical calluses when grown in the presence of TEMPOL, compared with >90% when grown on MS without TEMPOL. TEMPOL-mediated callus suppression is thus independent or downstream of the developmental window in which addition of osmotic support must be provided for complete suppression of aerial phenotypes (Fig. 1H andFig. 5A,B). Callus production requires ABA biosynthesis, ABI4 and GUN1 Callus production requires ABA biosynthesis, GUN1 and ABI4.(A) 21-day-oldmsl2 msl3double andmsl2 msl3 aba2-1triple mutant seedlings.

(G) 21-day-old seedlings of the indicated genotypes stained with DAB or NBT. Scale bars: 1 mm (A,F,G) and 2.5 cm (C-E). One of the most fundamental decisions a cell can make is whether to proliferate or to differentiate. In the plant SAM, this decision must be spatially and temporally controlled, so that cells remain in an undifferentiated, pluripotent state in the central zone of the meristem and then differentiate properly as they are recruited into organs at the PZ. Here, we use themsl2 msl3mutant as a model system to show that, in theArabidopsisSAM, proliferation versus differentiation signals are coordinated not only at the tissue and cellular level, but also at the organellar level. We further applied genetic, molecular, biochemical and pharmacological approaches to identify two non-redundant pathways through which plastid osmotic stress may produce apical callus (illustrated inFig. S6). Plants lacking functional versions of the mechanosensitive ion channel homologs MSL2 and MSL3 robustly produce callus tissue at the apex of the plant when grown on solid medium (Fig. 1). Molecular complementation withMSL2under the control of theSCARECROWpromoter established that MSL2/MSL3 are required only in the L1 layer of the CZ and/or PZ of the SAM to prevent callus formation (Fig. 1M) and that their function is crucial during the first 5 days after germination (Fig. 1G-L). The production of apical callus in themsl2 msl3mutant is associated with dramatically enlarged and developmentally abnormal plastids, specifically in the SAM (Fig. 2,Fig. S2). Developmentally defective plastids were also observed in the SAM of another apical callus-producing mutant,tumorous shoot development 1(tsd1) (Frank et al., 2002). Increased proliferation and the production of callus inmsl2 msl3mutants is associated with a disruption in the CK/WUS feedback loop Several previously identified callus-producing mutants inArabidopsisandHelianthusalso exhibit upregulated CK signaling and defects in meristem identity gene expression, includingtsd1(Frank et al., 2002;Krupkova and Schmulling, 2009), EMB-2 (Chiappetta et al., 2006) and thepasticcinomutants (Faure et al., 1998;Harrar et al., 2003). These data suggest that the CK-induced pathway, the wound-induced pathway and the meristematic identity pathway are interconnected for callus production. Furthermore, themsl2 msl3double mutant is the only callus-producing mutant identified to date with a primary defect in plastid-localized proteins, adding a novel regulatory aspect to these known pathways, and suggesting that plastid osmotic stress is uniquely able to trigger these pathways. While we favor the model shown inFig. S6, other interpretations are possible. Also consistent with these data is a model wherein themsl2 msl3lesions lead to downregulation ofTSD1and/orTSD2, or upregulation of WIND genes, either of which could disrupt the CK/WUS loop. Plastid retrograde signaling is required for increased proliferation and the production of callus We note that only a few of the genetic or pharmacological treatments that suppressed callus formation in themsl2 msl3mutant also suppressed the leaf developmental defects. Growth on exogenous auxin was the only treatment to completely suppress all of the mutant phenotypes, whereas preventing CK signaling, ABA biosynthesis, ROS accumulation or GUN1 or ABI4 function only partially rescued leaf defects (Fig. 3E,Fig. 5F,Fig. 6). It is possible that these differences are due to genetic redundancy or to limited uptake or transport of TEMPOL. Alternatively, there may be two fundamentally different processes that respond to plastid osmotic stress in themsl2 msl3mutant: one that functions in the SAM during early development and one that functions later on in the leaves. In support of the latter proposal, subjecting seedlings to mild hyperosmotic stress has been shown to prevent leaf cell proliferation (Skirycz et al., 2011). msl2 msl3mutants may provide a functional link between the CK/WUS feedback loop and plastid retrograde signaling to control cell differentiation at the plant apex Plants were grown on full-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium (pH 5.7; Caisson Labs) with 0.8% (w/v) agar (Caisson Labs). NaCl, L-Pro (Sigma) and TEMPOL (Sigma) were added before autoclaving. For transfer assays, seed was surface-sterilized, sown on nylon mesh strips overlaid on 1× MS or 1× MS+82 mM NaCl and stratified for 2 days at 4°C before growth and transfer as described. All plants were grown at 23°C under a 16 h light regime of 130-160 µmol m−1s−1. Confocal microscopy of ds-Red-labeled non-green plastids was performed as in (Wilson et al., 2014). Bright-field images were captured with an Olympus DP71 microscope digital camera and processed with DP-BSW software. Apical meristems were ultra-rapidly frozen in a Baltec high-pressure freezer (Bal-Tec HPM010), excluding air with packing buffer (75 mM PIPES, pH 6.8, 50 mM sucrose). Samples were freeze-substituted in 2% osmium tetroxide in acetone at −85°C for 5 days, slowly thawed to 25°C over 16 h and embedded in Spurr’s resin. Sections (1 μm) for phase microscopy were stained for 30 s with 1% Toluidine Blue O in 1% boric acid. Transmission electron microscopy was done on thin sections of tissue fixed for 2 h in 2% glutaraldehyde, post-fixed for 90 min in 2% osmium tetroxide and embedded in Spurr's resin. Sections were stained in uranyl acetate and lead salts. ROS detection and quantification Detection of H2O2using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB, Sigma) was performed as described (Wu et al., 2012) with the following modifications. Whole seedlings were incubated for 2 h in 1 mg/ml DAB prior to vacuum infiltration, incubated in the dark for an additional 12 h, then cleared with an ethanol series. An Amplex Red Hydrogen Peroxide/Peroxidase Assay Kit (Invitrogen) was used to measure H2O2production in seedlings. Forin vitrolocalization of O2−with NitroBlue Tetrazolium chloride (NBT; Sigma), whole seedlings were vacuum-infiltrated with 0.1% (w/v) NBT in a 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8) containing 10 mM NaN3. After incubation for 1 h in the dark at room temperature, seedlings were cleared with an ethanol series. Quantification of formazan levels was performed as described inMyouga et al. (2008). Subcloning and transgenic lines pENTR-MSL2 (Haswell and Meyerowitz, 2006) was used in a Gateway technology (Life Technologies) recombination reaction with pSCR:GW (Michniewicz et al., 2015) to createpSCR:MSL2.
