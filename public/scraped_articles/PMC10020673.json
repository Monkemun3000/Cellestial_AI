  "content": "Microbial isolation and characterization from two flex lines from the urine processor assembly onboard the international space station Corresponding author.sarah.wallace@nasa.gov Received 2022 Oct 28; Revised 2023 Jan 13; Accepted 2023 Feb 16; Collection date 2023 Dec. A clean and reliable source of water is critical for human spaceflight. With increases in the duration of crewed mission onboard the International Space Station (ISS), the practice of manifesting water, implemented during the Shuttle Program, has become insufficient to meet water demands. As a result, the U.S. Water Recovery System (WRS) was launched to the ISS in 2008 with the goal of generating potable water from urine distillate, humidity condensate, and Sabatier product water, as well as the occasional off-loading of ground-supplied water [1]. The WRS consists of the Urine Processor Assembly (UPA) and the Water Processor Assembly (WPA). As the UPA processes urine, some batches may sit stagnant for hours to days before moving through the system. Therefore, a pretreatment solution containing phosphoric acid (H3PO4), and hexavalent chromium (Cr6+), an oxidizing agent, is added to the urine as a stabilizer. This pretreatment solution serves in both microbial control and chemical stability [2]. Upon reacting with the organics in the urine, Cr6+is reduced to Cr3+and due to the phosphoric acid, the overall pH of the treated urine falls to less than two. Treated urine then enters the Distillation Assembly (DA) of the UPA (Fig. 1). Following processing by the DA, two byproducts remain, distillate and urine brine. The urine distillate undergoes additional processing by the WPA before being considered potable, while the brine is left behind. This brine solution contains approximately 13% of the starting water in the urine as well as low-boiling point organics and inorganics. The DA functions under a vacuum to reduce the heat required to reach boiling point. Following distillation, UPA flex line 115 (UPA115) carries water vapor to the purge pump, where condensation occurs prior to collection for further processing by the WPA [4] (Fig. 1). The urine brine is transferred from the DA by UPA flex line 95 (UPA95) into the recycling tank (Fig. 1). The recycling tank accumulates brine, and current technology demonstrations onboard the ISS are achieving further water recovery by processing the brine [5]. Based on the current system, a maximum of 87% of the water from urine is removed and processed for downstream potable needs. Urine Processor Assembly schematic detailing the positions of the two flex line hoses (UPA95 and UPA115) (Fig. S3). Modified from Carteret al, 2011 [3]. Catalytic oxidation, filtration, and the addition of a biocide during WPA processing serve to substantially reduce microbial contamination in the potable water. This water is held to stringent acceptability limits: 50 colony forming units (CFU)/mL for total bacteria and no detectable coliforms per 100 mL [6]. The presence of coliforms is assessed monthly, while total bacteria are evaluated every quarter. There has never been a true positive coliform detected, and apart from the early checkout process, the levels of culturable bacteria are well below the requirement. However, following assessments of the wastewater tank, solenoid valve crevices, and filter mesh for the U.S. and Russian water systems, increased microbial levels have been noted [7]. Future NASA Programs such as Gateway, a lunar outpost allowing greater access to the lunar surface and a staging point for Mars missions, is expected to have a water recovery and recycling system. However, current planning anticipates Gateway will be unoccupied for up to 11 months per year, resulting in a dormant wetted, water system. A means of microbial control is paramount to this future system. NASA has initiated a robust anti-biofouling program in which many teams are investigating a diverse means of biofilm prevention and mitigation, but the organisms to use in these varied investigations are extremely limited. This coupled with a lack of insight beyond returned PWD and WPA wastewater tank samples, drove pursuing of the opportunity to microbially characterize UPA95 and UPA115 flex lines during refurbishment. The work described here aims to characterize the microorganisms found in the returned UPA flex lines and potentially identify the hosing positions as novel areas of interest for biofilm growth studies in the system. The current WRS employs numerous hosing connections with materials and sizes defined by the initial architecture plan. Determining potential microbial impacts regarding the WRS hosing will enable further engineering controls directed toward biofilm prevention. 2.1. Sample collection and fixation The ISS UPA flex lines assessed included the recycled brine line (UPA 95” flex line 96 M 12561- 099 [UPA95]), which was installed in February 2010, and the purge line (UPA 115” flex line 96 M 12561- 100 [UPA115]) installed in May 2015 (Fig. 1). The polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) flex lines transport water vapor and brine beyond the Distillation Assembly (DA) as part of the overall UPA. For refurbishment, these two flex lines were sealed with quick disconnects in October 2019 and remained onboard the ISS until their return to Earth on SpaceX-21 in January 2021. At Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), stagnant water was collected aseptically from both lines, after which the lines were flushed with 250 mL of sterile water. Visual aggregates were present in the stagnant water from UPA115 (Fig. S1). For both lines, 0.5 mL of liquid from the stagnant collection were immediately fixed for downstream environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) using a solution containing 2% glutaraldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and 3% formaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) in sterile phosphate buffer solution (PBS, pH 7.4, ThermoFisher Scientific,Waltham, MA, USA). The fixed solutions were covered in aluminum foil and kept at ambient temperature for 30 min. The fixed samples were then stored at 4 °C. These samples, as well as water samples from both flex lines, stagnant and flush, as well as the sterile flush water, were shipped on wet ice to the JSC Microbiology Laboratory for further analysis. 2.3. Bacterial and fungal isolation and identification Upon arriving at the JSC Microbiology Laboratory, all samples, excluding those for ESEM imaging, were processed and analyzed following the laboratory’s standard operating procedures for bacterial and fungal enumeration and identification. Briefly, the samples were filtered using a Milliflex system with a Reasoner's 2A (R2A) agar cassette and a Sabouraud dextrose with chloramphenicol (SABC) cassette (MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA, USA) for bacterial and fungal enumeration and isolation, respectively. In addition, serial dilutions of samples were plated on R2A and SABC plates (Hardy Diagnostics, Santa Maria, CA, USA). All cassettes and plates were incubated for two to five days at 35 °C for bacteria and five to seven days at 30 °C for fungi. Following incubation, colonies were enumerated, and each distinct morphological colony was subcultured onto fresh media. Following growth, DNA was extracted from pure colonies representing each morphology using the PrepMan® Ultra Sample Preparation Reagent (ThermoFisher) following the manufacture’s protocol. The DNA was prepared for sequencing according to the MicroSEQ® 500 16S rDNA PCR Kit or Fast MicroSEQ® D2 Fungal rDNA PCR Kit (ThermoFisher) and associated sequencing kits, MicroSEQ® 500 16S rDNA Sequencing Kit or MicroSEQ® D2 rDNA Fungal Sequencing Kit. The prepared libraries were sequenced using Sanger sequencing, Applied BioSystems® 3500 Genetic Analyzer (ThermoFisher), and the sequencing peaks were analyzed using MicroSEQ® ID microbial identification v3.1 (ThermoFisher). For fungal identifications, the isolates were also confirmed morphologically and microscopically. Sanger sequencing data has been deposited in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) under accession number PRJEB58840. 2.4. Culture-independent, 16S rRNA nanopore sequencing and analysis To potentially identify non-culturable taxa from samples, established laboratory protocols for culture-independent, targeted nanopore sequencing were used [9]. Using a syringe, samples were passed through a 0.22 μm mixed cellulose esters (MCE) filter on a 13 mm filter holder (MilliporeSigma). The filter was then removed and placed into PCR tubes containing QuickExtract™ DNA Extraction Solution (Lucigen Cooperation, Middleton, WI, USA) for DNA extraction. Following extraction within the miniPCR™ thermal cycler (miniPCR bio™, Cambridge, MA, USA), DNA purifications, quality assessments, and library preparation followed the established method described in Stahl-Rommel et al. 2021 [9]. The multiplexed libraries were loaded into the flow cell (Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), Oxford, UK) version R9.4.1 and sequenced for 12 h using MinKNOW version 21.02.2 on MinION Mk1C (ONT). Data analysis was conducted as previously described [9]. Briefly, basecalling and demultiplexing was completed using GPU-enabled Guppy Basecalling Software 4.3.4 (ONT). Reads of 1350–1650 bp in length were selected using NanoFilt Version 2.6.0 [11] and mapped to the NCBI Reference Sequence Database using Minimap2 version 2.24-r1122 (-ax map-ont) (Li 2018). SAMtools version 1.14, MAPping Quality (MAPQ) threshold of 1 [12] and MarginStats (marginStats.py 0.1) [13] were used for sequencing statistics. Data visualizations were created in R version 4.2.0 using the ggplot package and heatmap [[14],[15],[16],[17]]. Nanopore sequencing data has been deposited in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) under accession number PRJEB58840. To acquire genomic DNA for hybrid full genome sequencing analysis, bacterial isolates were subcultured onto fresh R2A plates and incubated at 35 °C for 24–48 h. A 1 μL loop was used to pick a single colony from each isolate for inoculation into 10 mL of Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) (Hardy Diagnostics). The inoculation was incubated at 35 °C with shaking at 150 revolution per minute (rpm) for ∼17 h. To collect a cell pellet, inoculum of 1 mL was centrifuged at 16,000 relative centrifugal force (rcf) for 2 min at 4 °C (Eppendorf Centrifuge, 5810R, Enfield, CT, USA). The supernatant was discarded, and the cell pellet was rinsed with PBS before resuspending with 40 μL of PBS by vortexing. DNA was extracted using the Circulomics Nanobind CBB Big DNA kit (PacBio, Menlo Park, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s protocol optimized for high molecular weight DNA for Gram-negative bacteria. Extracted DNA was checked for quality and quantity using the QubitTMdsDNA BR assay kit with a Qubit 4 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher), NanodropTM(Nanodrop One, ThermoFisher), and TapeStation Genomic ScreenTape using 4200 TapeStation System reagents (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). 2.6. Illumina and nanopore genomic sequencing Short-read Illumina and long-read nanopore sequencing was performed to generate hybridde-novogenomes. For Illumina sequencing, 100–500 ng of extracted genomic DNA was used for library preparation following the Illumina DNA Prep (M) Tagmentation (24 samples) (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) and Nextera DNA CD 24 Indexes (Illumina) manufacturer’s protocol. Following library purification, the DNA was assessed for quality, quantity, and size (∼500–600 bp) using QubitTM1x dsDNA High Sensitivity Kit (ThermoFisher) and D1000 ScreenTape and reagents (Agilent). Samples were normalized to 4 nM, then pooled and diluted to a final concentration of 10 pM using HT1 buffer (Illumina). PhiX control V3 was prepared at 4 nM and diluted to 20 pM using HT1 buffer (Illumina). The 10 pM pooled library and 20 pM PhiX control v3 (Illumina) were denatured using fresh 0.2 N NaOH for 5 min at room temperature. The 1% PhiX control was added to the pooled DNA libraries. Pooled libraries were heated to 98 °C for 2 min for additional denaturation prior to loading into a MiSeq® Reagent v3 cartridge (600 cycles) (Illumina) and starting the run on the Illumina MiSeq. For nanopore sequencing, the genomic DNA was sequenced using the Rapid Barcoding Kit (SQK-RBK004, ONT) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, up to 12 genomic DNA samples at 400 – 1000 ng were fragmented, barcoded, and pooled before being purified using a 1:1 AMPure XP bead reaction (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN, USA). The library was quantified using QubitTM1X HS Kit (ThermoFisher) then combined with 1 μl of RAP (ONT) and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. The pooled libraries were loaded into a R9.4.1 flow cell (ONT) within the MinION Mk1C running MinKNOW version 21.02.2 (ONT) and sequenced for 72 h. 2.7. Hybrid genome assemblies, annotation, and analysis Illumina short reads were demultiplexed and fastq files generated using MiSeq Reporter Software version 2.6.2.3 (Illumina). Fastq files were filtered to remove sequencing adaptors, reads less than 50 bases in length, and the PhiX sequencing control using BBduk (BBTools version 38.54) [18]. BBduk also trimmed both ends of the fastq and selected reads with a quality score of 25 of higher. Nanopore long reads were basecalled and demultiplexed using the high accuracy configuration of Guppy (version 4.3.4) with a minimum quality score of 7 and minimum barcode score of 40. Sequencing adapters were removed from reads using Porechop version 0.2.4 [19] and the top 80% of reads were subsequently filtered for sequences >2000 bp with Filtlong version 0.2.0 [20]. Illumina and nanopore Hybridde-novogenomes were assembled using Unicycler version 0.4.8 [21]. Genome assemblies were checked for quality and completeness using CheckM version 1.0.18 [22]. The identities of the assemblies were confirmed with average nucleotide identity (ANI) using fastANI version 1.3 against the NCBI complete genome database [23]. Hybridde-novogenomes were annotated for bacterial chromosomes and plasmids using the command line version of the NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline (PGAP) version 6.0 [24]. PGAP was run using normal parameters with quality control analysis enabled. This version of PGAP included GeneMarkS-2 and GeneMark.hmm-2 for enhanced gene prediction using protein profile hidden Markov models (HMMs). AntiSMASH was used for recognition of secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene clusters (GC) from the isolates [25]. A search for plasmids in the isolated genomes was conducted using the PlasmidFinder [26]. Figures and tables were constructed in R [14]. Graphs were rendered using the ggplot2 program and dependencies [16]. 2.9. Environmental scanning electron microscope imaging Approximately 100 μL of fixed sample was loaded onto an Isopore membrane filter (0.8 μm pore size, 13 mm diameter, MilliporeSigma) and gravity filtered to reduce disturbance to any structure present in the sample. The samples were washed twice with 200 μL PBS (ThermoFisher Scientific) then rinsed with 1000 μL of filtered, sterile Milli-Q water. Sample dehydration was performed with serial rinses using freshly prepared ethanol (200 proof, Sigma-Aldrich) in filtered, sterile Milli-Q water. Initial dehydration involved two sequential 30 min rinses with 500 μL of 25% ethanol then 500 μL of 50% ethanol. This process was continued by applying increasing concentrations of ethanol at 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% and 100% for 15 min each. Following dehydration, the filter was removed with the sample side up and flipped onto an aluminum mount flat pin with carbon conductive tab (Electron Microscopy Sciences, EMS, Hatfield, PA, USA). The samples were allowed to dry inside a biosafety cabinet and then placed into the ESEM chamber for additional drying under vacuum. Following drying, the samples were sputter coated with ∼2 nm iridium on a Cressington Sputter Coater 298 HR that uses a Cressington Thickness Controller MTM 20. Imaging was performed with a ThermoFisher Scientific FEI Quanta 250 using the ESEM mode. All images were acquired at 10 kV in back scatter electron mode at a pressure of ∼1.3 Torr. 2.11. Bacterial-fungal interaction Aspergillus flavus, isolated from the ISS in samples returned on Soyuz 51, was used as a model to characterize the bacterial-fungal interactions of the flex line isolates.A. flavus, from a room temperature molecular water stock, was cultured on SABC for five days at 25 °C. To generate an experimental culture, a 1 μL loop was used to transfer spores to fresh SABC, which was then incubated for seven days at 25 °C. Synchronous bacterial isolates were cultured on R2A for 24–48 h at 35 °C. A 1 μL loop was used to pick a single colony from each isolate for inoculation into 10 mL of TSB (Hardy Diagnostics). The inoculation was incubated at 35 °C with shaking at 150 rpm for ∼17 h. Three different types of growth media were assessed by placing three 25 μL drops of the inoculum on R2A, potato dextrose (PDA) (Hardy Diagnostics) or SABC plates in a triangular pattern approximately 2 cm from the edge of the plate. After 24 h of incubation at 25 °C or 35 °C, a plug of 7-day-oldA. flavuswas introduced to the center of the three triangular bacterial drops. Fungal controls without bacteria were prepared in a similar manner. Two growth temperatures were investigated by placing the plates in either an incubator at 25 °C or 35 °C for five days. Following incubation, the growth diameter of the bacteria and the distance between the bacteria and fungi was measured. This was repeated using biological triplicates. The average and standard deviation of the measurements were calculated. Bacterial cultures of the flex line isolates were prepared as described above. Hemolysis activity was performed by placing three, 25 μL drops of liquid inoculum onto TSA containing 5% sheep’s blood (Hardy Diagnostics). The plates were incubated at 35 °C for 48 h and the zone of hemolysis was recorded. 3.1. Identification of microbial isolates from UPA95 and UPA115 flex lines Culture-based identifications from UPA95 and UPA115 flex line hoses isolates via Sanger sequencing. Selected chemical components recovered from UPA95 and UPA115 flex line hoses. 3.2. Culture-independent, 16S nanopore-generated microbial profiles A culture-independent method that is currently being used onboard the ISS for bacterial surface monitoring [9] was applied to the remaining volume of flush water not consumed by other evaluations. Greater diversity was noted using this method compared to the culture-based data (Fig. 2). Paralleling the culture-based data,BurkholderiaandLeifsoniawere present, and UPA115 demonstrated overall greater diversity as compared to UPA95 (Fig. 2). Microbial profile of the predominate genera within the UPA95 and UPA11 flex line hoses generated through culture-independent 16S rRNA nanopore sequencing. Alignments were generated with minimap2 (-ax map-ont). 3.3. Full genome analysis of bacterial isolates from UPA95 and UPA115 Hybrid genome sequencing summary (additional details available inTable S5). Complete plasmids were not observed in any of nine isolates; however, multiple gene clusters associated with plasmids were noted. This corresponds to previous research detailing the loss of plasmids as a result of co-location and evolution among species in theBurkholderia cepaciacomplex [37]. Additionally, this parallels preceding reports assessing otherB. contaminansisolates from the ISS potable water system [38]. Plasmid loss could potentially be a response of these organisms to the environment within the ISS water system where the associated genes do not lend a competitive advantage. Expanded evaluation of the bacterial isolates that could be identified was conducted through pangenomic analysis using the genomes ofP. fungorumandB. contaminans. TheB. contaminanspangenome analysis resulted in 13,598 unique gene clusters across the 78 NCBI reference genomes and the 5 isolates: 3.1, 3.2, 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4 (Fig. 3). Of the unique gene clusters, 3,720 did not have a known function from the NCBI PGAP annotations. There was a high average geometric homogeneity index (GHI) and a functional homogeneity index (FHI) of 0.97. The high GHI of the analysis indicates that the patterns of residues within gene clusters are mostly uniform, and the high FHI in this study indicates that any differences are minimal and likely will not impact the protein products between genomes sharing unique clusters. Chromate and biofilm-related gene functions were searched for across pangenome annotations and marked in orange and yellow, respectively (Fig. 3). Biofilm gene clusters and quorum system sensor gene clusters were observed in all 83 genomes. Multiple chromate resistance and transporter protein gene clusters stood out as features that set the five isolates from this study apart from the NCBI assemblies and from the other previously reported ISS isolates (Fig. 3,Table S1). The presence of these resistance gene clusters is not surprising and provides insight to the organism’s ability to survive the pretreatment solution within the UPA. 3.4. Environmental scanning electron microscopy of UPA95 and UPA115 samples Upon magnification, present fungal hyphae were noted in various morphologies with smooth, twisted, straight, and rough surfaces revealed. Additionally, presence of bacteria on the fungal hyphae was noted at higher magnification (Fig. 4I). Bacteria and fungi interactively growing in the same environment has been investigated intensively and it is established that bacteria can grow both on and within the fungal hyphae [50]. This, along with other variables such as the presence of chemicals and/or bioproducts such as extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) could explain alterations in the hyphae surface [[51],[52],[53]]. While it is unknown which organisms produced it, EPS was noted in among the images (Fig. 4C, F, 4K, 4L). Taken together, this is the first evidence of biofilm formation within flex lines from the UPA onboard the ISS. 3.5. Biofilm potential of bacterial UPA95 and UPA115 isolates To empirically evaluate biofilm potential of the flex line bacterial isolates, a traditional crystal violet assay was performed following 24, 48, and 72 h of growth. At the earliest 24-h timepoint, significantly enhanced biofilm formation was noted forB. contaminans3.1, 3.2, and 4.2, as compared to the reference control (Fig. 5). Interestingly, this was not seen at 48 h, which could be attributed to weak cell to cell adhesion or cell communication and a longer required time for quorum sensing to regulate EPS production and stabilize biofilm structure [54]. As expected, at 72 h, more mature biofilms were present for all the isolates including the reference control. However,B. contaminans3.1 and 4.2 displayed significantly higher biofilm production as compared to the reference (Fig. 5). While it was not surprising to see biofilm formation fromBurkholderia[55,56], the production by some of the UPA isolates was notable and depicts the biofilm potential of these organisms. Probing the genomes for secondary metabolites revealed gene clusters associated with pyoverdin inB. contaminans3.1 and 4.2, but not other isolates (Fig. 6). Pyoverdin production directly correlates with biofilm formation, as has been documented regarding the pathogenicity ofPseudomonas aeruginosa[57,58]. With regard toBurkholderia,pyoverdine production has been associated with biofilm formation and pathogenicity inB. thailandensis[59]. However, the association of pyoverdin is unknown in the majority of this genera. Furthermore, the genomic data also reveal gene clusters associated with secondary metabolites involved in quorum sensing activity for all theB. contaminansandP. fungorumisolates,but not for theL. licheniaor unidentified Gram-positive bacterium (Fig. 6). The iron-binding or antifungal functional group such as occidiofungin, pyrrolnitrin, pyochelin and ornibactin are regulated by quorum sensing activity [60,61], which is major regulator of biofilm formation. Also, iron-signaling mechanisms contribute to biofilm development, which have been previously investigated withP. aeruginosabiofilms [62]. The crystal violet assay demonstrates the biofilm potential of these isolates, which corresponds with the presence of secondary metabolite gene clusters associated with biofilm production. 3.6. Characterization of bacterial-fungal interactions and hemolytic activity Assessing phenotypic traits from monocultures benefits microbial characterization. However, the importance of investigating interactions between organisms can provide greater insight toward community dynamics and is essential to our understanding of an environment’s microbiome. Bacterial-fungal interactions can result in molecular alterations that have the potential to influence pathogenicity, biofilm formation, or morphology of the microorganisms [63]. Likely as a result of predation within their environment,B. contaminansgenerates protective antifungal compounds that were noted within the genomes [61,64]. Of interest were biosynthetic gene clusters associated with the secondary metabolites occidiofungin and pyrrolnitrin, which were observed inB. contaminans3.2 and 4.3 genomes. Organisms within theBurkholderia cepaciacomplex (BCC) synthesize the antifungal occidiofungin through a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase mechanism [65,66]. Pyrrolnitrin, also an antifungal, is a product of quorum sensing [60]. Occidiofungin and pyrrolnitrin have shown antifungal activity againstAspergillus flavus[67,68]. Additionally, both antifungal compounds have also been tightly associated to hemolytic activity [38,61]. Therefore, the impact of potential secondary metabolite production from all the UPA isolates onA. flavuswas evaluated using three types of media under two temperatures. Hemolytic potential was also assessed. At 25 °C incubation,B. contaminansisolates 3.2, 4.3, 4.5 from both UPA flex lines generated the highest zone of inhibition onA. flavusas compared to the other isolates, including the reference controlB. cepacia(Fig. 7A). OtherB. contaminans3.1, and 4.2,P. fungorum3.3 and 4.1, andB. cepaciadid express the capability of inhibiting the growth ofA. flavusbut at a much lower intensity (Fig. 7A). This was enhanced by culture on PDA (Fig. 7A and 7B). Not unexpectedly, the growth media impacted the antagonistic effect onA. flavus, as was observed for R2A, whileB. contaminans3.1, and 4.2 andP. fungorum3.3 and 4.1 did not strongly inhibitA. flavusgrowth (Fig. 7A). Regarding SABC, a zone of inhibition was not noted for any of the isolates, likely resulting from the interfering chloramphenicol. However,P. fungorum3.3 and 4.1 showed very weak antagonistic effect, as fungal growth was observed. A more optimal growth temperature for bacteria, 35 °C incubation was also investigated. Generally, there was no difference in the trend of antagonistic growth towardA. flavusas compared to 25 °C incubation. The growth diameter ofA. falvusdid not change between the temperatures for R2A and PDA media, but more growth was noted on SABC at 35 °C (Fig. 7A.).B. contaminans3.2 and 4.3 expressed the highest antifungal capability at both temperatures and on all media assessed. The antagonistic distance was reduced at 35 °C on PDA media forB. contaminans3.2, 4.3 and 4.5., which indicated the reduction of antifungal activity. Although there was no change in fungal growth,B. contaminans4.5 showed much lower antagonistic distance on R2A at 35 °C. The unidentified Gram-positive 4.4 andL. lichenia5.2. did not express observable antifungal activity towardA. flavuson any of the tested media at either temperature (Fig. 7A). The association ofL. licheniawith fungi is not well established.L. xylihas exhibited plant growth promoting and low level antifungal properties against certain plant pathogens [69]. In this investigation antifungal behavior was not noted withL. lichenia, nor were known gene clusters associated with fungal inhibition present. Pyochelin biosynthesis cluster was observed in theB. contaminans3.1, 3.2, 4.2, 4.3, and 4.5 genomes and ornibactin gene cluster found inB. contaminans3.1, 4.2, 4.3, and 4.5 andP. fungorum3.3 and 4.1 (Fig. 6). These secondary metabolites are siderophores [70]. Although pyochelin and ornibactin are not well-known as antifungal agents secreted byParaburkholderiaandBurkholderia, they have shown their antifungal and antimicrobial activity under iron deficiency [[71],[72],[73]]. Hemolytic activity was noted forB. contaminans4.5, which demonstrated α-hemolysis activity, whileB. contaminans3.2 and 4.3. expressed strong β-hemolysis (Table S4andFig. S2). All other isolates displayed γ-hemolysis (no hemolytic activity) following 48 h of incubation (Table S4andFig. S2).
