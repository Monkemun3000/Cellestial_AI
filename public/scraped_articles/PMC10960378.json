The International Space Station (ISS) stands as a testament to human achievement in space exploration. Despite its highly controlled environment, characterised by microgravity, increased CO2levels, and elevated solar radiation, microorganisms occupy a unique niche. These microbial inhabitants play a significant role in influencing the health and well-being of astronauts on board. One microorganism of particular interest in our study isEnterobacter bugandensis, primarily found in clinical specimens including the human gastrointestinal tract, and also reported to possess pathogenic traits, leading to a plethora of infections. Distinct from their Earth counterparts, ISSE. bugandensisstrains have exhibited resistance mechanisms that categorise them within the ESKAPE pathogen group, a collection of pathogens recognised for their formidable resistance to antimicrobial treatments. During the 2-year Microbial Tracking 1 mission, 13 strains of multidrug-resistantE. bugandensiswere isolated from various locations within the ISS. We have carried out a comprehensive study to understand the genomic intricacies of ISS-derivedE. bugandensisin comparison to terrestrial strains, with a keen focus on those associated with clinical infections. We unravel the evolutionary trajectories of pivotal genes, especially those contributing to functional adaptations and potential antimicrobial resistance. A hypothesis central to our study was that the singular nature of the stresses of the space environment, distinct from any on Earth, could be driving these genomic adaptations. Extending our investigation, we meticulously mapped the prevalence and distribution ofE. bugandensisacross the ISS over time. This temporal analysis provided insights into the persistence, succession, and potential patterns of colonisation ofE. bugandensisin space. Furthermore, by leveraging advanced analytical techniques, including metabolic modelling, we delved into the coexisting microbial communities alongsideE. bugandensisin the ISS across multiple missions and spatial locations. This exploration revealed intricate microbial interactions, offering a window into the microbial ecosystem dynamics within the ISS. Our comprehensive analysis illuminated not only the ways these interactions sculpt microbial diversity but also the factors that might contribute to the potential dominance and succession ofE. bugandensiswithin the ISS environment. The implications of these findings are twofold. Firstly, they shed light on microbial behaviour, adaptation, and evolution in extreme, isolated environments. Secondly, they underscore the need for robust preventive measures, ensuring the health and safety of astronauts by mitigating risks associated with potential pathogenic threats. Microorganisms within built environments profoundly affect the health of inhabitants. The International Space Station (ISS), a highly controlled built environment harbouring extreme conditions such as microgravity, solar radiation, and elevated CO2levels, offers a unique place for studying microbial survival and adaptation [1]. Recent studies have demonstrated that microorganisms exposed to microgravity can acquire antibiotic resistance and heightened virulence via rapid mutations and horizontal gene transfer [2–4]. Prolonged space travel under microgravity can also compromise astronauts’ immune systems, elevating their vulnerability to diseases [5]. The microbial population of the ISS might potentially impact astronauts’ microbiomes and get replenished by the arrival of new crew [6]. Thus, understanding microbial colonisation, succession, and interactions is pivotal for ensuring astronaut well-being and managing microbial risks in isolated and confined human habitats. Persistent efforts have been made to monitor the ISS microbiome through multiple microbial tracking missions [3,7], identifying novel microorganisms [8–11], studying antibiotic resistance [12] to unveiling microbial interactions [13]. Enterobacter bugandensis, a newly recognised species, emerges as one of the important opportunistic pathogens within theEnterobactergenus and has been isolated predominantly from clinical specimens [14,15]. Species from this Gram-negative, facultative anaerobic genus exist in various environments, from soil to the human gut [16]. In addition, someEnterobacterspecies act as opportunistic human pathogens, causing nosocomial infections with bacteremia, lower respiratory tract, osteomyelitis, sepsis, and urinary tract infection [17]. Moreover, with time,Enterobacterisolates have been shown to manifest multidrug resistance (MDR) mechanisms, including extended-spectrumβ-lactamases (ESBLs), carbapenemases, AmpC overexpression, and altered membrane permeability [18], and have been designated as a member of ESKAPE pathogen group, recognised for their antimicrobial resistance prowess. Interestingly, recent studies have reported the isolation of 13 multi-drug resistantE. bugandensisstrains from the ISS during the Microbial Tracking 1 (MT-1) mission [1,19]. Motivated by the presence ofE. bugandensison the ISS, our central aim was to compare ISS-derivedE. bugandensisgenomes with their terrestrial counterparts, with an emphasis on clinical isolates. We trace the evolutionary dynamics of pivotal genes, including those involved in putative functional adaptations and potential antimicrobial resistance mechanisms, possibly driven by the unique stresses of space. Expanding our investigations, we further examined metagenomic reads to map the prevalence ofE. bugandensisacross diverse ISS locations, capturing its temporal dynamics. In addition, we explored the coexisting microbial communities ofE. bugandensisin ISS across multiple flights and locations. Subsequently, the intricate microbial interactions ofE. bugandensiswithin the ISS were unveiled using a combination of robust computational approaches. This comprehensive analysis (Fig.1) not only sheds light on how these interactions influence microbial diversity and contribute to the potential succession ofE. bugandensiswithin the unique ISS habitat but also aids in designing strategic preventive measures against infections caused by pathogens.

The size of the node corresponds to the number of locationsE. bugandensis) E. bugandensispotentially influences metabolic dynamics of coexisting microorganisms In our findings, we observed 645 nonzero MSI interactions ranging from 0.069 to 1.061%. Specifically focusing on the predicted interactions involvingE. bugandensis, we noticed that it can provide significant metabolic benefits to Gram-positive microorganisms (Fig.6A). Notably,Staphylococcus saprophyticusfrom Flight 1, Location 1, received the highest MSI of 1.06% among others, followed closely byStaphylococcus hominis(0.96%) at Flight 3, Location 2, andStaphylococcus epidermidis(0.96%) during Flight 2, Location 3. Additionally, we observed a slight metabolic advantage for organisms from the Erwiniaceae family in their interactions withE. bugandensis. The genusMethylobacteriumreceived an average MSI of 0.11%. Furthermore,E. bugandensisdid not derive significant metabolic benefits (< 0.1%) from any coexisting organisms. This suggests thatE. bugandensispossibly maintains metabolic competitiveness within these communities. Microbial interactions involvingE. bugandensisand other community members.AThe heatmap presents the span of pairwise Metabolic Support Indices (MSI) provided byE. bugandensis(left panel in blue) as well as MSI values received byE. bugandensis(right panel in orange) from the community members. These values are expressed as percentages.BThe network diagrams provide insight into the type of key interactions involvingE. bugandensisand specific coexisting microorganisms: (i)Pantoeaspecies, (ii)Methylobacteriumspecies, (iii)Klebsiellaspecies, and (iv) Gram-positive species. The colour and direction of the arrowheads on the edges signify the type of observed interaction provided in the legend. The edge labels indicate the Flight–Location where the specific interaction type was observed. For clarity, the nodes representingE. bugandensishave been distinguished E. bugandensisis predicted to affect the growth of coexisting microorganisms Notably,Pantoeaspecies were prominent in interactions withE. bugandensisduring all three flights. WhilePantoeawas mainly present in Location 5 during flights 1 and 2, it appeared in almost all ISS locations during Flight 3.E. bugandensissignificantly reduced growth rates for severalPantoeastrains, includingPantoea agglomerans,Pantoea alhagi,Pantoea dispersa625,Pantoea rwandensis,Pantoeasp. At-9b,Pantoeasp. CCBC3-3-1,Pantoeasp. PSNIH1,Pantoeasp. SO10,Pantoea stewartii, andPantoea vagans, suggesting its parasitic role. However, one exception wasPantoea ananatisPA13, which showed mutualism withE. bugandensis, leading to a significant growth advantage for both microorganisms (Fig.6B). Moreover, in the family Erwiniaceae, microorganisms likeErwinia gerundensis,Mixta calida, andMixta gaviniae, displayed parasitism, whileMixta theicoladisplayed amensalistic interactions, favouring growth advantage forE. bugandensis.Escherichia colialso interacted amensalistically withE. bugandensisat Location 1 during Flight 1, leading to its significant growth reduction. Another group of pathogenic species,Klebsiella pneumoniae,Klebsiella quasipneumoniae,Klebsiellasp. LY, andKlebsiella variicola, coexisted withE. bugandensisduring Flight 1 and 3 in several locations.E. bugandensisexhibited amensalistic interactions withKlebsiellaspecies, leading to a negative growth rate forKlebsiella. Conversely,E. bugandensisdisplayed parasitism towardsK. aerogenes(Fig.6B). E. bugandensisalso displayed positive associations with certain Gram-positive bacteria.Paenibacillus polymyxa, present in Locations 3 and 5 during Flight 2, showed commensalism in the presence ofE. bugandensis, resulting in a growth advantage. Additionally,Staphylococcus epidermidisandStaphylococcus saprophyticusexhibited mutualism, whileStreptococcussp. oral taxon 431 displayed commensalism.E. bugandensisdemonstrated competitive interaction against closely associated species Enterobacteriaceae bacterium S05 and amensalisitic toEnterobacter cloacaewith a negative effect onE. bugandensis. In this study, we discussed the adaptation of a multidrug-resistant, nosocomial BSL-2 pathogen,E. bugandensis, in the unique built environment of the ISS, and its potential succession. Several studies have highlighted the prevalence of microorganisms on ISS surfaces associated with humans, including opportunistic pathogens and discussed the importance of studying them [1,3].E. bugandensis, which is also an opportunistic pathogen, was observed to be present in the ISS during the cataloguing of viable microbial communities [1,19]. Such organisms pose potential threats to astronauts on the ISS, though the exact mechanisms behind their behaviour in space remain unknown. The impact on astronaut health would likely depend on individual health status and how these microorganisms function in extreme space environments. Hence, it is crucial to explore genomic and metabolic studies to understand the functionality of these microorganisms and their potential implications for astronaut well-being. While some attempts have been made to understand the effect of pathogens likeA. pittii[25] andK. pneumoniae[13,26] under stress conditions on the ISS, there is still much more to explore. In this study, we have not limited our analyses to a mere comparison between Earth and ISS isolates ofE. bugandensis. Instead, we adopted a unique threefold approach to unravel the potential succession ofE. bugandensisin the ISS. Firstly, we conducted a comprehensive genome-wide analysis to identify the genomic and functionality changes acquired byE. bugandensisduring its adaptation to the extreme space environment. Secondly, we quantified the abundance ofE. bugandensisin the ISS across multiple flights of the MT-1 mission. Additionally, we looked into the coexisting microbial population ofE. bugandensisthrough a detailed metagenomic analysis. Lastly, we elucidated the metabolic interactions of these organisms and how they contribute to shaping the community structure within the ISS. Through this multi-faceted approach, we were able to explain the survival and dynamics ofE. bugandensisin the ISS environment. Recent studies have also indicated the potential role of increased amino acid biosynthesis in the successful colonisation of stressed environments by bacteria such asSalmonella, which is also from the Enterobacteriaceae family [27]. Another operon, astCADBE, known to be involved in arginine and ornithine transport and metabolism, was present in ISS strains and plays a significant role in virulence in enteric pathogens through arginine catabolism [28]. Furthermore, we identified the gene encoding alanine racemase, a key enzyme transforming L-alanine to D-alanine—an essential step in cell wall biosynthesis. Under stress, this enzyme might play a pivotal role in bacterial adaptation and survival by facilitating D-alanine production for cell wall repair and maintenance [29]. Moreover, the higher prevalence of genes in ISS genomes than their Earth counterparts strongly suggests that ISS strains were able to acquire essential accessory genes through horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events. This hypothesis is further reinforced by the increased abundance of COGs related to mobilome elements (COG3335, COG3600, COG5545). Further, our analysis revealed the presence of genes associated with SOS response systems, including the LexA repressor and ATP-dependent zinc metalloprotease FtsH 4. LexA, notably prevalent in ISS but scarce in Earth strains (< 10%), suggests potential selection pressure onE. bugandensis’s DNA damage response, likely induced by the elevated radiation levels and other adversities experienced aboard the ISS. InE. coliand various bacteria, the LexA protein plays a pivotal role in regulating the SOS response to DNA damage, influencing cellular adaptation to stress [30]. We also noted the existence of toxin-antitoxin systems (TAs), which are widely distributed among bacteria and play a critical role in the evolution and propagation of antibiotic resistance, such as the maintenance of multi-resistant plasmids and the induction of persistence [31]. A subset of genes related to type II toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems, including antitoxin components (HigA, SocA, ParD1) and toxin ParE1, participates in plasmid maintenance [32], stress response [33], and biofilm production [31], thereby enhancing bacterial resilience and virulence. Additionally, the presence of the BvgAS two-component regulatory system, typically observed inBordetellaspecies, is of interest. This system, often referred to as the “master virulence regulator”, controls the activation of virulence genes in variousBordetellaspecies through its components: the histidine kinase BvgS and the response regulator BvgA [34]. Our findings also highlighted the presence of Imm (Colicin-E2 immunity protein), a crucial element providing immunity to colicin E2, which are antimicrobial proteins produced byE. coliunder stress conditions as a defence mechanism [35,36]. Through a comprehensive genome-wide association study, we systematically assessed the identified genes from the pan-genome for their potential links to observed phenotypic traits, considering population stratification. We identified certain genes from our study that are exclusively present in organisms associated with the ISS, but not in their terrestrial counterpart. These include inner membrane protein YbjJ inBacillus cereusfrom the ISS [37], transcriptional repressor LexA, and ATP-dependent zinc metalloprotease FtsH-4 inAcinetobacter pittiifrom the ISS [25], as well as the bvgAS system inCupriavidus metalliduransCH34, known for its resilience in harsh environments and also observed in the ISS [38]. These genes could potentially serve as valuable targets for therapeutics against pathogenic microorganisms in the unique environment of the ISS. This analysis demonstrated a distinct association of the identified genes with ISS isolates, further corroborating their relevance to the specific environmental conditions aboard the ISS. Our analysis found thatE. bugandensiscoexists with a group ofPantoeaspecies at multiple locations across all flights, particularly in the ZSR (Location 5). Although bothEnterobacterandPantoeabelong to the family Enterobacteriaceae, they exhibit high diversity [42] and have been reported to coexist in other environments, including hospital ICUs [43] and sugarcane tissues [44].E. bugandensisalso interacted with severalKlebsiellaspecies within the same family Enterobacteriaceae, mainly at the Cupola (Flight 1) and ARED (Flight 3).E. bugandensisis a common human commensal [45,46] but can act as an opportunistic pathogen, co-infecting immunocompromised individuals (e.g. COVID-infected patients) [47], and have the ability to transfer plasmids through HGT events [48,49]. Studies have also demonstrated the co-presence ofEnterobacter,Klebsiella,Paenibacillus, andPantoeaas bacterial endophytes in cereals andEnterobactersp.,Mixtasp., andPantoeasp. in germinating seeds [50]. To further explore and quantify their interaction patterns, we employed two widely applied computational approaches: (i) graph-theoretical approach to estimate metabolic dependencies and (ii) constraint-based modelling to examine the nature of their interactions. Our study, while informative, does come with certain limitations. In our comprehensive genomic exploration ofE. bugandensis, we uncovered genes linked to the ISS environment. Firstly, the limited number ofE. bugandensisgenomes collected from the ISS, in comparison to Earth isolates, may impact the robustness of our genomic findings. One challenge we encountered was the presence of numerous genes with inadequate annotations, many of which were hypothetical proteins. A comparative study by Lobb et al. [48] reported that Prokka, a widely used annotation tool, demonstrated a mean proteome annotation coverage of 52 ± 9%. However, it is essential to note that Prokka’s functional annotation parameters are stringent, relying solely on reference proteins with experimental evidence for functional assignments. Moreover, while our study strongly suggests adaptation and a “potential” succession ofE. bugandensisin the ISS environment, we acknowledge that true succession assessment would ideally involve techniques such as qPCR or ecological-scale analyses. However, we strengthened our hypothesis for the likelihood of adaptation based on multiple converging analyses employing diverse approaches. Furthermore, the metabolic models we constructed are draft models generated from representative type strains of the organisms. Although we employed default gap-filling options using ModelSEED, these models may still have gaps and could differ from the actual isolates. Despite these limitations, such automated reconstruction models are widely used for studying metabolic characteristics and predicting microbial interactions [51]. Also, our models were simulated under minimal medium conditions along with specific cofactors, thereby representing environmental communities with limited rich medium contents. Although some microbial interactions might remain stable in various nutrient-rich settings, others may vary based on the distinct metabolic capacities of the interacting pairs. While exploring microbial interactions in extreme communities, we employed a graph-based approach for exploring the metabolic dependencies among the members. Our findings suggested that Gram-positive organisms (e.g.Staphylococcus) often rely on metabolic support from Gram-negative counterparts such asEnterobacter,Pantoea, andKlebsiellagenera. Moreover, studies from the ISS surface microbiome of the US module as well as the Japan module have shown that microorganisms belonging to the family Staphylococcaceae and Enterobacteriaceae were the most dominant organisms on ISS surfaces [1,52]. Focusing onE. bugandensis, we observed that it receives limited metabolic support from coexisting microorganisms, suggesting its positioning as a higher-level contributor within the community’s food chain. In contrast, most community members appear to derive some form of metabolic support fromE. bugandensis, albeit nominal in most instances. This finding is consistent with recent research indicating the significance of Enterobacteriaceae in facilitating beneficial interactions among microorganisms, whereas families like Erwiniaceae and Staphylococcaceae contributed less to metabolic support [13]. However, these interactions provide a static snapshot of metabolic interaction potential and do not really capture the nature of interactions. Thus, we introduced a complementary constraint-based method to predict the nature of interactions based on growth rates. This combined approach offers a more comprehensive view of microbial interactions. Our investigation extended to the specific impact ofE. bugandensison other microorganisms. We elucidated possible effects on plant-associated microbes, such asPantoeaandMethylobacterium, suggesting a potential overlap in resource utilisation for growth (Fig.6B). The prevalence ofMethylobacteriumacross the ISS, known for its resilience in challenging environments, underscores its adaptability to extreme conditions from NASA spacecraft assembly clean rooms [53] to hospital intensive care units (ICUs) [54]. Additionally, our study highlighted the reciprocal influence betweenE. bugandensisandKlebsiellaspecies, suggesting a potential reduction in the growth rate forKlebsiella(Fig.6B). A recent study indicated the interaction betweenEnterobacterspecies and clinical isolates ofK. pneumoniaeand their implications for antibiotic resistance patterns [55]. This study also illustrated how the presence ofE. bugandensisinfluences Gram-positive organisms (Fig.6B). Nevertheless, while our metabolic modelling approach predicts antagonistic and parasitic behaviours, further experimentation is required to validate these predictions against other opportunistic microbial pathogens. In this study, we presented a robust and comprehensive methodology to decipher the survival mechanisms of the clinically significant microorganism,E. bugandensis, within the challenging environment of the ISS. Through a synergistic integration of genomics, metagenomics, and metabolic modelling, we unravelled the potential strategies employed byE. bugandensisfor adaptation and persistence in the unique ISS ecosystem. Our approach holds promise for broader applications, especially in terrestrial controlled settings such as hospital ICUs and surgical theatres. Ultimately, our findings pave the way for a deeper understanding of microbial dynamics in extreme environments, laying a solid foundation for future hypotheses and expanding the horizons of microbial ecology research. Collection and classification ofE. bugandensisgenomes In this study, we utilised publicly available annotated genomes ofE. bugandensis(NCBI taxonomic ID 881260) from the NCBI GenBank sequence database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/, accessed on July 17, 2023) using command line tools NCBI Entrez Direct (EDirect) and bit [56]. We downloaded 211 genomes, including 12 genomes of ISS strains and one MAG generated from the metagenome during the Microbial Tracking-1 mission. To identify the source of these isolates, we manually explored the NCBI BioSample database and classified them into four consistent categories—Human, Non-human/ Environmental, ISS, and Unknown isolates. To ensure taxonomic identification and relatedness of the genomes, we employed the FastANI v.1.33 tool to calculate pairwise ANI for each downloaded genome [57]. The reference strain used for ANI calculation was theE. bugandensistype-strain EB-247T(NCBI assembly ID GCF_900324475.1, available athttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample/SAMEA104711314/), which was originally isolated from the neonatal blood of a patient in Tanzania [14]. Phylogeny and SNP identification We used the Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based command-line tool, GToTree v.1.6.31 [58], to construct the phylogenetic tree of theE. bugandensisgenomes. The tree was built at strain level using the single-copy gene (SCG)-set HMM ofGammaproteobacteriatargeting 172 marker genes. We subsequently employed interactive Tree Of Life (iTOL) v.6.7 [59] for visualisation and annotation of the tree. We excluded strain e1342 (NCBI assembly ID GCF_900075565.1) from our further analyses, as it appeared as an outlier in the phylogenetic tree. Identifying ISS-associated genomic features ofE. bugandensis To identify and annotate the ORFs in the genomes ofE. bugandensis, we utilised Prokka v.1.14.6, which employs Prodigal for gene prediction [60]. Prokka’s standard automated pipeline annotated the genomes based on multiple reference databases. We employed the Python package cogclassifier v.1.0.5 (https://pypi.org/project/cogclassifier/) to identify and classify COGs (Clusters of Orthologous Genes) from the Prokka annotated genomes. We applied the graph-based algorithm Panaroo v.1.3.2 in strict mode, employing specific parameters (including a sequence identity threshold of 0.7, a core genome sample threshold of 0.95, no paralog splitting, and the “Clustal” aligner) and constructed a pan-genome [61]. Subsequently, we used IQTREE v.2.2.27 on the Panaroo core alignment output, with the GTR+G model in fast mode, to build an alternative phylogenetic tree [62]. For gene-level genome-wide association analysis, we employed Scoary v.1.6.16, using the gene presence-absence matrix generated by Panaroo [63]. This analysis enabled us to identify associations between all genes in the accessory genome and the traits of interest. To identify the presence of antibiotic resistance genes and markers in the isolated genomes and MAGs ofE. bugandensisfrom the ISS, we employed the Resistance Gene Identifier (RGI) v.6.0.2, a command line tool using the CARD (Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database) v.3.2.6 [22]. Matches were restricted to “Perfect” and “Strict” matches only, ensuring high confidence in the identified antibiotic resistance genes and markers. Presence ofE. bugandensisand co-existing species in ISS metagenomic samples We further employed the CAMP short-read taxonomy pipeline to generate taxonomical classification and relative abundance data for all metagenomic samples with non-human reads. The pipeline uses BBMask within BBMap v.35.85 to mask the metagenomes to prevent false positives in low-complexity or highly conserved regions in bacterial genomes. We then ran Kraken2 v.2.1.2, with a read length cut-off of 150, to classify reads and determine the closest matching species. We used Bracken v.2.7 on the output of Kraken2 to estimate the relative abundance of species in each sample. Reconstruction of genome-scale metabolic models To gain insights into the microbial interactions ofE. bugandensisin the ISS, our primary focus was on identifying the viable microbiome associated with this bacterium. To achieve this, we analysed samples treated exclusively with propidium monoazide (PMA), which retains only viable and intact cells. For our analysis, we specifically considered only those samples containingE. bugandensis. Additionally, we limited our study to bacteria that coexist withE. bugandensis, having a relative abundance of > 1% among all bacteria present at the respective location. We obtained representative genome sequences of the co-existing bacteria from the GenBank sequence database. To construct the Genome-scale metabolic models (GSMMs), these genomes were processed through KBase (https://www.kbase.us/). The bacterial genomes were initially annotated using the RASTtk toolkit v1.073 [64]. Subsequently, the Build Metabolic Model v.2.0.0 app was used to reconstruct the models based on the ModelSEED pipeline [65]. Appropriate templates, such as Gram-positive or Gram-negative, were selected for the reconstruction process. We further gap-filled the models using RefGlucoseMinimal medium from the KBase public media database, with a maximum uptake of Glucose to 10 mmol/gDW-h. These resulting models were then utilised for both graph-theoretic and constraint-based analyses. Exploring the metabolic interactions ofE. bugandensisin ISS We simulated genome-scale models using a comprehensive set of metabolites believed to be necessary for the growth of the microbial community aboard the ISS. This metabolite set combines the minimal medium of each metabolic model with essential cofactors and coenzymes, as reported previously [13]. To determine the minimal media for microbial communities, we employed the minimal_media_from_cobrapy function from MetQuest v.2.0, which ensures the necessary components for a minimum growth rate of 0.1 h-1of all members in the community [66]. We further used MetQuest v.2.0 for constructing bipartite graphs that represent the metabolic framework of microorganisms. These graphs represent the interplay of reactions within the microbial community and helped us identify active and stuck reactions for the given set of metabolites using a guided breadth-first search approach. The extent of metabolic benefit for each pair in the community was measured using the Metabolic Support Index (MSI) according to the following equation: Here,nstuckAandnstuckA|ABare the numbers of stuck reactions in the wild-type and pair-wise community structures. The metabolic dependencies were quantified based on the number of stuck reactions that were relieved by the developed community networks. To predict the nature of microbial interactions, we employed SteadyCom, an optimisation framework for rapid linear programming problem-solving. This framework allowed us to estimate the biomass production rates of every microbial member in the community in a time-averaged, steady-state manner [24]. The pairwise effect of microbes in any given community was expressed through the equation: Here,vbio,Bandvbio,ABare the biomass production rate of the organism B (wild-type) and the community (AB), respectively. For SteadyCom simulation, the same media as before was used, with a constrained uptake rate of −10 mmol/gDW-h. We considered a significant change in growth when there was a 10% difference in the growth rate of an organism within the community compared to its individual growth rate. Based on the calculated values from the equation (i.e. the effect of A on B and the effect of B on A), we classified microbial interactions into six broad types: mutualism (+,+), parasitism (+,−), commensalism (+,0 or 0,+), amensalism (−,0 or 0,−), competition (−,−), and neutral (0,0).
