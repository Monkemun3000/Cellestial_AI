If we assume gravity has remained constant during the species' evolution, will its sensory system adapt to abrupt loss of that force? We address this question in the land snailHelix lucorumexposed to 30 days of near weightlessness aboard the Bion-M1 satellite, and studied geotactic behavior of postflight snails, differential gene expressions in statocyst transcriptome, and electrophysiological responses of mechanoreceptors to applied tilts. Each approach revealed plastic changes in the snail's vestibular system assumed in response to spaceflight. Absence of light during the mission also affected statocyst physiology, as revealed by comparison to dark-conditioned control groups. Readaptation to normal tilt responses occurred at ~20 h following return to Earth. Despite the permanence of gravity, the snail responded in a compensatory manner to its loss and readapted once gravity was restored. Vertebrates and invertebrates sense inertial acceleration and a change in orientation with respect to gravity by mechanoreceptors in the otolith and statolith organs, respectively. The force of gravity is constantly present on Earth and forms the frame of reference for spatial orientation. Inertial accelerations occur within this gravity frame of reference naturally during self-generated movements or those imparted externally onto the organism by perturbations, such as a slippery surface or a deflected leaf. Kreidl (1893) demonstrated in a clever manner that the statocyst is a mechanosensitive organ. As a crayfish molts, it leaves behind the statolith and must manually re-seed its statocyst with a new, typically sand, weight-lending mass. Kreidl replaced the sand with reduced ferrous oxide and manipulated the crayfish's posture using a magnet, thereby simulating the action of the normal gravitational field with a magnetic one. Despite the simplicity of the gastropod organ of balance, there are many functional similarities between the snail's statocyst and the more highly evolved otolith organs of vertebrate species (Popova and Boyle,2015). Statoreceptors, like hair cells in the vertebrate utricle and saccule, are mechanoreceptors that depend on a weight-lending mass to provide a shearing deformation of the underlying ciliary processes to sense position and acceleration with respect to gravity. The mechanoreceptors provide the neural code to the reflex mechanisms that control balance and equilibrium and restore the organism to its appropriate posture and orientation. The first vertebrate ear was in essence a graviceptive statocyst (Budelmann,1988), and only later in evolution did angular acceleration sensation appear as the animal increased its locomotor mobility and developed a flexible neck (Straka et al.,2014). Creating persistent conditions for microgravity The 2013 Bion-M1 space project was a 30-day orbital research mission operated by the Russian Academy of Sciences, launched on 19th of April (2013) from Baikonur Cosmodrome, Kazakhstan, and landed on 19th of May near Orenburg, Russia. The satellite was pressurized and contained full life support systems to maintain safe temperature, oxygen, and carbon dioxide levels for a wide variety of species. The satellite is under Earth's gravitational pull and is in a state of free fall or microgravity (μG), and thus the objects within the satellite appear to be weightless. Upon return to Earth, the snails were airlifted from the landing site by helicopter to the Orenburg airport, flown by airplane to Moscow, and transported by van to the laboratory, arriving within 13 h after landing. Five experimental groups: PF, postflight Bion-M1; OL, overload snails subjected to brief hyper-gravity centrifugation before testing; DK, snails housed in flight habitat in dark like PF snails; ST, starvation snails subjected to the same food and water sources and congestion as PF snails; and NV, naïve snails housed in the standard lab terrarium. Sample number (N=) is given for the total number within each group, and where appropriate the snails are partitioned into either a small body weight or large body weight (parentheses). Pluses correspond to the conditions given in the leftmost column in which the snails in each group are subjected. Gravitaxis reaction to a 90° head down pitch from horizontal was tested in a previously described apparatus (Balaban et al.,2011) following the same protocol, and full course of this stereotypical behavior was recorded for later analysis using a general purpose digital camera at 30 fps. To provide a double blind control analysis the filenames of the PF, ST, and NV groups were encrypted. Three of the authors (M. R., T. K., and A. Z.) independently split video timelines for each snail to fit the gravitaxis phases as described in the previous report (Balaban et al.,2011). The three analyzers then met, reevaluated their tables of latencies, and made screenshots for every phase of each snail's response. A difference in response latencies of >5 s between the 3 datasets was found in about 3% of measures, thereby triggering a discussion of the merits of each measure until the best measure was determined. The other 2 experimental groups, DK and OL, were investigated roughly a year later and a double blind procedure was deemed not pertinent in this case. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analysis was made on statocysts from three groups of snails. The statocysts were extracted after the experimental session, frozen dry and stored at −80°C. Before SEM imaging statocysts were fixed by cold absolute ethanol for 12 h, rinsed in distilled water, and placed onto carbon tape in a drop of water. The statocyst was dissected under a dissecting microscope to visualize the inertial mass using fine neurosurgery forceps. After removal of overlying structures, the statoconia preparations were left for few minutes to desiccate. The prepared samples were then placed on carbon tape for SEM and put horizontally on the stage of the microscope (EVO LS10, Carl Zeiss, Germany) for backscattered electrons (BSE) imaging under low vacuum (50–70 Pa) and accelerating voltage of 22 kV (LaB6 cathode). Digital images were captured in tiff format with resolution 3,024 × 2,406 pixels. Total RNA preparation and cDNA library construction for NGS Statocysts of two groups, PF-e and ST (n= 4 + 4), were frozen −80°C in microRNA buffer for sequencing. Cellular RNA from statocyst samples was prepared by the guanidine thiocyanate method described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (1987). RNA for cDNA synthesis was treated with DNaseI (Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany) for 30 min at 37°C followed by phenol: chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Total RNA samples were analyzed using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer to confirm RNA isolation purity and absence of RNA degradation. The peak of 28S rRNA is invisible in some species of snails because their 28S rRNA consists of two separate pieces held together by ribosome proteins, and after purification each half of 28S rRNA has the same length as 18S rRNA, so 28S peak merges with 18S peak. According to this, we checked only 18S peak integrity to estimate total RNA quality. Reverse transcription of RNA samples was performed using oligo-dT(M1) primer and SuperScript® III Enzyme Mix, and second strand of cDNA was created with Mint cDNA synthesis kit (Evrogen). Then we amplified cDNA samples for 27 cycles in the T100 thermal cycler (Bio-Rad) with universal primer M1. Concentration of amplified cDNA was measured using NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer. cDNA libraries were then prepared using Ion Plus Fragment library Kit (Ion Torrent, Life Technologies) following manufacturer's protocols. cDNA libraries were purified using Magnetic Bead Cleanup Module (Ion Torrent, Life Technologies). The quality of each prepared cDNA library was evaluated using Qubit® 2.0 Fluorometer (with Qubit® dsDNA HS Assay Kit) and Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (with High Sensitivity DNA chip and Agilent High Sensitivity DNA Kit). In our samples, the amount of short cDNA fragments with length of 25–160 bp did not exceed 10%. During the next step, clonal amplification was performed using Ion PI™ Template OT2 200 Kit v3 and Ion OneTouch™ 2 system (Life Technologies) in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations. After amplification, the samples were centrifuged, and precipitates were resuspended in bidistilled water and stored at +4°C for 14–18 h. Sequencing was performed using Ion PI™ Sequencing 200 Kit v3 and Ion PI™ Chip v2 on Ion Proton™ sequencer. One chip contained four libraries tagged with different barcodes. Transcriptome analysis of statocysts First we madede novoassembly ofH. lucorumstatocyst transcriptome using the TRINITY v.2.4.0 (32 G memory, 60 threads, min_contig_length = 200), SPAdes v.3.10.0 (-iontorrent flag, 60 threads) and Velvet/Oases (v.1.2.10, optimal k-mer length was estimated by brute-force method and equal 111, -scaffolding and -read_trkg flags was enabled) programs for assembling transcriptome. For assessment programs quality, we have computed for each program N50 values and maximal transcript length (TRINITY N50—321 Maximal Trans. Len.—2,545 bp; SPAdes N50—558 Maximal Trans. Len.—4,813 bp; Oases N50—453 Maximal Trans. Len.—1,262 bp). Next, all assemblies were merged to one FASTA-file. Transcripts from this file were clustered by homology level. Two transcripts have one cluster, if the homology level is more than 90%. The clustering was accomplished by CD-HIT v.4.6 program. Totally from four different assembles were formed 66355 clusters. After clustering, the longest transcripts were extracted from each cluster and wrote into new multi-FASTA file. 1788966 sequences in final assemble were obtained. For each sequence in this assembly was found open reading frame by Transdecoder. The quality of this combined assembly was estimated by BUSCO v. 2.0.1 program. It computes the percent of correctly assembled orthology genes in the input file. Our combined assembly gave 50% correct orthology genes. For better quality we added an earlier obtainedHelixneural transcriptome assembly. This “multimerged” assembly gave 95.5% correct orthology genes. After the behavioral test was concluded (starting at 14–15 h after landing), the snail was anesthetized by injection of ice-cold isotonic MgCl2solution (~15% of body weight) and its nervous system was isolated and prepared for electrophysiological studies of the statocyst response to tilt mimicking the “head down” and the “tail down” behavioral conditions. The whole nerve recording techniques from the statocyst nerve,n. vestibularis, were made during the time window of 15–26 h after landing. The experimental design and data analysis were conducted in a comparable fashion to our previous Foton-M3 study (Balaban et al.,2011). In brief, the central ganglionic ring was dissected free from the anesthetized animal and pinned to a silicone-elastomer (Sylgard)-coated dish. The vestibular nerve was identified, its surrounding connective tissue was removed, and it was placed across a Vaseline bridge that isolated the nerve in one chamber from the nerve, statocyst, and surrounding pedal ganglion in the other chamber. Each chamber contained a saline solution, a Ag/AgCl wire, and the signals from the vestibular nerve were differentially amplified and recorded. The reflex arc from the statocyst nerve to command neurons of the defensive behavior was tested using conventional intracellular recordings in combination with nerve stimulation, single pulse 3 ms width, 0.8–2.1 V, using the isolated stimulation head. We used the spike sorting by template interactive script provided in Spike2 v.7 (Cambridge Electronic Design, Cambridge, UK) for the single unit analysis. Each record was imported to Spike2 and the cursors selected the key impulse epochs in time with the help of auxiliary channel displaying the movement of the platform. Spike templates were typically made from the first run through the record, and by the second run all the spikes were sorted. First and second principal components were used to visualize clouds of single units. These clouds of single units were checked with PCA to not intersect. Usually default parameters and time window of spike length work well and generate 5–13 additional channels of single unit activity. Early phases of gravitaxis reaction When the platform upon which the snail is attached is suddenly pitched from horizontal to vertical, the snail displays a fear-like reaction by fully or partially withdrawing its tentacles (designed phase 0; Figure1A). This reaction (latency of withdrawal is <1 s) is believed mediated by the gravi-sensing statocyst organ, the snail's equivalent to a vertebrate's vestibular otolith organ. Therefore, the differences in magnitude and time (duration) of the resulting tentacle elongation phase likely reveal changes in reaction of the snail's statocyst. We define the phase of fast elongation of tentacles before the snail starts to turn its body as the T0 phase of gravitaxis (Figure1A). Our previous report (Balaban et al.,2011) did not follow this convention, and thus the behavior seen in phase T0 of Figure2Adoes not correctly align with our current convention because the length of tentacles were not fully extended. At the end of T0 phase the rapid tentacle elongation is complete and the black eyes on their tips are clearly recognizable in most of the records, both of which occur before the head actually starts to move. Snails often start turning to T1 phase immediately after some amount of “hesitation” or scanning the space around them by moving the head from side to side. There was no significant difference between groups in the count of scanning movements (p= 0.114 by Fisher's Exact Test with Monte-Carlo simulatedp-value based on 99999 replicates); 82 of 88 (93%) snails of all groups turned the body to position the head above the shell in T2 phase.

Temporal parameters (latencies and durations) of gravitaxis phases A comparison of phase T1 latency between PF to the four control groups shows no statistically significant difference between them (KWp= 0.195). There are few outliers in the dataset, so we applied robust statistics as well, which resulted only in marginal significance (KWp= 0.039, DBHpadj= 0.01 for PF-ST only). A similar result was found with T1 duration (T1 latency–T0 latency), with an insignificant difference between groups (KWp= 0.106) in unfiltered dataset and significant for only two control groups if Tukey's outliers were filtered out (KWp= 0.02, DBHpadj= 0.003 for PF-ST andpadj= 0.023 for PF-DK). Tentacles withdrawal during gravitaxis reaction Changes of tentacle length during the gravitaxis behavior are shown in Figure2A. No significant asymmetry in tentacle withdrawal reaction was found in any group (p= 0.483, dependentt-test), and thus data for left and right tentacles were averaged. A comparison of phase 0 tentacle withdrawal reaction (Figure2B) of the four control groups to the PF group reveals that PF snails are retracting their tentacles to a lesser degree than the snails in each control group (KWp= 0.009, DBHpadj< 0.035 for 3 of 4 control groups, and insignificantpadj= 0.1 for PF-ST comparison). The later dynamics of the tentacle lengths show more complicated differences between the groups. After a relatively fast elongation of the tentacles during phase T0 (8–15 s), the snails in all groups slowly elongated their tentacles ~10–30% more during T1 phase (Figure2A). After phase T1 tentacle length reached a plateau in all control groups, with a higher length seen in OL snails than in the NV, ST, and DK snails (insignificantly during T1-T2, at tendency level (p< 0.1) at T3, and significantly for T4 (against all groups including PF: KWp= 0.02, DBHpadj max= 0.049; Figure2C). The tentacle length of PF snails during the late gravitaxis phases showed different dynamics (Figure2A). At T1 it reached a maximum (~130% of T0, close to OL group value), and then gradually declined over time to ~T0 length at the end of T4 phase. The same data in Figure2Aare normalized in Figure2Dfor tentacle length at phase T1 as 100%, but the procedure did not change the direction of observed effects. Inter-tentacle angle during gravitaxis reaction Correlation analysis of gravitaxis reaction A correlation analysis was made between the merged datasets of the four control groups and the PF dataset (Figure3). Phase T1-T4 latencies and durations are positively correlated among themselves in both PF and joined control group of snails, as well as tentacle length, and, to a lesser amount, the inter-tentacle angles. In the PF group correlations between inter-tentacle angles of early and late phases is higher than in controls. Delta (T0-0) inter-tentacle angle is weakly positively correlated with tentacle length in controls but not in the PF group. In PF group delta (T0-0) is correlated with latency, but no such a correlation was seen in the merged control. As expected, the number of head scanning movements is positively correlated with latency for all phases. In control dataset tentacle lengths show weak negative correlations with temporal parameters (most pronounced and significant for T0 latency and length, Figure3A). For the PF group no such a correlation was found (Figure3B). Latencies and inter-tentacle angles show weak negative correlations in both PF and control groups. In PF group tentacle lengths show weak positive correlations with inter-tentacle angle (although insignificant with the sample size used), in contrast to control dataset showing no such correlation. Positive correlation of snail weight with duration of “ascending” phases T2 and T3 is more pronounced in PF group then in control, also as negative correlation with duration of T1.

Foton-M3 behavioral data reanalysis The surface structure of the statoconia mass from groups PF, OL and ST was imaged by SEM to examine the role of possible statoconia growth after 30-day exposure to μG conditions (Figure4). Although the sample size is small (one statocyst in each group), no crustations or “flake-like” structures were observed in the statoconia of the PF sample that might indicate a deposition of calcium carbonate; no differences were found in either statoconia shape or surface structure between groups. The statoconia areas were calculated from SEM images in ImageJ ROI manager, and a tracing tool with minimal manual correction selected each region. No significant difference was found between groups (μm2, PF: 218.9 ± 12.24, OL: 196.6 ± 12.59, ST: 235.5 ± 14.8, n. s.padj≥ 0.43 in DBH pairwise comparisons against PF group). SEM images of statoconia.(A–C), Low magnification view used for area calculations;(D–F), Maximal magnification of typical statoconia. Columns represent statoconia preparations from different groups:(A,D), PF group;(B,E), OL group;(C,F), ST group. Transcriptome analysis of statocysts We allocated 3,544 transcripts with a significant difference between FPKM values in the control (ST) and experiment (PF-e) groups. These transcripts were annotated by BLAST homology finding. NP database was used for alignment. There were 2,288 proteins annotated. It is useful to note that many transcripts have similar annotation. For example, Cd-specific metallothionein gene was found 373 times. Possible explanations may be a clustering of similar genes or a very aggressive PCR. Fifty of the most significant differential expression genes (p< 0.05) are listed in TableS1and the most interesting of them are shown on the heatmap diagram of Figure5. Among the most significant differentially expressed genes are the neuronal specific precursors of neuropeptides, neurotransmitter receptor subunits, and other genes involved in cell signaling. This result of transcriptome analysis unambiguously identified the statocyst itself as the site of neural plasticity during the process of readaptation to normal gravity after spaceflight. Raw data were deposited at NCBI Bioproject, accession numberPRJNA400816. The heatmap for FPKM value of most significant differential expression genes. Electrophysiological study of statocyst reflex arc In naïve snails we studied the reflex arc from statocyst sensory neurons to command and motoneurons for a defensive withdrawal behavior. Brief and weak electric shocks, delivered to statocyst nerve, exert an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) or triggers an action potential in Pa2 and Pa28 neurons (Figure6). The EPSP shape and its latency suggest a polysynaptic mechanism via unidentified interneurons. Command neurons of defensive behavior receive excitatory input from vestibular nerve.(A)Single shock 3 ms, 0.68 V;(B)single shock 3 ms, 1.5 V. Stimulation ofn. vestibularisexerts EPSP(A)or an action potential(B)in ipsi- and contralateral command neurons for defensive behavior. Electrophysiological studies: technical controls Postflight increase of statocyst response to vestibular stimulation The 30-day exposure to μG conditions in the Bion-M1 mission, as well as the shorter 12-day duration of the Foton-M3 mission, significantly affected the responses of the PF snails. Postflight snails of both projects arrived at the lab at comparable times (first nerve recording ~14 h after landing), and the same protocol was used in all preparations. As a result we can compare neural responses to identical tilt stimuli in the two postflight groups to check the dependence of statocyst adaptation to μG on the duration of mission. Figure8shows the comparison of statocyst tilt responses to mission duration. No statistically significant difference in number of spikes between the two postflight groups was found in pairwise comparisons [to tilt 3,050 ms range (1.1–2.9) s PF: 70.15 ± 3.84 vs. PF2007: 72.5 ± 8.042, KWp= 0.72; for tilt 550 ms range (0.2–1.4) s PF: 52.59 ± 2.73 vs. PF2007: 54 ± 5.74, KWp= 0.8], suggesting the response adaptation to μG reaches a plateau at a time shorter than 12 days. Comparison of Bion-M1 and Foton-M3 postflight groups reveals an independence of microgravity adaptation on mission duration.(A)Response to c1 stimulus with duration 3,050 ms.(B)Response to c1 stimulus with duration 550 ms. Filled symbols represent PF snails and open symbols the corresponding control snails (see legend box). Readaptation to normal gravity Once the satellite leaves orbit it re-enters the Earth's atmosphere. At this point the organism experiences a hyper-gravity force until touchdown, about 45 min later. Readaptation likely begins during the re-entry phase and determines how quickly the organism recovers. The first and last nerve recordings of PF snails were made 14.75 and 26.13 h after landing, respectively. The PF snails were split into an early PF-e (<20 h after landing) and late PF-l (>20 h after landing) subgroups, and compared individually to the OL snails to reveal the process of readaptation of statocyst function. The statocyst response of PF-e subgroup was significantly larger than that of PF-l subgroup and most OL snails (Figure9). Responses to tilt in the range (0.5–1.7) s were significantly larger in the two analyzed directions in PF-e subgroup (for c1 PF-e: 54.67 ± 4.16, PF-l: 36.75 ± 7.11, OL: 31 ± 2.13, DBH pairwise comparison against PF-epadj= 0.073 (n. s.—butpadj= 0.03 with Tukeypost-hoctest) for PF-l andpadj= 0.002 for OL; for c3 (PF-e: 46.17 ± 3.64, PF-l: 29.75 ± 2.29, OL: 27.47 ± 1.89, DBH pairwise comparison against PF-epadj= 0.038 for PF-l andpadj= 0.001 for OL). The readaptation process in two different missions was compared by similarly splitting the electrophysiological data of Foton-M3 by time of preparation recording at 20 h after landing. Only two preparations were recorded before this critical time, but the overall picture is very similar to that obtained from Bion-M1 dataset (FigureS6). Statistics for such a small sample may be not reliable, but the required confidence level was reached for difference between early and lately recorded PF2007 subgroups, also as with control DK2007 group [range (1.3–2.2) s pairwise comparison against PF2007-e: 54 ± 2 vs. 32 ± 4.9 PF2007-l,padj= 0.04, DK2007: 21.88 ± 3.11,padj= 0.003; Tukeypost-hoctest].

Tilt duration is given by the gray bar at the bottom of each plot. Effect of tilt direction on statocyst response and single unit analysis Responses to tilt in the direction of head down to horizon position (c1) were larger than any other vestibular stimuli in preparations from all control groups and the PF group (see FiguresS4,S8). The effect was more profound in the period immediately after the stimulus end (tonic response), and more obvious on cumulative plots (FigureS9). Experiments using a reversed order of stimuli (to control for conditioning) showed that there is some effect of the sequence (note the increased response to c4 direction on FigureS4); but even if the stimulus in c1 direction was presented last in the sequence, it generated the larger response of the statocyst. Single unit analysis of statocyst activity.(A,D), Responses of single unit showed maximal response to stimulus c1.(B,C), Responses of a separate single unit showed maximal response to stimulus c3.

Upon entry into orbit the satellite is in a constant free fall back toward Earth and the traveler feels weightless. The neural gravity sensors that control normal balance and equilibrium are now forced to operate in a unique environment. The present experiments sought to identify the consequences of a 30-day orbital mission on the behavioral performance of snails challenged by a vestibular perturbation after return to normal 1G starting 14–15 h after landing. To account for possible environmental and habitat factors of unmanned spaceflights that can affect measured parameters of behavior other than those related to the state of weightlessness, we designed four control groups based on housing, food and water availability, and lighting, and included a landing-like simulation. In brief, we found that the behavioral phases most directly correlated with gravity sensation were the most affected by the vestibular perturbations tested as soon as the snails reached the laboratory after landing. Snails belonging to the same genus ofHelix(H. aspersa), the common garden snail, were exposed to increased gravitation by centrifugation for 16 and 32 days and showed an increased latency or slowing of T3 phase of gravitaxis (Popova and Boyle,2015). In the data of Bion-M1 project opposite effects in PF snails to the control snails were not seen. There is no consistency between the different Bion-M1 control groups in this parameter, although two groups with most controlled conditions (DK and OL) did show shorter T1-T4 latencies than PF group. For Foton-M3 data (with comparable snail size used), all available latencies (up to T2) are shorter than in preflight controls, thus in agreement with the hypothesis that gravitaxis temporal parameters will change in an opposite fashion after μG than after hypergravity. No differences in T4 duration between μG PF and control groups of snails were found in the data of Bion-M1, also in agreement with the previous study of hypergravity influences and the assumption that the T4 phase may reflect more motor than vestibular function in snails (Popova and Boyle,2015). Vestibular stimuli sensed by statocysts were shown to be connected to tentacles withdrawal and generalized defensive reaction in snails (see Figure6here; Balaban,1993). Pierantoni (1983) showed the connection of the vertical angle of tentacles and the function of snail statocysts using a spinning disk, and speculated that the vertical angle between the tentacles and the surface is associated with fear in the snail and will depend on the inclination of surface. Inter-tentacle angle in land snails has been investigated mostly in the context of olfactory orientation (Chase and Croll,1981; Davis,2004; Davis-Berg,2012), although tentacle connection with collumellar musculature and hydroskeleton may provide some mechanistic relation of the inter-tentacle angle with muscular or hydraulic tonus of snail; for example, in experiments with predatory snails inter-tentacle angle seems to be correlated with speed of snail crawling (Davis,2004; Davis-Berg,2012). In our experiments inter-tentacle angles were measured from the screenshots of different phases of gravitaxis reaction, and the analysis revealed a tendency of the angle to become narrower in late phases in all groups of Bion-M1 and Foton-M3 experiments (FiguresS1A,S2C). No specific effects of prolonged μG (PF snails) or short centrifugation (OL snails) on inter-tentacle angle were found in Bion-M1 experiments, although a decrease of inter-tentacle angle in all phases of gravitaxis was found in Foton-M3 experiment (FigureS2C). A possible cause for this discrepancy is a difference of experimental design: repeated testing of snails in Foton-M3 project as opposed to only one test in Bion-M1 snails. Transcriptome analysis of statocysts Adaptation to spaceflight and readaptation process The response sensitivity of utricular afferents in the vertebrate toadfish,Opsanus tau, taken post-landing of the orbiters STS-90 (NeuroLab; 16 days in orbit) and STS-95 (9 days in orbit) missions revealed an induced profound hypersensitivity to translational acceleration tests (Boyle et al.,2001). Recordings were also made in separate populations of afferents at numerous time periods after landing to track the rate of recovery. Although some afferents remained hypersensitive, the population as a whole recovered within 24–36 h comparable to readaptation time of snail sensory cells and experienced astronauts, and a bit shorter than a 2–3 day space motion sickness period reported in astronauts during 1G readaptation following 6-month manned missions (Heer and Paloski,2006). It can be argued in the vertebrate that the rate of adaptation to spaceflight and its recovery after return to Earth are more consistent with a restructuring of the synaptic organization between the hair cells and the afferents, such as adjusting the number of synaptic ribbons or bodies (Ross,2000), than a restructuring the weight-lending otolith (see below). The toadfish study could not identify whether the hypersensitivity originated in the hair cell, the hair cell-afferent complex, or postsynaptically in the afferent itself. In our Foton and Bion-M1 studies in the snail statocyst we recorded directly from the output of the statoreceptors themselves. Although it is tempting to speculate that the hair cells in vertebrates are also the targets of the sensitivity adjustment to altered gravity loads, direct evidence is still lacking. Vestibular sensitivity in the statocyst of the garden snail was recently studied following exposure to hyper-gravity conditions using centrifugation (Popova and Boyle,2015). A significant decrease in response sensitivity to head-down tilt was detected after 16- and 32-day (but not 4-day) exposures to a 1.4G [resultant = √1G (Earth)2+ 1G (centripetal)2]. After a 7-day recovery period in normal 1G the responses returned to normal. In accordance with the present study the prevalent gravity level appears represented as a continuum in statocyst function over the measured periods of time. Critical data that are missing and subject to future investigations are the initial responses of the statocyst and organism to an abrupt change in gravity load, the functional and structural consequences of long-term exposure to altered gravity, and the time course of recovery of function as a function of load and duration of exposure. Light cycle influences on the statocyst response Activity recorded in the lip sensory nerve in semi-intactHelixpreparations can reflect the circadian phase to which the snail is adapted (Voss et al.,1997). In that study chemical stimuli presented in the light elicited an increased neural response when they corresponded in time to the snail's normal active phase of behavior,viz. scotophase. This species is known to have an endogenous circadian oscillator entrained by light (Bailey and Lazaridou-Dimitriadou,1986; Attia,2004), and the circadian pattern of locomotor activity remains with a period of ~25 h in constant darkness for at least 20 days (Bailey and Lazaridou-Dimitriadou,1986). Inertial mass as adaptation mechanism In addition, our physiological data showed no difference in the magnitude of the sensitivity changes between the postflight groups of our separate missions having different duration of μG exposure (shown in Figure8). Thus, there is no substantive evidence for a mechanism inducing a change in statoconia mass for snails exposed to μG for less than a month. For the process of readaptation to normal gravity, postflight groups of Bion-M1 and Foton-M3 studies both divided into two distinct subgroups by the critical time of recording 20 h after landing. It is even less likely that changes in statoconia play any role in this readaptation process of such short duration. Taking into account 20 h as critical time of readaptation, neural plasticity of statocyst sensory statoreceptors themselves, central circuits, or both might be better candidates. Role of efferent vestibular neurons The vertebrate inner ear sensory organs receive centripetal innervation of their hair cells (and the dendrites of afferent neurons) by centrally located efferent neurons. This strategy is also present in snail statocyst: the statocyst nerve contains the axons of the statoreceptors as well as axons of neurons from the cerebral ganglion on each side. How the efferent neurons influence the gravity and acceleration sensations during and after space flight is unknown. Assuming the efferent innervation serves to tune the receptor's response to acceleration in a behaviorally relevant context (Goldberg et al.,2002; Boyle et al.,2009; Rabbitt et al.,2010), μG might trigger a shut down of the efferent system to allow an amplification of any input, now weak or absent, signal. If so, this might temporarily lead to a hypersensitivity in snail statoreceptors. In an attempt to address this key issue, we analyzed the firing behavior of presumed efferent neurons to tilt and found it was monotonous within each examined group of snails. Thus, direct evidence that the efferents play a role in the postflight statoreceptor hypersensitivity was not found. We cannot rule out however that the efferent neurons were studied in a behaviorally irrelevant context, namely in the isolated neural preparation and not in the intact animal, and postflight but not inflight. Directionality of response and single unit analysis The only viable candidate to explain the existence of directional response with higher sensitivity (“head down,” c1) is the unpaired sensory neuron at the anterior pole of the statocyst (see Figure13). Responding to perturbations of vertical orientation of the organism, including human, in the “head down” direction are of critical importance for self-protection, and the unpaired sensory neuron at the anterior pole of the statocyst adds to the net information signal of tilt stimuli in this biologically meaningful direction. Marine mollusks require a fast and reliable recognition of spatial orientation from variable external cues to maintain proper balance and 3D navigation in the sea, and thus their statocyst is the most studied among invertebrates (Wood and Von Baumgarten,1972; Alkon,1975; Janse,1983; Budelmann and Williamson,1994; Deliagina et al.,1998). In freshwater species, pulmonateLymnaea, the statocyst output is important for periodical trips to the surface for breathing (Janse,1982). Janse et al. (1988) compared the statoreceptors firing rate and gain in marineAplysiaand freshwaterLymnaeaand speculated that the difference in ecology of the animals leads to a more sensitive statocyst inAplysia. For land snails vestibular function is important for gravitaxis reaction, when the animals climb to elevated positions for diurnal rest in hot and dry day-time, and when returning back to the soil at dusk (Cowie,1985; Aubry et al.,2006; Di Lellis et al.,2012). Another obvious biological significance of statocyst function is its role in the withdrawal reaction, as a sudden change of the body position may preclude an attack of a predator. In agreement with ecology of land snails, our physiological data show that theHelixstatocyst operates more for coding the orientation of animal's body than fast changes in its direction.
