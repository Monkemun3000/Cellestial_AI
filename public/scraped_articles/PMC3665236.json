Amani Wan Salim atasalim@purdue.edu Lab-on-a-chip (LOC) applications in environmental, biomedical, agricultural, biological, and spaceflight research require an ion-selective electrode (ISE) that can withstand prolonged storage in complex biological media1-4. An all-solid-state ion-selective-electrode (ASSISE) is especially attractive for the aforementioned applications. The electrode should have the following favorable characteristics: easy construction, low maintenance, and (potential for) miniaturization, allowing for batch processing. A microfabricated ASSISE intended for quantifying H+, Ca2+, and CO32-ions was constructed. It consists of a noble-metal electrode layer (i.e.Pt), a transduction layer, and an ion-selective membrane (ISM) layer. The transduction layer functions to transduce the concentration-dependent chemical potential of the ion-selective membrane into a measurable electrical signal. Calibrations in test solutions demonstrated that the MAB can monitor pH (operational range pH 4-9), CO32-(measured range 0.01 mM - 1 mM), and Ca2+(log-linear range 0.01 mM to 1 mM). The MAB for pH provides a near-Nernstian slope response after almost one month storage in algal medium. The carbonate biochips show a potentiometric profile similar to that of a conventional ion-selective electrode. Physiological measurements were employed to monitor biological activity of the model system, the microalgaChlorella vulgaris. The MAB conveys an advantage in size, versatility, and multiplexed analyte sensing capability, making it applicable to many confined monitoring situations, on Earth or in space. 1. Preparation of Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):Poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) Electropolymerization Solution for H+and CO32-Ions Add 70 mg poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) (Na+PSS-) to 10 ml deionized (DI) water and vortex until completely dispersed (approx. 10 sec). Add 10.7 μl 3,4-ethlyenedioxythiophene (EDOT) to the solution in 1.1 and vortex until solution is completely mixed. 2. Preparation of Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):Calcium sulphate (PEDOT:CaSO4) Electropolymerization Solution for Ca2+Ions Add 136 mg calcium sulphate (CaSO4) to 10 ml DI water and vortex; the solution will not completely disperse and appears milky. Add 10.7 μl EDOT to the solution in 2.1 and vortex until completely mixed. 3. Electropolymerization of PEDOT-based Conductive Polymer Now clip a platinum-gauze at the counter electrode position of the electrochemical cell. Then clip the MAB at the working electrode position of the electrochemical cell with the working electrodes facing the platinum-gauze. Adjust the MAB depth so that only the circular electrodes are submerged in the PEDOT:PSS electropolymerization solution. Avoid solution contact with the square electrical contact pads. Place a BASI saturated silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) electrode in the reference electrode position of the electrochemical cell. Make sure that the reference electrode is not in between the working and counter electrodes. For PEDOT:PSS deposition: Bubble the electrochemical cell for 20 min, and use the EC epsilon potentiostat/galvanostat to run a single cyclic voltammogram from 0V - 1.1V with a scan rate of 20 mV/sec on a ±100 μA scale. For PEDOT:CaSO4deposition: Bubble the electrochemical cell for 20 min, and use the EC epsilon potentiostat/galvanostat to run chronopotentiometry at 814 nA for 30 min. 4. Cyclic Voltammetry of PEDOT-based Polymer Conjugates in K3Fe(CN)6 Use the EC epsilon potentiostat/galvanostat to run single cyclic voltammograms from -653 mV to 853 mV with varying scan rates of (25, 50, 75, 100, l25, 150, 175, 200) mV/sec on a ±10 μA scale. 5. Surface Functionalization Protocol Deposit conductive polymer conjugate specific for the ions of interest as in Step 3. Apply ion-selective membrane as in Step 6. 6. Application of Ion-selective Membrane Center the MAB on the vacuum spinner chuck. Deposit 100 μl membrane onto the center of the MAB and run. Spin-coat ion-selective membrane with a spin coater at 1,500 rpm for 30 sec with a 5 sec ramp up and down. Vacuum the spin-coated MAB for 30 min and bake the chip in an oven at 70 °C for 20 min. 7. Calibration of PEDOT-PSS Conductive Polymer Conjugate with pH and Carbonate (CO32-) Ion-selective Membrane Condition the MAB overnight in 10 μM sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) and 5 mM potassium chloride (KCl) in algal media. Insert the MAB into the microfluidic flow-cell chip holder. Inject 5 ml test solution with initial pH value or concentration (e.g.pH 4 or 10 μM for CO32-). Remove bubbles from the flow-cell chip holder. Place the flow-cell chip holder onto the flow-cell electrical fixture. Open the EC epsilon software and enter open-circuit potential (OP) mode. Set the time to 300 min, the voltage scale to ± 1V, and the cutoff frequency to 10 kHz, and record the value every 2 sec. Let the MAB stabilize (look for a flat line) before continuing with the calibration process. Once the MAB is stabilized, flush the flow cell with test solution and inject the next concentration to be calibrated (pH 5 or 25 μM CO32-). Make sure that no bubbles are allowed to enter the flow cell. Repeat steps 7.5 and 7.6 for pH 6, 7, 8, and 9 or CO32-concentrations of 50, 75, 100, 250, 500, 750, and 1,000 μM. After the last concentration has run, remove the MAB and dry with nitrogen air. Place the MAB back into fresh conditioning solution until next use. 8. Calibration of PEDOT:CaSO4Conductive Polymer Conjugate in CaCl2 Condition the MAB overnight in 7 ml of 0.1 M CaCl2and 10 μM NaNO3. Follow steps similar to 7.2 - 7.10. In step 8.3, replace carbonate test solution with an initial concentration of 0.01 mM CaCl2. Repeat for test-solution concentrations of 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1 and 10 mM. An example of a cyclic voltammogram (CV) result of PEDOT:PSS and its corresponding cathodic peak current (ip) vs. the scan rate (v1/2) are shown inFigures 5aand5brespectively. PEDOT:CaSO4at various scan rates and its cathodic peak current are not shown. Using Randles-Sevcik analysis10, the effective surface areas of the solid contact PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:CaSO4without ion-selective membrane were found to be 4.4 x 10-11cm2and 5.8 x 10-11cm2, respectively. These values are relatively small in comparison to previous reported electrodes owing to the electrode size being ~130 times smaller than the electrode size reported from our research group11. Note that the MAB electrode effective surface area could be enhanced by modifying the surface with nanomaterials11. For all measurements, the measurement linear range is tailored to fit the range required for the application. The MAB biochip consists of ASSISEs that are constructed from an ISM atop a PEDOT-based CP conjugate transduction layer on a Pt electrode, the combination of which transduces the ionic concentration of interest to a measurable electrical signal. A stable electrode potential is defined by both the CP layer and the ISM layer. Both layers also determine the working lifetime of the MAB and the quality (noise, drift) of the measured electrical signal.",
