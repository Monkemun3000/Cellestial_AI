Staiger,staiger@purdue.edu Received 2023 Feb 22; Accepted 2023 May 15; Collection date 2023. • The proteomics profile of Arabidopsis plasma membrane proteins changes following 2-h treatment with the EXO70A1 inhibitor, ES2. The plant plasma membrane serves as a selective physical barrier between intracellular contents and the environment as well as a signaling platform for transmitting information from the exterior to induce cellular responses. Plasma membrane proteins can be classified as integral, lipid-anchored, and peripheral, based on the mode of association with the plasma membrane (Stillwell, 2016). Integral membrane proteins possess one to several transmembrane domains; lipid-anchored proteins associate with the plasma membrane through covalently attached fatty acids; peripheral membrane proteins associate with the plasma membrane through interactions with other membrane proteins, polar head groups of the lipid bilayer, or both. Several well-characterized plasma membrane-localized nutrient transporters, hormone receptors and transporters, and cell wall biosynthetic enzymes are known to undergo constitutive delivery and turnover (Li et al., 2002;Friml, 2010;Takano et al., 2010;Kleine-Vehn et al., 2011;Irani et al., 2012;Bashline et al., 2013;Chen et al., 2015;Wang et al., 2015;Zhu et al., 2018;Vellosillo et al., 2021). Proteomic analyses of plasma membrane proteins reveal that the composition is altered in response to biotic and abiotic stresses (Nohzadeh Malakshah et al., 2007;Nouri and Komatsu, 2010;Elmore et al., 2012;Takahashi et al., 2013;Nie et al., 2015;Cao et al., 2016;Chen et al., 2016;Voothuluru et al., 2016); however, the mechanisms for delivery of most of these plasma membrane proteins are not well characterized. Investigating how plants maintain the variety, abundance, and dynamics of plasma membrane proteins is essential for understanding cell growth, development, and response to stresses. The conventional plant secretory pathway involves trafficking through the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi and post-Golgi vesicles to deliver lipids and proteins to the plasma membrane or extracellular space (Denecke et al., 2012;Drakakaki and Dandekar, 2013;Zhu et al., 2020;Aniento et al., 2022). The exocyst complex is a conserved octameric protein complex that primarily functions to mediate the tethering of secretory vesicles to the site of membrane fusion during the last step of exocytic trafficking (Elias et al., 2003;Zhang et al., 2010;Žárský et al., 2013;Wu and Guo, 2015;Synek et al., 2021;Žárský, 2022). In addition, the exocyst complex also associates with the endocytic and autophagy machinery to modulate membrane recycling and autophagy (Prigent et al., 2003;Kulich et al., 2013;Žárský et al., 2013;Ortega et al., 2022;Žárský, 2022). One plant exocyst subunit, EXO70A1, was recently characterized as a landmark for exocyst complex recruitment to the plasma membrane, through its interactions with anionic phospholipids (Synek et al., 2021). Loss of EXO70A1 function disrupts the recruitment of other exocyst subunits to the plasma membrane in Arabidopsis root epidermal cells (Synek et al., 2021). Some known cargo proteins for plant exocyst complex-mediated trafficking include PIN auxin transporters (Drdová et al., 2013), brassinosteroid receptor (Zhang et al., 2016), and cellulose synthase complexes (Zhu et al., 2018;Zhang et al., 2021). However, it is not known what other plasma membrane proteins are delivered to the plasma membrane through the exocyst complex. Whereas the half-life for turnover of plasma membrane proteins in mammalian cells varies from a few hours to a few days (Tweto and Doyle, 1976;Doyle and Baumann, 1979;Chu and Doyle, 1985), we know much less about the mechanisms and dynamics of protein delivery to the plasma membrane in plants. ArabidopsisPIP2A-GFP seeds (Cutler et al., 2000) were sterilized and sowed on half-strength Murashige and Skoog (½ MS) media with vitamins (Caisson Labs, Smithfield, UT, USA), 1% (w/v) sucrose, and 0.8% (w/v) agar (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The seeds were well separated from each other in both horizontal and vertical orientations on 10 cm x 10 cm square petri plates. Plates were placed in vertical orientation so that the seedings grew on the surface of the agar media. The plants were grown in a growth chamber (Percival Scientific, Perry, IA, USA) under continuous light of 130 μmol m-2s-1at 23°C. Six-day-old seedlings were removed from the agar plates and transferred to liquid ½ MS media with 1% (w/v) sucrose and 40 μM ES2 or 0.5% DMSO (mock). After two hours of treatment under light, the roots of the seedlings were quickly excised and transferred to the plasma membrane enrichment buffer. The process of plasma membrane enrichment followed exactly the published protocol (Collins et al., 2017). To evaluate the enrichment of plasma membrane proteins by Western blot assay, 12 μg of protein from each fraction was loaded onto SDS-PAGE gels and the presence of PIP2A-GFP, Sec12, and SYP41 was detected after transfer to PVDF membrane. The anti-GFP antibody was used at 1:1000 dilution (Takara Bio USA, catalog # 632381, San Jose, CA, USA); anti-Sec12 antibody (Bar-Peled and Raikhel, 1997) was used at 1:5000 dilution; and anti-SYP41 antibody (Bassham et al., 2000) was used at 1:500 dilution. HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit antibodies were used at 1:10,000 dilution. The plasma membrane enrichment experiments were repeated four times under identical conditions. Methanol-chloroform precipitation The mass spectrometry sample preparation procedure was based on previous literature (Hsu et al., 2018). Protein concentrations from enriched plasma membrane fractions were quantified using the bicinchoninic acid method. For each sample, 250 μg of enriched plasma membrane protein was processed for mass spectrometry analysis. Proteins from each sample were reduced and alkylated with 10 mM tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TECP) and 40 mM chloroacetamide (CAA) at 95°C for 5 min. Methanol, chloroform, and ddH2O were added to each 100 µl sample in a volume ratio of 4:1:3, respectively (Wessel and Flügge, 1984). The solution was mixed and centrifuged at 16,000x g for 3 min to obtain aqueous and organic phases. Four volumes of methanol were added to the sample after removing the upper aqueous layer carefully without disturbing the intermediate protein disk. The solution was mixed and centrifuged again at the same settings. The supernatant was removed, the precipitated protein pellet was washed with 400 µL methanol, and the sample was air-dried. The precipitated protein pellet was dissolved with 100 µl of 12 mM sodium deoxycholate (SDC) and 12 mM sodium lauroyl sarcosinate (SLS) in 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5). Protein amount was quantified by BCA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Dissolved protein extract was diluted 5-fold with 50 mM triethylammonium hydrogen carbonate buffer (TEAB) and digested with Lys-C (Wako Chemicals USA Inc., Richmond, VA, USA) in a ratio of 1:100 (w/w) enzyme-to-protein ratio for 3 h at 37°C, and trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) in a ratio of 1:50 (w/w) enzyme-to-protein ratio for overnight at 37°C. SDC and SLS were removed by adding 100% acetyl acetate in a ratio of 1:1 (vol/vol) sample to acetyl acetate volume ratio. The digests were desalted by homemade stage tip with styrene divinyl benzene (SDB-XC) membrane (3M) after the digests were acidified with 10% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to a pH ~3. Every 50–100 µg of tryptic peptides was dissolved in 100 µl of 100 mM TEAB and mixed with 4 µl of 4%13CD2O or12CH2O, and then 4 µl of freshly prepared 0.6 M sodium cyanoborohydride was immediately added (Boersema et al., 2009). The mixture was agitated for 1 h at room temperature. The reaction was quenched by adding 16 µl of ice-cold 1% ammonium hydroxide and agitated for 1 min. Heavy and light dimethyl-labeled peptides were mixed after the labeled peptides were acidified with 20 µl of 10% formic acid and then fractionated by basic pH reverse-phase stage tips. Basic pH reverse-phase fractionation Two mg of the Magic C18-AQ beads (5 µm particles) were suspended in 200 µL of methanol and loaded into a 200 µL StageTip with a 20 µm polypropylene frit (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) (Dimayacyac-Esleta et al., 2015). The C18 StageTip was activated with 50 µL of 100% acetonitrile (ACN) and washed with 50 µL of 200 mM ammonium formate, pH 10. After the StageTip was activated and washed, 25–50 µg of dimethyl-labeled peptides were fractionated from the StageTip with 50 µL of 6 different ACN concentrations: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25% and 80% of ACN in 200 mM ammonium formate, pH 10. The eluted peptides were dried and stored at -20°C. Twenty-five µg of dimethyl-labeled peptides used in fractionations were dissolved in 5 µL of 0.3% formic acid (FA) with 3% ACN and 4 µL of each fraction injected into an EasynLC 1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were separated on a 45 cm in-house packed column (360 µm OD × 75 µm ID) containing C18 resin (2.2 µm, 100Å, Michrom Bioresources, Auburn, CA, USA) with a 30 cm column heater (Analytical Sales and Services, Flanders, NJ, USA) set at 60°C. The mobile phase buffer for 25 µg peptide fractions consisted of 0.1% FA in ultrapure water (buffer A) with an eluting buffer of 0.1% FA in 80% ACN (buffer B) run with a 150 min gradient of 5–30% buffer B at a flow rate of 250 nL/min. The Easy-nLC 1000 was coupled online with a Velos Pro LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The mass spectrometer was operated in the data-dependent mode in which a full MS scan (from m/z 350–1500 with a resolution of 30,000 at m/z 400) was followed by MS/MS of the 10 most intense ions being subjected to collision-induced dissociation (CID) fragmentation (normalized collision energy–30%, automatic gain control–3E4, max injection time–100 ms). The raw files were searched directly against theArabidopsis thalianaprotein database (TAIR10) with no redundant entries using MaxQuant software (version 1.6.1.0) (Tyanova et al., 2016a) with 1% false-discovery rate (FDR) cutoff for protein and peptide. The first peptide precursor mass tolerance was set at 20 ppm, and MS/MS tolerance was set at 0.6 Da. Search criteria included a static carbamidomethylation of cysteines and variable modifications of oxidation on methionine residues and acetylation at N-terminus of proteins. The search was performed with full tryptic digestion and allowed a maximum of two missed cleavages on the peptides analyzed from the sequence database. Dimethyl-labeling quantitation was performed by setting the multiplicity as 2 (DimethLys0 and DimethNter0; DimethLys6 and DimethNter6). Re-quantify and match between runs function were enabled. After database searches, the Perseus software platform (Version 1.6.1.3) (Tyanova et al., 2016b) was used to further analyze the MaxQuant-derived protein groups file. First, the rows marked to be “only identified by site”, “reverse” and “potential contaminants” were filtered out. The Heavy/Light ratio was transformed to Light/Heavy (L/H) ratio for convenience, and then to log2L/H ratio. Normalization was performed by median subtraction. Proteins with less than 3 valid values among the 4 replicates were filtered out. One sample t-test was performed with both side and p-value threshold of 0.05. Proteins that passed t-test and with a mean log2L/H ratio ≤ -0.32193 were considered to be 20% reduction candidates. Histogram and multi-scatter plots were generated by Perseus software. The reduced abundance candidate list was uploaded to PANTHER platform for Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, including functional classification and statistical overrepresentation (Mi et al., 2013;Mi et al., 2017). The Venn diagram was generated using the online tool provided by Van de Peer Lab at the Bioinformatics and Evolutionary Genomics Core of Ghent University, Belgium (http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/Venn/). The presence of signal peptide and transmembrane domains in candidate proteins was predicted using the DeepTMHMM package (v1.0.24) provided by Department of Bio and Health Informatics, Technical University of Denmark (https://dtu.biolib.com/DeepTMHMM) (Hallgren et al., 2022). For imaging of fluorescence-tagged protein marker lines, 6-d-old light-grown seedlings expressing PIN2-GFP (Xu and Scheres, 2005), BRI1-GFP (Wang et al., 2001), FER-GFP (Escobar-Restrepo et al., 2007), PIP2A-GFP (Cutler et al., 2000), or GFP-EXO70A1 (Fendrych et al., 2010) were treated in liquid ½ MS medium containing 0.5% DMSO (mock) or 40 μM ES2 for 2 h. Live imaging was performed with a Zeiss LSM 710 Axio Imager laser-scanning confocal microscope operated with Zeiss ZEN software (Carl Zeiss Microscopy LLC, White Plains, NY, USA). The PIN2-GFP, BRI1-GFP, FER-GFP and PIP2A-GFP lines were imaged with a Zeiss Plan-Apochromat 100x/NA1.40 DIC Oil immersion objective at 2048×2048 pixel scanning resolution. The GFP-EXO70A1 line was imaged with a Zeiss Plan-Apochromat 63x/NA1.40 Oil immersion objective at 4096×4096 pixel scanning resolution. The GFP-EXO70A1 seedlings were stained with 10 μg/mL Propidium Iodide (PI) (Biotium Inc., Fremont, CA, USA; Cat # 40016) in ½ liquid MS medium containing DMSO or ES2 in the dark for 10 min, and quickly rinsed in PI-free medium before imaging. GFP was excited with a 488-nm laser line, and PI was excited with a 543-nm laser line. Images were collected from root epidermal cells at the transition zone. We chose to use a transgenic line expressing PIP2A-GFP as the plant material for our experiments because PIP2A-GFP is localized predominantly at the plasma membrane by microscopy and its cellular localization is not affected by 2 h of 40 μM ES2 treatment (Cutler et al., 2000;Zhang et al., 2016). The GFP tag also allowed the use of anti-GFP antibody to examine the quality of enriched plasma membrane fractions. Six-day-old PIP2A-GFP seedlings were treated with either 40 μM ES2 or 0.5% DMSO for 2 h, a condition in which plant exocytosis is reduced but not completely inhibited (Zhang et al., 2016). After treatment, roots were excised and used for plasma membrane enrichment (Figure 1A). We adapted a protocol that allows quick enrichment of plasma membrane and does not require large amounts of plant tissue (Zhang and Peck, 2011;Collins et al., 2017). Characterization of enriched plasma membrane fractions shows the high quality of the sample preparation.(A)Flowchart of sample preparation for mass spectrometry analysis.(B)Western blot characterization of enriched plasma membrane fractions. Protein amount of 12.5 μg from total protein (total), soluble protein (sup.), crude membrane fraction (crude M.) and enriched plasma membrane fraction (e.PM) was separated in SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membrane. The same membrane was blotted with anti-GFP, anti-Sec12 and anti-SYP41 antibodies.(C)The Venn diagram comparing the proteins that were identified from different proteomics experiments. Enrichment was evaluated by detecting the presence of proteins known to localize to the plasma membrane (PIP2A-GFP) (Cutler et al., 2000), endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Sec12) (Bar-Peled and Raikhel, 1997), and Golgi/trans-Golgi network (TGN) (SYP41) (Bassham et al., 2000) in different fractions using Western blots with anti-GFP, anti-Sec12, and anti-SYP41 antibodies, respectively (Figure 1B). PIP2A-GFP was enriched in the plasma membrane fraction when compared to the crude membrane fraction (Figure 1B, anti-GFP). The ER membrane protein, Sec12, was detected in both crude membrane and plasma membrane fractions; however, the abundance of Sec12 in the plasma membrane fraction was markedly lower than the crude membrane fraction (Figure 1B, anti-Sec12). The Golgi/TGN protein, SYP41, was detected in the crude membrane fraction but not in the enriched plasma membrane fraction (Figure 1B, anti-SYP41). Immunoblots demonstrated that although proteins from other organelles were present in the enriched plasma membrane fraction, their abundance was substantially reduced in comparison with plasma membrane proteins. We prepared four independent biological replicates of enriched plasma membrane fractions for the mass spectrometry proteomics analysis. Mass spectrometry analyses of enriched plasma membrane proteins From each enriched plasma membrane fraction, 25 μg of protein was digested with Lys-C and trypsin. Resulting peptides from ES2-treated plant samples were dimethyl labeled with12CH2O (light, L) and peptides from DMSO-treated samples were dimethyl labeled with13CD2O (heavy, H). Dimethyl-labeled peptides from ES2-treatment and control samples were combined and fractionated before LC-MS/MS analysis. The peptides that were detected by LC-MS/MS were assigned to proteins and the abundance of each protein was calculated through a MaxQuant database search. The ratio of each protein’s abundance in differentially labeled samples was calculated using the same process. The data were processed further with the Perseus platform by filtering out rows with invalid values (potential contaminants, the reverse peptides, and peptides only identified by site) from the MaxQuant database search. We further filtered the data by removing proteins with less than three detected values in the four replicates. To compare the data from different replicates, the ratio of protein abundance between differentially labeled proteins was transformed to log2phase and further normalized by median subtraction and then analyzed by histogram (Supplemental Figure S1). The normal distribution of log2phase of ratios centered by zero between differentially labeled proteins indicates that the majority of proteins that we detected were not altered by ES2 treatment.

Confocal imaging of GFP-tagged plasma membrane proteins following ES2 treatment Gene Ontology enrichment analysis of candidate cargos for ES2-targeted trafficking Gene Ontology terms of biological processes category that are enriched in our protein list with significantly reduced abundance after ES2 treatment. Numbers on each row represent: fold enrichment (total number of proteins in the category/number of proteins identified in the reduced protein list/number of proteins expected in reduced protein list). Fold enrichment represents the ratio of the number of proteins identified divided by the number of proteins expected in the list. In addition to the proteins mentioned above, there are other proteins with reduced abundance at the plasma membrane, but they were not enriched in functional groups in the GO enrichment analysis. These include multiple receptor-like protein kinases, transporters, enzymes for carbohydrate metabolism and protein glycosylation, as well as proteins with uncharacterized functions. Although these proteins were not enriched in our list, they may have diverse functions and cellular localization patterns among different members of the family. Collectively, our GO term enrichment analysis indicates that the exocyst complex mediates constitutive transport of numerous proteins that function in cell growth, cell wall biosynthesis, hormone signaling, stress response, and membrane transport. Bioinformatic analysis of potential cargo proteins for plant exocyst complex Plants use both conventional and unconventional trafficking pathways to deliver proteins to the plasma membrane and extracellular space (Drakakaki and Dandekar, 2013;Ding et al., 2014;Robinson et al., 2016;Aniento et al., 2022). In the conserved conventional trafficking pathway, proteins with a signal peptide are inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum during translation and are then transported to Golgi through vesicles and further secreted through post-Golgi vesicles (Novick et al., 1981;Rothman, 2002;Schekman, 2010). However, increasing evidence from proteomic analysis shows that many proteins that are secreted out of the cell or targeted to the plasma membrane do not have signal peptides, indicating the existence of unconventional trafficking pathways for these proteins (Oh et al., 2005;Soares et al., 2007;Wen et al., 2007;Han et al., 2010;Chen et al., 2016). Plant exocyst complex has been shown to regulate cargo proteins through both conventional and unconventional pathways (Wang et al., 2010;Drdová et al., 2013;Lin et al., 2015;Mayers et al., 2017). The behavior of the exocyst complex and its regulators is different than candidate cargo proteins Confocal imaging of GFP-EXO70A1 following ES2 treatment To investigate whether ES2 affects the spatial distribution or abundance at the plasma membrane of its target, EXO70A1, we performed live imaging of root epidermal cells from GFP-EXO70A1 seedlings using laser scanning confocal microscopy (Figure 4). Consistent with previous findings (Zhang et al., 2016;Larson et al., 2020;Synek et al., 2021), EXO70A1 in mock-treated epidermal cells showed a polarized distribution with highest abundance at the plasma membrane on the outer periclinal face, but was present at all six faces of the cell (Figure 4A). A 2-h, 40 µM ES2 treatment significantly reduced the abundance of EXO70A1 at the plasma membrane on the outer periclinal face (Figures 4B, D), and disrupted the polarized distribution of EXO70A1 at the outer periclinal face when fluorescence intensity was expressed as a ratio with the cytosolic region (Figure 4E) or as a ratio with the other faces of the same cell (Figure 4F). However, when EXO70A1 at the other three faces of the plasma membrane visible in medial optical sections, including the inner periclinal face and the two anticlinal faces (green line inFigure 4C), was examined, the apparent abundance expressed as a ratio with cytosol was not affected by ES2 treatment (Figure 4G). When all four faces of the plasma membrane were combined and averaged, there was a modest decrease in the abundance of EXO70A1, but this was not statistically significant (Figure 4H). In total, a 2-h ES2 treatment had greatest effect on the polarized distribution of EXO70A1 and its association with the plasma membrane at the outer periclinal face of root epidermal cells, but a rather modest reduction in overall abundance at the plasma membrane on all faces of the cell. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis of proteins with increased abundance after ES2 treatment Exocyst complex mediates constitutive transport of proteins with diverse functions during plant growth and development Cargo protein exocytosis and exocyst complex membrane association Previous studies demonstrate that exocyst subunits physically interact and associate with the SCD1/2 complex (Mayers et al., 2017), and EXO70 physically interacts with several SNAREs (Larson et al., 2020). Although ES2 disrupts the polarized localization of EXO70A1, our current data do not directly reflect whether ES2 disrupts the physical interaction of exocyst subunits with SCD1/2 complex or SNARE proteins, and/or affects the localization pattern of SCD1/2 and SNAREs. One future direction would be to quantify the localization of fluorescent-tagged SCD1/2 and SNAREs following ES2 treatment. Further, it would be interesting to quantify the association of exocyst subunits with other components of the exocytosis machinery through high spatial-temporal resolution live-cell imaging of double marker lines. Future directions in understanding plant plasma membrane protein dynamics Due to the importance of plant plasma membrane proteins, multiple comparative proteomic studies have been conducted to investigate the profiles of plasma membrane proteins in response to environmental stresses and cell growth status. The composition of plasma membrane proteins changes upon salt stress, cold treatment, osmotic stress, immune signaling, nutrient deficiency and different growth stages of cultured cells (Nohzadeh Malakshah et al., 2007;Nouri and Komatsu, 2010;Elmore et al., 2012;Li et al., 2012;Cao et al., 2016;Chen et al., 2016;Li et al., 2018). These proteomic studies show that the plasma membrane serves as a hub for cells to respond to environmental and growth cues. These studies further indicate that the vesicle trafficking machinery that facilitates the transport of these proteins is essential for plants to respond to biotic and abiotic stresses. Previous findings on the essential functions of plant exocyst complex in plant growth and immune responses (Synek et al., 2006;Fendrych et al., 2010;Kulich et al., 2010;Kulich et al., 2015;Cole et al., 2018;Du et al., 2018;Guo et al., 2018;Žárský, 2022) support the hypothesis that the exocyst complex choreographs the dynamic change of specific proteins at the plasma membrane in response to different environmental stimuli and growth cues. In comparison with yeast and mammalian cells, we understand less about the mechanisms of plasma membrane protein delivery and turnover in plants. In this study, using very stringent filtering and cutoff, we found 145 proteins that have significantly (at 10% FDR) reduced abundance at the plasma membrane after a 2-h, 40 μM ES2 treatment, a condition that inhibits but does not completely arrest exocytosis and plant growth. We found that the abundance of some plant plasma membrane proteins was reduced by more than 50%, indicating that the half-time of turnover of these proteins is less than 2 h. We speculate that these proteins undergo fast delivery to the plasma membrane mediated by the exocyst complex and have a rapid turnover at the plasma membrane. There are other proteins that have lower abundance in ES2-treated samples but did not pass the statistical test. We believe these proteins have slower delivery and/or turnover rates at the plasma membrane. It is not well understood how plants control precise delivery of cargo proteins with different dynamics. Using a 2-h treatment with the exocyst subunit EXO70A1 inhibitor ES2 in combination with plasma membrane enrichment, quantitative proteomic analyses, and live-cell imaging, we identified subsets of plasma membrane proteins that require the ES2-targeted exocyst complex for constitutive trafficking to the plasma membrane in Arabidopsis root cells.
