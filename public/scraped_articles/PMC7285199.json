This article is an open access article distributed under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Aging and healthspan are determined by both environmental and genetic factors. The insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1(IGF-1) pathway is a key mediator of aging inCaenorhabditis elegansand mammals. Specifically, DAF-2 signaling, an ortholog of human IGF, controls DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor, a master regulator of metabolism and longevity. Moreover, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are both linked to aging. We propose that daily supplementation of tart cherry extract (TCE), rich in anthocyanins with antioxidant properties may exert dual benefits for mitochondrial function and oxidative stress, resulting in beneficial effects on aging inC. elegans. We found that TCE supplementation at 6 μg or 12 μg/mL, increased (p< 0.05) the mean lifespan of wild type N2 worms, respectively, when compared to untreated control worms. Consistent with these findings, TCE upregulated (p< 0.05) expression of longevity-related genes such asdaf-16andaak-2(but notdaf-2orakt-1genes) and genes related to oxidative stress such assod-2. Further, we showed that TCE supplementation increased spare respiration in N2 worms. However, TCE did not change the mean lifespan ofdaf-16andaak-2mutant worms. In conclusion, our findings indicate that TCE confers healthspan benefits inC. elegansthrough enhanced mitochondrial function and reduced oxidative stress, mainly via the DAF-16 pathway. Aging has a significant influence on economy, health, and demography with healthy aging being a global challenge [1]. In 2018, ~16% of the United States population were 65 years old or over and expected to reach 23% by 2060 [2]. Globally, 9% of the population was old (over age 65) in 2019, which is expected to increase to 16% by 2050 [3]. Genetic and lifestyle factors contribute to aging and healthy lifespan. The effects of aging could be altered, and progression of aging could be slowed down [4]. Various factors contribute to aging such as defects in development and genetics, environmental factors, diseases, and reactive oxygen species (ROS), which cause harmful changes in cells and tissues [5]. Excessive ROS production causes oxidative stress, which is a predominant factor in the pathophysiology of various diseases and aging in human and other models [6] such asCaenorhabditis elegans(C. elegans) [7] andDrosophila[8]. Calorie restriction is the most established method for successfully extending lifespan of animals and model organisms such asC. elegans[9,10,11]. However, human studies are scarce [12], and the safety and effectiveness of calorie restriction for lifespan extension in humans is controversial [1]. Therefore, it is critical to identify dietary bioactive compounds that reduce ROS levels and thereby delay aging. Among the pathways and genes involved in lifespan regulation, DAF-16 is homologous to mammalian forkhead box O1 (FOXO) transcription factor, and a key lifespan extension transcription factor that is highly conserved across a variety of organisms such as flies, worms, rodents, and humans [12,13].C. elegansDAF-2 signaling, which is orthologous to insulin and insulin like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) in mammals, is also involved in metabolism and longevity but is negatively regulated by DAF-16/FOXO signaling [14]. Additionally, activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a conserved energy sensor in cells, extends lifespan ofC. elegans[15]. In addition to these major pathways and genes, ROS is also involved in regulating longevity [16]. High ROS activity has been shown to be a major lifespan limiting factor in humans,C. elegans, andDrosophila[7,17,18,19]. Finally, in addition to the factors discussed above, mitochondria regulate different signaling and metabolic pathways, including ROS production and therefore plays a vital role in aging progression [20]. Dietary intervention is one of the effective non-genetic or pharmacological means to combat aging [21]. Botanicals like cranberry, strawberry, blueberry, sweet cherry, tart cherry, and curcumin all contain biologically active polyphenols, which may protect against diseases and promote health in animals, humans, and model organisms [22,23,24]. Moreover, cranberry [8,13,25], mulberry [26], and blueberry anthocyanins increase lifespan ofC. elegansandDrosophilavia different pathways [17,27,28]. Out of these, Montmorency tart cherry (Prunus cerasus) contains high concentration of anthocyanin flavonoids, and its consumption is known to provide numerous health benefits by reducing inflammation and production of ROS [29,30] as well as protecting against diabetes [31], cardiovascular diseases [32], muscle pain [33], and cancer [34]. Tart cherry (TC) possess increased antioxidant activity both in vivo and in vitro [35]. However, the mechanisms by which TC reverses effects of aging through antioxidant activities have not been studied yet and remain to be further elucidated. To investigate the effects of TC extract (TCE) on aging and healthspan, we used the nematodeC. elegans, which is an excellent model for aging research [36] because of its short lifespan (2–3 weeks), experimental flexibility, and rapid turnover [37]. Furthermore,C. elegansbehavior and physiological activities slow down with age similar to that of higher mammals, including humans [27]. Additionally, 83% ofC. elegansproteome shows homology to the human proteome, and both humans and nematodes share significant age-related characteristics that can be used to study effects on health and aging [21,38]. In this paper, we determined mechanisms by which TCE extends lifespan inC. elegansusing microfluidic devices for whole-life culture studies that allow efficient drug delivery compared to animals reared on agar-plates [39,40,41]. We demonstrated that TCE extends lifespan and healthspan ofC. elegansby influencing the major DAF-16/FOXO lifespan regulating pathway. Consistent with this finding, TCE regulated upstream and downstream genes related to DAF-16 pathway, reduced the activity of genes related to ROS, and increased oxygen consumption rate. Therefore, our findings reveal protective anti-aging effects of TCE in vivo with robust translational potential in humans due to the feasibility of incorporating TCE into a typical human diet. 2.1. Preparation of Tart Cherry (TC) Extract Frozen TC (Cherry Marketing Institute, Dewitt, MI, USA) was ground using motor and pestle to obtain TC extract (TCE). Extracted cherry juice was filtered using 0.22 µm filter and stored in −80 °C until further use. Amounts of TCE used are based on anthocyanin concentration. We used TCE with doses between 0–12 µg anthocyanin per mL media. TCE extract from frozen TC contains 533 ± 47 µg/g total anthocyanin [29], and 1 µL TCE contains 3 µg of anthocyanins as measured by high performance liquid chromatography mass-spectrometry (HPLC-MS) [35,42,43]. Additionally, TCE contains other phenolics, melatonin, vitamins A/C/E/K, niacin, beta carotene, lutein + zeaxanthin, and pantothenic acid [29,44]. To prevent oxidation, thermal degradation, chemical and biochemical changes, extracted TC was aliquoted (20 µL) and stored in −80 °C [45]. Aliquots of TCE were thawed only once and not refrozen, and TCE was replaced every day to prevent oxidation [45]. 2.2. Strains and Growth Conditions Worms (wild type N2,daf-16,aak-2) (Vanapalli lab, TTU, Lubbock, TX, USA) were maintained on solid nematode growth medium for two successive generations, as previously described [46]. On the third day, age-synchronized young adults were used for analyses. At day 3, individual worms were suspended in liquid buffer (Nematode Growth Media (NGM)) and loaded into the micropillar chambers of a NemaLife microfluidic device using a syringe [40,41]. Each microfluidic device contained 30 individual chambers for animals to crawl, and one worm was loaded per chamber. Chambers were washed everyday with NGM to avoid progenies. Adult worms were fed with concentrated bacteria (100 mg/mL OP50) mixed with 3, 6, and 12 μg/mL TCE in the final mixture every day starting at day three until they all died. Chambers were rinsed everyday using liquid NGM media to wash out worm progenies and food was replenished. Worms were scored for survival every day. Worms killed during manipulation, wash errors, and bagging of worms exposed to contamination events were subsequently censored from analyses. At least three independent trials were performed for all conditions. Lifespan analyses were carried out using Kaplan–Meier statistical function using GraphPad Prism Version 7.04 software, with statistical significance considered atp< 0.05 using the log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test. Age synchronized worms ~500 µL was added into 60 mm plates. We estimated that each plate had approximately same number of worms ~1000 for RNA isolation. These N2 worms were grown in 3 mL of liquid axenic media for 7 days and then treated with or without tart cherry (6 µg/mL media, 12 µg/mL media) for 3 days, after which RNA was isolated using RNA isolation kit (Zymo Research Corp, Irvine, CA, USA) following manufacturers protocol. Same amount of total RNA was transcribed into cDNA using Maxima Reverse Transcription kit (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, CA, USA). Maxima powerup SYBRTMGreen Master Mix (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, CA, USA) was used for making cDNA to test targeted genes includingdaf-16,daf-2,daf-18,aak-2,akt-1,lin-14,skn-1,ucp-4,sod-2/3with18shousekeeping gene (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). 2.5. Mitochondrial Respiration Analysis Differences in gene expression and OCR were detected with a one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison test using GraphPad Prism 7.04, with statistical significance considered atp< 0.05. 3.1. Tart Cherry Extends Mean Lifespan of Wild Type N2 C. elegans in a Dose-Dependent Manner 3.2. Tart Cherry Effects on Genes Related to Aging Effects of tart cherry extracts (TCE) on mRNA levels of (a)daf-2, (b)daf-16, (c)daf-18, (d)akt-1, (e)lin-14, (f)skn-1, (g)ucp-4, (h)sod-2, (i)sod-3, and (j)aak-2. mRNA expression ofdaf-2,daf-16,daf-18,skn-1,ucp-4,sod-2,aak-2was significantly different with 6 and 12 μg/mL TCE worms compared to not treated (0 μg/mL) worms (different letters (a, b) are significantly different,p< 0.05, One-way ANOVA,n= 5, five independent experiments with triplicates). There is no significant difference in the mRNA levels ofakt,lin-14andsod-3in the 6 and 12 μg/mL treated worms compared to not treated worms (0 μg/mL). Synchronized worms (approx.n~ 1000) grown in the axenic media were treated with 0, 6, and 12 μg/mL TCE, and gene expression analysis was performed at day 10 after 3 days of treatment. 3.3. Effects of TCE on C. elegans Respiration Effects of tart cherry extracts (TCE) on respiration capacity inC. elegans. WT worms were treated with 0, 3, 6, and 12 μg/mL TCE. Sea-horse analysis was used to measure how they utilize oxygen. (a) Spare respiration was significantly higher (different letters (a, b) are significantly different,p< 0.05, one-way ANOVA, 20 worms/well in 4 replicates,n= 3 independent experiments) in 6 and 12 μg/mL TCE treated worms compared to 0 and 3 μg/mL treated worms. No difference was observed in (b) maximum respiration, (c) non-mitochondrial, or (d) mitochondrial respiration in TCE treated worms compared to non-treated worms. 3.4. TCE Did Not Extend Mean Lifespan in Daf-16 and Aak-2 Mutant Worms Studies have observed that bioactive compounds from various botanicals offer a variety of health benefits against obesity, cancer, inflammation, and age-related functional decline [23,35,52,53]. Here, we showed that Montmorency Tart Cherry is a potentially effective nutraceutical for promoting healthy aging inC. elegans. We showed that TCE consumption substantially extends lifespan mainly through IIS and DAF-16 signaling. We further confirmed these findings in mutant worms lacking functionaldaf-16andaak-2genes. TCE treatment did not extend the lifespan ofdaf-16andaak-2mutant worms. 4.1. TCE Increases Lifespan through IIS and DAF-16 Pathway IIS pathway modulates aging and longevity and highly conserved in invertebrates and mammals. Insulin like peptide (ILPs), an insulin/IGF-1 receptor (DAF-2), serine/threonine kinase (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isozyme 1 (PDK-1), AKT-1/2, AGE-1)/PI3K and FOXO transcription factor (DAF-16) are major components of the IIS transduction cascades [49]. Inactivation of DAF-16 transcription factor occurs after binding of ILPs to DAF-2, inhibiting the nuclear translocation of DAF-16 [57], which negatively regulates longevity. In addition to IIS signaling, many signaling pathways such as TOR, AMPK, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways are involved in aging [49,58]. Inhibition of TOR signaling increases lifespan ofC. elegansandDrosophilavia DAF-16 [8,59], CaMKII targets DAF-16 and modulates lifespan when worms are exposed to heat, hunger, or some other form of stressors [58], and JNK-1 signaling also regulates the activity of DAF-16 to promote lifespan post transcriptionally [60]. Very limited studies have tested effects of bioactive compounds in worms. Supplementation with wild blueberry juice (50, 100, and 200 mg/mL) increasedC. eleganslifespan through CaMKII pathway that mediates osmotic stress resistance [28]. Other studies using fresh blueberry (200 μg/mL) also showed increased lifespan and stress tolerance through DAF-16 [27], cranberry extract (2 mg/mL) [25] and anthocyanin-rich purple wheat extract (100 μg/mL) [56] increased lifespan inC. elegansvia the IIS/DAF-16 signaling pathway [13,25,56]. Further studies showed that oleanolic acid increased lifespan and stress tolerance through DAF-16 [61] while resveratrol, found in grape berry skin (100 μM), increased lifespan inC. elegansthrough sirtuin 2.1 (SIR 2.1), mammalian NAD-dependent protein deacetylase homology [62]. Moreover, blackberry extract increased antioxidant capacity in worms and provided protection against ROS generation [63]. In addition, a recently published study revealed that TCE acts as a calorie restriction mimetic and increased lifespan inC. elegans[54]. 4.2. Involvement of AMPK/AAK-2 in Lifespan Determination Interestingly, TCE did not increase the MLS ofaak-2mutant worms, indicating importance of this pathway in TCE-mediated longevity effects. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a fuel-sensing enzyme that negatively regulates fatty acid synthesis and positively regulates energy production pathways such as glycolysis and fatty acid β-oxidation [57]. Activation of AAK-2, homolog of AMPK inC. elegansphysiologically (dietary restriction) or pharmacologically (resveratrol or metformin), increased lifespan ofC. elegans[67].C. eleganshas bothaak-1andaak-2, two different genes. The AMPKα1 subunit inC. elegans, AAK-2, is activated by AMP and involved in longevity [51]. By contrast, AMPKα2 subunit, AAK-2, inC. elegansis not involved in longevity effects suggesting that AAK-2 is the subunit with kinase activity [67]. Because of that, here, we evaluated the effects of TCE inaak-2worm lifespan andaak-2gene expression in WT worms. TCE did not change the MLS ofaak-2worms treated with TCE. Previous studies reported thataak-2(ok524) mutants have a shorter lifespan (12%) than WT worms [51]. In contrast to these findings, however,aak-2(rb754) mutant worms we used for our lifespan assays did not show shorter average lifespan than WT worms, andaak-2(rb754) had 17.8% increased lifespan than WT worms. The above reported study has been conducted on agar plates, while we used microfluidic devices for the lifespan assay and fed worms everyday with liquid OP50 mixed with TCE. Changes of the environment, use of microfluidic devices, and differences in theaak-2strains used might be a potential cause for these discrepancies. Further genetic analysis in WT worms showed increased expression ofaak-2gene with TCE treatments. Possibly, activation ofaak-2increased fatty acid oxidation in WT worms, which may change total fatty acid composition in the worms and indirectly influence the lifespan of WT worms. However, these changes were not taking place in mutantaak2, which may affect their responses to TCE and changes in fatty acid composition or lipid metabolism. These findings suggest that TCE acts partly through AAK-2 pathway and requires DAF-16 and IIS pathways to increase lifespan inC. elegans. Sirtuins-1 (Sirt-1), an ortholog of mammalian yeast deacetylaseSir-2linked to IIS signaling pathway [12], may also be involved in lifespan regulation and merits further investigation. 4.3. Role of Mitochondria in Lifespan Determination Mitochondria plays an important role in overall cellular and organism health. Mitochondria are involved in cellular metabolism, apoptosis, and production of ROS [60]. It is thought that impaired mitochondria produce more ROS which causes cellular damage and leads to aging [68,69]. SOD is an enzyme that is involved in detoxification [16,70] and is found in cytoplasm, nucleus, and mitochondria [71]. Experiments in yeast and mice showed that knocking outsod-1andsod-2decreased lifespan [72,73]. In contrast, another study reported that SOD has no effect on lifespan inC. elegans[16]. In our current study,sod-2gene levels were increased with TCE, with no changes insod-3gene expression. Another study using purple pitanga fruit showed increasedsod-3protein expression inC. elegans[19]. We chosesod-3oversod-1as they share some genetic similarities and have a certain level of amino acid homology, andsod-2does not share substantial amino acid homology with eithersod-1orsod-3[74]. Possibly, increasedsod-2gene expression in our study decreased mitochondrial ROS activity and extended lifespan. However, these findings remain to be confirmed usingsod-2mutant worms. Furthermore, to validate effects of TCE on ROS production, we plan in future to conduct additional functional assays to measure ROS, GSH/SG, and MDA levels. Ideal mitochondrial function is critical to have healthy cellular activity, and mitochondrial respiration is a strong indicator of good mitochondrial function [75]. An age-related decline in oxidative phosphorylation can relate to reduced mitochondrial and nuclear expressed peptides functioning in the electron transport chain (ETC) [76]. Mitochondrial health can be measured by the rate of mitochondrial respiration in ETC [77,78]. Moreover, alterations in the oxygen consumption rate are an indicator of mitochondrial dysfunction [79]. Moreover, decreased mitochondrial function reduces sufficient energy production, which plays key role during aging [80]. In order to quantify the function of mitochondria, we assessed mitochondrial OCR by TCE treatments in WTC. elegans. Our data showed that TCE treated adult worms have significantly higher spare respiration capacity with 6 and 12 μg/mL concentrations. Spare respiratory capacity is the amount of additional ATP produced by oxidative phosphorylation as a result of sudden increase in energy demand [76]. Based on our findings, it is possible that increased expression of antioxidant genes, led to increased mitochondrial spare respiration by reducing ROS production and oxidative stress in part throughsod-2. Another indicator of mitochondrial function is uncoupling proteins (UCPs).C. elegansexpressesucp-4. UCPs are highly conserved in many species, such as invertebrates, plants, and mammals. UCP-1 in mammals is induced by cold temperature and is a major player in thermogenesis and energy expenditure [81]. Mammals express several other UCPs, which are involved in different functions other than thermogenesis. It is reported that non-thermogenic UCPs protect cells against oxidative stress [82]. In support of these ideas, knocking downucp-2gene in mice generated more ROS than WT mice [83], and knocking downucp-3gene led to more ROS production in skeletal muscle [84]. UCP-like protein inC. elegansis thoroughly related toucp-4in mammals, and the two proteins share 46% sequence identity [85]. Here, we found that expression ofucp-4was significantly higher in worms treated with 6 and 12 μg/mL TCE. Several studies documented thatucp-4mutants may be involved in increased neuronal defects during aging [68,86], but none of the studies have reported lifespan extension effects ofucp-4by reducing mitochondrial ROS production. Our findings suggest that reduced ROS production and increased mitochondrial function by TCE may be governed partially by increaseducp-4expression. Major molecular targets for TCE inC. elegans. TCE downregulateddaf-2gene and up-regulateddaf-16,daf-18,skn-1,sod-2,ucp-4, andaak-2while no changes were observed inakt-1orlin-14genes. These molecules may be indirectly involved in regulating mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, ant-oxidant activity, and fatty acid metabolism, and this may subsequently increase lifespan ofC. elegans. Downregulated genes are shown in red; up-regulated genes are shown in blue, and those genes that were not changed by TCE are shown in green. Dotted arrows show potential indirect targets of TCE.
