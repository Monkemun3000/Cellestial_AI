Space is a hostile environment, and human space travel will entail effects at many levels of biological organization leading to related physiological effects. One of the major environmental factors in space is radiation. Ionizing radiation in space is composed of a complex mixture of particles including protons from the sun and galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) originating from outside the solar system. The GCR is composed of atomic nuclei, including a component of heavy charged and energetic (HZE) particles that are relatively few in number but highly ionizing. A major risk-factor for human spaceflight is exposure GCR HZE that can cause DNA damage that is unrepaired or mis-repaired [1]. Current research has shown measurable impact on in several areas affecting human health bone loss [2], skeletal muscle atrophy [3,4,5], reproductive hazards in women and men [6], cognitive/behavioral changes [7], central nervous system (CNS) decrements [8,9], and changes in cardiovascular physiology [10]. The possibility that space radiation exposure to increase cardiovascular disease risk requires additional validation similar to the ongoing observations of increased cardiac impairment observed in radiotherapy-treated cancer survivors [11,12]. Spaceflight has also been shown to have an impact on established cancer hallmarks [13], possibly increasing carcinogenic risk [14]. A substantial amount of work has also been generated in the area of omics. For several decades, omics animal-based studies have been performed to understand the human health risks due to spaceflight missions using the International Space Station, the space shuttle, biosatellites, and ground-based experiments. NASA’s growing GeneLab omics database now hosts almost 250 experimental studies on spaceflight exposure and analogous ground-based experiments from microbes, plants, animal models, and human/animal-derived cell cultures [23]. These data are available as an open-access resource for single- and multi-omic analyses on microarray, RNA-sequencing, bisulfite-sequencing, proteomic, metabolomic, and metagenomic datasets. Although these data are targeted to better understand the risks associated with human spaceflight, these experiments also demonstrate a unique stress that provides a better understanding of adverse human health effects due to alterations in cellular behavior owing to factors such as microgravity, altered carbon dioxide levels, psychological stressors, and damaging ionizing radiation exposures from GCR and protons in the Earth’s radiation belts. These datasets, and in particular the in vivo animal models used, present a unique experimental setting to study the cellular and host-level interactions that impact human health. Summary of the NASA GeneLab datasets for samples exposed to cosmic radiation during spaceflight or analogous ground-based radiation experiments curated for analysis. * LEO: low Earth orbit radiation for flight experiments is due to a combination of cosmic radiation (protons, galactic cosmic rays (GCR), and heavier ions) as well as protons trapped in Earth radiation belts. 2.1. Changes in RNA-Specific Error Rates Comparing Spaceflight Versus Ground Control Samples RNA-sequencing error rates in mouse livers from GLDS-168 (left column) and GLDS-242 (right column) experiments for spaceflight (black bars) compared to ground control samples (white bars). Error rates were examined as follows: (A,B) mismatch rates across chromosomes normalized by the number of bases sequenced; (C,D) single base substitution rates; (E,F) CAC, CGT, GTA, or GTG error rates. Significance indicated by *p-value < 0.05 and **p-value < 0.01. 2.2. Comparison of Multiple Genelab Datasets Using Principal Component Analysis The number of statistically significant gene sets from gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) with a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 for each dataset for the major molecular signatures database collections (i.e., C5, C2, and C6). The black bars represent the unaltered genes and the white bars represent the annotated gene sets. Principal component analysis (PCA) plots on GLDS datasets using the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) nominal enrichment scores before (top row) and after (bottom row) auto-annotation using Cytoscape’s enrichment map software. GSEA gene sets used were as follows: (A,B) C5 Gene Ontology (GO) terms, (C,D) C2 curated terms, and (E,F) C6 oncogenic signature terms. Each data point is represented by experimental radiation dose (color) or radiation type (shape). Heatmaps on all gene sets and also annotated gene sets for each molecular signature database collection. Euclidean clustering was used for clustering the rows and columns. 2.3. Transcriptome Evaluation of Biological Functions Impacted by Spaceflight Exposure in Animal Models To observe the impact of radiation exposure, transcriptional data from experiments spanning 1 to 1000 mGy doses in animal models and cell cultures were examined for alteration in multiple biological pathways. This analysis combined statistically significant biological pathways that resulted from GSEA analysis for each individual dataset [54]. This included the following three major molecular signatures database collections: (1) the Gene Ontology (GO; C5) gene sets from biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions; (2) the curated dataset (C2) gene sets from chemical and genetic perturbations and canonical pathways such as the BioCarta, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), Pathway Interaction Database (PID), and Reactome pathway databases; and (3) the oncogenic signatures (C6) gene sets representing major pathways altered in cancer. Analysis of all GeneLab datasets utilized for direct comparisons with Gene Ontology (GO) GSEA analysis. (A) Auto-annotated GO GSEA terms from Cytoscape’s enrichment mapper. Each node represents one specific GO term with each wedge representing one GeneLab datasets utilized for this manuscript. The yellow circles represent the auto-annotated go terms with common related pathways. (B) Heatmap withk-means clustering for the specific GO pathways. Six specific pathways were found to be clustered together throughk-means clustering. (C) Scatter plots comparing the normalized enrichment scores (NES) to dose in milligrays and fitting with a generalized additive model (GAM) on each cluster (represented in (C)). Each panel represents one of the clusters and the color-coded lines represent GAM fits performed on each GO-annotated term in the cluster. The circles in the plots represent the gene sets and the pink shade around the GAM fits represent the standard error. Analysis of all GeneLab datasets utilized for direct comparisons with the GSEA C2 curated collection analysis. (A) Auto-annotated C2 GSEA terms from Cytoscape’s enrichment mapper. Each node represents one specific C2 term with each wedge representing one GeneLab dataset utilized for this manuscript. The yellow circles represent the auto-annotated GO terms with common related pathways. (B) Heatmap withk-means clustering for the specific C2 pathways. A total of 15 specific pathways were found to be clustered together throughk-means clustering. (C) Scatter plots comparing the normalized enrichment scores (NES) to dose in mGy and fits with a generalized additive model (GAM) on each cluster (represented in (B)). Each panel represents one of the clusters and the color-coded lines represent GAM fits performed on each C2-annotated term in the cluster. The circles in the plots represent the gene sets and the pink shade around the GAM fits represent the standard error. Lastly, less stringent statistics with an FDR < 0.05 in only three of the GeneLab Datasets was also analyzed for C2 gene sets (Figures S10–S17). Like the C5 analysis, more gene sets were clustered per group afterk-means clustering (Figure S10), leading to three clusters requiring additionalk-means sub-clustering analysis (Figures S11–S13). This less statistically stringent analysis on C2 produced additional trends through the GAM fits that were not observed in the more conservative analysis (Figures S14–S17). A clear decrease in TNF pathways was observed with increasing dose (Figure S16), and a novel pathway related to taste transduction was observed as increasing with dose (Figure S17). Interestingly, it has been reported that both olfactory pathways and taste are altered in astronauts, which was previously thought to be due to fluid shifts in the head caused by microgravity conditions [65,66,67]. These data also indicate that space radiation may have some impact on this interesting phenomenon. 2.3.3. GSEA C6: Oncogenic Signatures Analysis of all GeneLab datasets utilized for direct comparisons with the GSEA C6 oncology signature collection analysis. (A) Auto-annotated C6 GSEA terms from Cytoscape’s enrichment mapper. Each node represents one specific C6 term with each wedge representing one GeneLab dataset utilized for this manuscript. The yellow circles represent the auto-annotated GO terms with common related pathways. (B) Heatmap withk-means clustering for the specific C6 pathways. Five specific pathways were found to be clustered together throughk-means clustering. (C) Scatter plots comparing the normalized enrichment scores (NES) to dose in milligrays and fits with a generalized additive model (GAM) on each cluster (represented in (B)). Each panel represents one of the clusters and the color-coded lines represent GAM fits performed on each C6-annotated term in the cluster. The circles in the plots represent the gene sets and the pink shade around the GAM fits represent the standard error. Analysis of all GeneLab datasets utilized for direct comparisons with the GSEA C6 oncology signature collection analysis. Scatter plots comparing the normalized enrichment scores (NES) to dose in milligrays and fits with a generalized additive model (GAM) on specific C6 oncogenes. Each panel represents one specific oncogene and the color-coded lines represent GAM fits performed on the multiple C6 pathways associated with that oncogene. The circles in the plots represent the gene sets and the pink shade around the GAM fits represent the standard error. 2.4. Common Genes as a Function of Dose and Association with Biological Pathways Common genes across all datasets. (A) Log2 fold-change with respect to dose for a subset of 9 genes that appeared across all 19 spaceflight studies and 3 ground studies. A polynomial of degree 2 was fit to each dose response in the range 1–1000 mGy. (B) Log2 fold-change with respect to dose for a subset of nine genes that appeared across spaceflight studies in the range 1–30 mGy. A polynomial of degree 1 was fit to each dose response. (C) Log2 fold-change with respect to dose for a subset of nine genes that appeared across all eight spaceflight studies specifically related to the muscle tissues. A polynomial of degree 1 was fit to each dose response in the range 1–30 mGy. The dashed lines denote the +/-1 sigma errors on the fitted polynomials. (D) The functional impact of the nine common genes determined by ToppCluster [70] and displayed using Cytoscape. Here, we presented a novel approach in using publicly available transcriptomic data to determine potential health risks and dysregulation of biological pathways as a function of space radiation exposure. The use of NASA’s GeneLab platform [23] allowed us to mine data that might not have otherwise been possible to obtain from individual experimental datasets. The large number of radiation datasets available through this platform allowed the creative combination of different datasets from former experiments to generate new hypotheses [71]. These observed trends as a function of space radiation exposure revealed unique pathways that seem to be specifically related to GCR, whereas some pathways from our analysis are known to be universal responses to radiation. The mechanisms of damage are common to highly ionizing radiation regardless of the source [94]; what is unique to chronic space radiation exposure is the combination of highly ionizing particles, low dose, and a low dose rate, which may have implications for DNA repair [17], mitochondrial pathways [16], and lipid pathways [42] as just a few examples of what emerged from our analysis. In addition, we found specific cancer-related pathways that may be unique to space radiation. For example, decreases in TGFβ [32], embryonic stem cells (ESC) [95], and VEGFa seem to be unique to space radiation. Spaceflight studies have previously revealed a plethora of effects that radiation can have at individual doses or over a small range of discreet doses. However, the pooling and meta-analysis of these datasets in this study allowed for a unique visualization and comparison over a larger range of radiation doses. This in turn made it possible to identify trends in physiological response from low to high doses and provided insight into the response to accumulating doses that may occur in long duration space missions or over a few days during solar particle events. This technique may also be utilized to determine potential targets for therapeutic intervention. For example, because we report that mitochondrial pathways decrease as a function of space radiation, this argues for additional validation and research on specific mitochondrial targets for countermeasure development. In addition, from this analysis we can extrapolate to specific doses that may pose greater health risks. This analysis can only be done by utilizing a large number of datasets that are available from platforms such as NASA’s GeneLab. The resolution obtained from this analysis can easily be lost once we lower the number datasets that will be used. Our analysis has indicated several different health risks that may occur with increasing exposure to space radiation. Through an unbiased technique purely driven by statistics and utilizing a large amount of transcriptomic data from NASA’s GeneLab platform, we were able to identify tissue-independent biological pathways that are dysregulated as a function of space radiation dose. We believe this technique can further be used with other datasets and databases to generate more hypotheses that will assist with determining optimal therapeutic countermeasures and targets that can mitigate space radiation response in humans. 4.1. Chromosomal and Subsitution Error Rate Mapping Two mouse liver RNA-sequencing datasets (GLDS-168 and GLDS-242) from NASA spaceflight experiments were specifically analyzed for chromosomal or substitution error rates. Compressed fastq files were cleaned using TRIM galore (v0.6.4,https://github.com/FelixKrueger/TrimGalore/blob/master/Docs/Trim_Galore_User_Guide.md) to remove adapters and bases falling below a Q20 Phred quality score. Paired reads were aligned to the mouse mm10 reference genome using bowtie2 (v2.3.4.1,) and the output piped through samtools to generate a bam file. The bam file had read group information added and was coordinate sorted using Picard tools (v2.21.3,). Mapping metrics were calculated using Picard tools and final mismatches (MN flag) extracted with genomic coordinates using Bedtools (v2.26.0,https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Data were analyzed in R to determine the frequency of mismatches with respect to chromosome number and plotted. Mapping quality data from Picard tools was analyzed using GraphpadPrism (v7.0, GraphPad Software, La Jolla California USA). 4.2. Bioinformatics, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, and Visulization Using Cytoscape 4.3. Principal Component Analysis, t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding, k-Means Clustering, Heatmaps, and Generalized Additive Model Fits 4.4. Analysis on Common Individual Genes with Fold-Change Values and Fits as a Function of Dose This work is an example of how GeneLab’s rich database of omics experiments with animal models can be exploited to better understand the effects of ionizing radiation and the resulting potential risks to humans. This large-scale analysis of multiple transcriptome datasets including RNA-sequencing and microarray datasets provides a valuable examination of dose-dependent perturbations of cellular function across multiple tissue types in animal models. Individually, these experiments were limited by flight duration, resulting in a single accumulated dose from a micture of particles or, in ground-based studies, exposure to a single particle species. When analyzing multiple molecular databases using our approach to many omics datasets, a more comprehensive analysis of significantly impacted biological factors can be obtained than was previously possible.
