A forward-genetic screen for Arabidopsis mutants hypersensitive to latrunculin B identifies HLB1 as a plant-specific protein that functions in post-Golgi traffic. The endomembrane system plays essential roles in plant development, but the proteome responsible for its function and organization remains largely uncharacterized in plants. Here, we identified and characterized the HYPERSENSITIVE TO LATRUNCULIN B1 (HLB1) protein isolated through a forward-genetic screen inArabidopsis thalianafor mutants with heightened sensitivity to actin-disrupting drugs. HLB1 is a plant-specific tetratricopeptide repeat domain-containing protein of unknown function encoded by a single Arabidopsis gene. HLB1 associated with thetrans-Golgi network (TGN)/early endosome (EE) and tracked along filamentous actin, indicating that it could link post-Golgi traffic with the actin cytoskeleton in plants. HLB1 was found to interact with the ADP-ribosylation-factor guanine nucleotide exchange factor, MIN7/BEN1 (HOPM INTERACTOR7/BREFELDIN A-VISUALIZED ENDOCYTIC TRAFFICKING DEFECTIVE1) by coimmunoprecipitation. Themin7/ben1mutant phenocopied the mild root developmental defects and latrunculin B hypersensitivity ofhlb1, and analyses of ahlb1/ min7/ben1double mutant showed thathlb1andmin7/ben1operate in common genetic pathways. Based on these data, we propose that HLB1 together with MIN7/BEN1 form a complex with actin to modulate the function of theTGN/EEat the intersection of the exocytic and endocytic pathways in plants. Normal plant development relies on the endomembrane system as it plays a central role in directing the delivery of enzyme complexes and polysaccharide precursors to the cell surface and to the vacuole (Kim and Brandizzi, 2014;Kim et al., 2015). In addition, protein traffic through endomembranes is pivotal for specifying how plants respond and adapt to a range of biotic and abiotic stresses (Chen et al., 2008;Lozano‐Durán et al., 2014;Garcia de la Garma et al., 2015). The endomembrane system is highly dynamic and consists of a network of functionally interconnected organelles beginning with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where proteins are synthesized and then trafficked to the plasma membrane (PM) and vacuole after processing and sorting in the Golgi apparatus and post-Golgi organelles (Richter et al., 2009;Brandizzi and Barlowe, 2013). Recycling and degradation ofPMproteins, which also are facilitated by the endomembrane trafficking machinery, are essential for establishing and maintaining the polar localization of lipids and critical proteins, including auxin carriers, transmembrane receptors, channels, and ion transporters that regulate diverse physiological processes in plants (Geldner et al., 2007;Takano et al., 2010;Barberon and Geldner, 2014;Hachez et al., 2014;Doyle et al., 2015). Among the various organelles that comprise the endomembrane system, thetrans-Golgi network (TGN) is arguably the most mysterious. The complexity ofTGNfunction stems from the fact that it lies at the intersection of secretory and endocytic pathways, through which cargo destined for thePMand vacuole transit (Contento and Bassham, 2012;Gendre et al., 2015). In contrast to mammalian cells, there is mounting evidence that theTGNin plants functions as an early endosome (EE) that directly receives cargo taken up via endocytosis for recycling back to thePMor directed to the vacuole for degradation (Dettmer et al., 2006;Viotti et al., 2010). In recent years, much has been learned about the structure and dynamics of the plantTGN. Using transmission electron tomography on high-pressure frozenArabidopsis thalianaroots, for example, it was shown that the formation of theTGNoccurs through distinct structural changes including separation oftrans-most Golgi cisterna via a peeling mechanism and secretory vesicle budding from the plane of the originaltrans-Golgi cisterna (Kang et al., 2011). In another study, live-cell spinning-disc confocal microscopy of Arabidopsis hypocotyl cells uncovered the formation of thin tube-like protrusions connecting twoTGN/EEunits prior to their homotypic fusion (Viotti et al., 2010). Furthermore, live-cell super-resolution microscopy described two types ofTGNin Arabidopsis roots: a Golgi-associatedTGNon thetrans-side of the Golgi apparatus and a Golgi-independentTGNthat moved independently of Golgi bodies (Uemura et al., 2014). In addition to new knowledge about its structure and dynamics, several protein components of the plantTGNhave been discovered that mediate crucial aspects of post-Golgi membrane traffic and maintainTGNintegrity. TheseTGNresident proteins include solubleN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors, the so-called SYNTAXINS of PLANTS (SYPs), vacuolar H+-ATPases, adaptor protein complexes, small monomeric GTPases of the ADP ribosylation factor (ARF) and RAS genes from rat brain (RAB) families, and the ECHIDNA/YPT/RAB GTPase complex (Dettmer et al., 2006;Chow et al., 2008;Zouhar et al., 2009;Gendre et al., 2011, 2013;Uemura et al., 2012;Asaoka et al., 2013;Naramoto et al., 2014). Whereas many of the plantTGN-localized proteins are evolutionarily conserved in eukaryotes, some appear to be unique to the plant post-Golgi trafficking machinery (Ebine et al., 2008,2011;Fujimoto and Ueda, 2012), and it is likely that more factors remain uncharacterized. Mobility of organelles within the cell is typically driven by the cytoskeleton, a network of filamentous proteins that consists of microtubules, microfilaments, and intermediate filaments. Microfilaments, also known as filamentous actin (F-actin), assemble in an energy-dependent manner from monomeric globular actin (G-actin) units to form two-stranded, helical structures that are ∼5 to 7 nm in diameter (Li et al., 2014). The higher order organization of the actin cytoskeleton consists mostly of bundles and cables, and their assembly into these structures is specified by several actin binding proteins such as fimbrin, villin, profilin, LIM domain-containing proteins, thrumin, and crolin (Papuga et al., 2010;Whippo et al., 2011;Su et al., 2012;Jia et al., 2013;Qu et al., 2013;Sun et al., 2013). The movement and dynamics of theERand the various organelles that make up the plant endomembrane system are largely dependent on the actin cytoskeleton, as demonstrated using actin-disrupting drugs such as latrunculin B (LatB) and cytochalasin D (Boevink et al., 1998;Nebenführ et al., 1999;Sparkes et al., 2009). However, actin appears to be dispensable for protein transport between theERand Golgi apparatus (Brandizzi et al., 2002). While it was shown that cargo traffic from the Golgi to the vacuoles requires an intact actin cytoskeleton, the underlying mechanisms by which this process is accomplished are unknown (Kim et al., 2005). There is a wealth of information on the relationship between post-Golgi traffic and its mediation by the actin cytoskeleton in yeast and animal cells. Most of the evidence to date in these systems has pointed toward a pivotal role for F-actin and its associated regulatory and motor proteins in post-Golgi vesicle biogenesis and membrane deformation (Anitei and Hoflack, 2012). In mammalian HeLa cells, for example, myosin 1b was shown to generate the forces that regulate the assembly of F-actin foci for tubule formation at theTGN(Almeida et al., 2011). In another class of mammalian cells called 3T3, the actin-related protein 2/3 (ARP2/3) complex and their activators in the WASP (Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein) family drive the nucleation of F-actin on endosomes, which is necessary to promote endosome fission (Derivery et al., 2009). Recently, a combination of elegant optical tweezer and live-cell confocal imaging in human epithelial cells demonstrated that the actin cytoskeleton confers rigidity to the Golgi complex, making it stiffer than the surrounding cytoplasm. It was proposed that mechanical stress imposed by actin affects membrane budding and fission during intra-Golgi transport (Guet et al., 2014). In plants, several actin binding proteins appear to link actin dynamics with membrane trafficking. Many of these proteins, such as the ARP2/3 complex, profilin, formins, and capping proteins, which localize to thePMand various membranes of organelles within the endomembrane system, have orthologs in other eukaryotes (Zhang et al., 2010,2013;Sun et al., 2013;Jimenez-Lopez et al., 2014;Cvrčková et al., 2015). In fact, some of the mechanisms by which F-actin on membranes is nucleated and polymerized in plants mirror those of animals and yeast, where small GTPases of the Rho family directly activate membrane-localized actin nucleators (Takenawa and Suetsugu, 2007). For example, genetic and biochemical studies in Arabidopsis showed that a Rho of plants (ROP)-guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) protein called SPIKE1 regulates F-actin polymerization through the ARP2/3 complex (Basu et al., 2008;Zhang et al., 2010). Recently, a number of plant-specific proteins that function as actin membrane adaptors have been uncovered. One example is RISAP, aTGN-localized ROP-GTPase effector that interacts with F-actin and binds to the globular tail domain of myosin XI in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) pollen tubes. RISAP is ∼33% identical to the Arabidopsis family of myosin binding proteins at the amino acid level (Peremyslov et al., 2013). It was proposed that the RISAP-mediated interaction between the actin cytoskeleton and endomembrane system is an essential component of the tip growth machinery in pollen tubes (Stephan et al., 2014). Another family of plant-specific proteins that mediate actin-endomembrane crosstalk is the 13-member Networked (NET) proteins. These NET proteins interacted directly with F-actin through a conserved N-terminal domain. The NET proteins were also shown to localize toPM-ERcontact sites and the tonoplast (Deeks et al., 2012;Wang et al., 2014). Here, we report the discovery of a plant-specific protein called HLB1 (for HYPERSENSITIVE TO LATRUNCULIN B1) through a forward-genetic screen in Arabidopsis seedlings for mutants that exhibited differential responses to the inhibitory effects ofLatBon primary root growth. We determined that HLB1 tracks along F-actin and colocalizes with theTGN/EEin vivo and thathlb1has marked defects in the recycling of proteins to thePMafter endocytic uptake. Furthermore, we identified the ARF-GEF, MIN7/BEN1 (Nomura et al., 2006;Tanaka et al., 2009), as an HLB1 interactor and showed thathlb1functions in a common genetic pathway asmin7/ben1in regard toLatBhypersensitivity despite their opposite effects on membrane trafficking. These findings are significant because they support the conclusion that HLB1 represents a class of plant-specific proteins that function at the crossroads of exocytic and endocytic trafficking pathways, possibly through mechanisms coordinated by the actin cytoskeleton.

Dark-green shading depicts identical amino acid residues. Light green indicates other conserved residues. Including HLB1, the Arabidopsis genome has 147 proteins containing a total of 839TPRmotifs that are predicted to function in a range of biological processes and localize to a variety of subcellular compartments (Supplemental Data Set 1). However, HLB1 has no paralogs among any of the 146TPRmotif-containing Arabidopsis proteins, indicating that it exists as a single gene. Furthermore, HLB1 is specific to land plants, as no homologous sequences were identified in fungi and animals.TPRdomains mediate protein-protein interactions, and proteins containing these domains are part of protein complexes with diverse functions including transcriptional repression, protein import, heat shock, and cell cycle regulation (Blatch and Lässle, 1999;D’Andrea and Regan, 2003).TPRdomain-containing proteins in plants have been implicated in responses to various hormones, assembly of the photosynthetic machinery, plastid partitioning, and root development (Jacobsen et al., 1996;Rosado et al., 2006;Yang et al., 2011;Hu et al., 2014;Bhuiyan et al., 2015).

Confocal microscopy of cells from the elongation zone and root hairs ofhlb1-1seedlings expressingHLB1pro:HLB1-GFPrevealed that the fusion protein localized to the cytoplasm and decorated distinct and dynamic foci (Figures 6Cand6D;Supplemental Movie 4). The fluorescent bodies decorated by HLB1-GFP were reminiscent of those observed in plant cells expressing fluorescently tagged compartments of the endomembrane system (Geldner et al., 2009). Endomembrane compartments such as endosomes visualized with GFP have been shown to form large intracellular fluorescent agglomerates when treated with the fungal metabolite Brefeldin A (BFA) (Robinson et al., 2008). Consistent with the hypothesis that the HLB1-GFP bodies were associated with the endomembrane system, seedlings expressingHLB1pro:HLB1-GFPtreated with 50 μMBFAfor 1 h developed intracellular fluorescent agglomerates (Figures 6Eand6F).

Different letters are significantly different (P < 0.05, Tukey’s test). HLB1-GFP Bodies Track along F-Actin in Planta Given that thehlb1mutant is hypersensitive toLatB, we tested the association of HLB1-GFP TGNs with F-actin in planta. HLB1-GFP plants were crossed with plants expressing the red fluorescent F-actin constructUBQ10pro:mCherry-ABD2-mCherry(Dyachok et al., 2014). It was difficult to obtain clear images of mCherry-ABD2-mCherry and HLB1-GFP bodies together in root cells that were highly cytoplasmic because the HLB1-GFP cytoplasmic component would often obscure the red F-actin label. Thus, imaging of mCherry-ABD2-mCherry and HLB1-GFP was conducted on vacuolated epidermal cells of the root maturation zone and fully mature root hairs, where signal from the cytoplasm was minimal. In these cell types, HLB1-GFP bodies aligned with and tracked along F-actin bundles in a “beads-on-a-string”-like localization, typical of actin membrane adaptors such as the NET proteins, which are associated with the actin cytoskeleton in vivo (Figures 8Aand8B;Supplemental Movies 9 and 10) (Wang et al., 2014).

(F)SEC-RFP in epidermal cells from cotyledons of 5-d-old seedlings. SEC-RFP is detected in the apoplast of the wild type andhlb1but appears to be retained strongly in theER(arrows) inhlb1.

(H)Mis-sorting of RFP-AFVY was quantified by dividing the average fluorescence intensity of the apoplast by the average fluorescence intensity of the vacuole as indicated by the white rectangles in(G). A higher ratio indicates strong RFP-AFVY accumulation in the apoplast. Values are means (n= 38 to 43 cells from 15 independent seedlings) ±se(ttest, ***P < 0.0001). Because conspicuous differences between the wild type andhlb1were noted with regard to PIN2-GFP intensity in thePMand cell interior (Figures 11Aand11B), we next asked ifhlb1displayed anypin2-like phenotypes in regard to seedling root development. Consistent with previous reports,pin2seedlings had distinct root agravitropic defects as evident from their high deviation from vertical growth (Müller et al., 1998). By contrast, the deviation from vertical growth ofhlb1roots was similar to the wild type (Supplemental Figures 15A and 15B). Moreover, although the deviation from vertical growth ofpin2roots appeared to be enhanced byLatB, their primary roots exhibited wild-type growth sensitivity toLatB(Supplemental Figures 15C and 15D). Root deviation from vertical growth ofben1andhlb1 ben1was similar tohlb1and the wild type (Supplemental Figures 15A and 15B). These data indicate that the HLB1-MIN7/BEN1-residentTGNcomplex is not required for full functionality of PIN2. Because PIN2 recycling is defective inhlb1and post-Golgi traffic of some PIN proteins is a crucial component of the root gravitropic response (Kleine-Vehn et al., 2008;Kleine-Vehn et al., 2010), we next asked whetherhlb1roots were compromised in gravitropism. Seedlings of the wild type andhlb1with roots growing vertically were rotated by 90 degrees, and the kinetics of root curvature was monitored at various time points for a 12-h period. No measureable differences in root gravitropic response between wild-type andhlb1seedlings under our growth conditions were noted (Supplemental Figures 15E and 15F). hlb1Has Partial Defects in Bulk Flow Secretion and Trafficking to the Vacuole Genetic Interaction Studies Indicate thathlb1andben1Function in Common Root Developmental Pathways despite Opposite Effects on Membrane Trafficking (A)to(D)Intracellular accumulation of the styryl dye FM 1-43 is altered inben1andhlb1 ben1but not in the wild type orhlb1.

(E)Quantification of FM1-43 agglomerates in root cells after treatment withBFAfor 1 h. Statistical significance was determined by one-way ANOVA. Values are means (n> 200 cells) ±sefrom at least 20 independent seedlings. Different letters indicate significant differences among means (P < 0.05; Tukey’s test). (F)Growth ofben1andhlb1 ben1seedlings is more sensitive to 5 μMBFAcompared with the wild type andhlb1. Bar = 5 mm. (G)Quantification of primary root growth (expressed as percent of controls) of the wild type,hlb1,ben1, andhlb1 ben1in 5 μMBFA. Statistical significance was determined by one-way ANOVA. Values are means (n= 18 to 32 roots) ±se. Different letters indicate significant differences among means (P < 0.05; Tukey’s test). Another phenotype reported forben1seedlings is their hypersensitivity to growth on moderate concentrations ofBFA(Tanaka et al., 2009). Given that bothben1andhlb1phenocopied each other in regard to root development and hypersensitivity toLatB, the response ofhlb1toBFAwas examined. Consistent with previous reports,ben1seedlings displayed heightened sensitivity to low doses ofBFAcompared with the wild type. By contrast,hlb1seedlings showed wild-type sensitivity toBFA. Furthermore, seedlings of thehlb1 ben1double mutant displayed similar hypersensitivity toBFAcompared to seedlings ofben1single mutants, providing additional genetic evidence thatben1functions upstream ofhlb1(Figures 12Fand12G). HLB1 Is a Component of the Plant Post-Golgi Trafficking Machinery Our work experimentally demonstrates that aTPRdomain protein, namely, HLB1, is localized to post-Golgi compartments. OtherTPRdomain-containing proteins among the 147 in Arabidopsis, including SHORT AND SWOLLEN ROOT1 and MET1, localize to mitochondria and chloroplasts, respectively, consistent with their functions in oxidative stress-mediated root development and in the assembly of the photosynthetic apparatus (Bhuiyan et al., 2015;Zhang et al., 2015). TheTPRprotein CLUMPED CHLOROPLAST1 (CLMP1) localizes to distinct foci in the cytoplasm. Although the exact identity of the CLMP1 foci remains unknown, their adjacent location to chloroplasts supports their role in plastid partitioning and distribution (Yang et al., 2011). Here, we show that theTGN/EE-localized HLB1 protein functions in the recycling of proteins and other lipophilic cargo from post-Golgi compartments to thePMafter their uptake by endocytosis. This conclusion is supported by the observation thatBFA-induced PIN2-GFP and FM1-43 agglomerates persisted inhlb1mutants afterBFAwashout. hlb1also had partial defects in constitutive secretion, which were most apparent in cells of young seedlings including root hairs and epidermal pavement cells of cotyledons. In this regard,LatBtreatment was previously shown to alter the tip localization of theTGN-localized secretory marker YFP-RabA4B in growing root hairs (Preuss et al., 2004). The disrupted gradient of F-actin meshwork inhlb1root hairs could explain the tip secretion and root hair growth defects of the mutant. The mis-sorting of RFP-AFVY to the apoplast ofhlb1is reminiscent of another post-Golgi trafficking mutant calledunhinged-1, which is disrupted in a gene encoding VASCULAR SORTING PROTEIN51 (Pahari et al., 2014). Mis-sorting of RFP-AFVY was only partial as the marker still accumulated to a large extent in the vacuole lumen ofhlb1. The RFP-AFVY assays were verified by observations that PIN2-GFP accumulated in lytic vacuoles when incubated in the dark and that FM1-43 decorated the tonoplast inhlb1. Future studies will determine whether other markers of vacuolar targeting and morphology are altered inhlb1. In animals, someTPRdomain proteins localize to the endomembrane system. For instance, the endosome-localized sorting nexins SNX20 and SNX21 containTPRmotifs in addition to their phox homology (PX) phosphoinositide binding domain. These sorting nexins have been proposed to function as membrane-associated scaffolding proteins that could potentially interact with transmembrane ligands for transport through the endomembrane system (Clairfeuille et al., 2015). In addition to theTPRmotifs, HLB1 contains a C-terminal domain that is highly conserved among land plants. Protein domain prediction software indicates that this C-terminal domain can form a helical structure and manual annotation revealed that it had weak similarity (∼15%) to the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of Arabidopsis PLECKSTRIN HOMOLOG1. Like PX domains, PH domains bind to phosphoinositides and could facilitate targeting of proteins containing these domains to membranes (Boss and Im, 2012). Consistent with the possibility that the C-terminal domain of HLB1 has similar functions to canonical PX or PH domains, we showed through GFP-HLB1 deletion constructs that HLB1 localized toTGN/EEcompartments primarily through its C-terminal domain. Although direct binding of the HLB1 to lipids has yet to be demonstrated, the root hair defects ofhlb1suggest that the HLB1 C-terminal domain could provide a mechanism for integrating phosphoinositide signaling with actin-mediated tip growth regulation. In this regard, phosphoinositides have been implicated in actin-mediated root hair tip growth (Vincent et al., 2005;Yoo et al., 2012) and mutants disrupted in various steps of phosphoinositide metabolism have altered root hair development (Kusano et al., 2008;Stenzel et al., 2008;Thole et al., 2008) that mirrors the root hair phenotypes ofhlb1. One explanation for the root hair defects of thehlb1mutant is that HLB1 functions in recycling of phosphoinositide metabolizing enzymes or phosphoinositides to thePMof the root hair apex. Future studies will test this hypothesis using fluorescently tagged phosphoinositide reporters and enzymes. The trafficking defects ofhlb1were similar to the previously characterized dominantbex1andbex5mutants (Feraru et al., 2012;Tanaka et al., 2014). In this regard, we speculate that BEX1, an ARF1A1C small GTPase, and BEX5, a RABA1b small GTPase, could functionally converge onto similar trafficking pathways mediated by HLB1. It is important to note, however, that despite the similarities in membrane trafficking phenotypes ofhlb1to those of thebexmutants, they differed in their seedling sensitivity toBFA. Whereasbex1andbex5seedling growth was reported to be hypersensitive to moderateBFAconcentrations (Feraru et al., 2012;Tanaka et al., 2014),hlb1seedlings showed wild-typeBFAsensitivity. T-DNA knockoutbex5mutants did not show the trafficking defects characteristic of the dominant-negativebex5-1, suggesting functional redundancy with other closely related RABA1b GTPases (Feraru et al., 2012). In the future, it will be interesting to test howbexloss-of-function mutants respond toLatBand to determine whether ARF1A1C and RABA1b operate in common exocytic trafficking pathways as HLB1. Although HLB1 is encoded by a single Arabidopsis gene and thehlb1mutant showed clear defects in exocytosis and heightened sensitivity toLatB, the mild root phenotypes ofhlb1in the absence ofLatBsuggests that HLB1 could function redundantly with other unknown nonhomologous proteins in plant development. HLB1 Potentially Links Post-Golgi Traffic to the Actin Cytoskeleton in Plants The involvement of the actin cytoskeleton in endocytosis and protein recycling has been documented in plants using both pharmacological and genetic approaches. For example, sterol endocytosis was found to be disrupted inact2mutants and by treating wild-type plants with cytochalasin D (Grebe et al., 2003).LatBand cytochalasin were also shown to influence the recycling and polar localization of PIN proteins in root and leaf epidermal cells (Geldner et al., 2001;Nagawa et al., 2012). Finally,LatBwas reported to interfere with protein traffic to the vacuole in protoplasts and intact roots (Kim et al., 2005). It is important to note, however, that in the aforementioned studies, high micromolar concentrations ofLatBwere used to trigger the reported effects on protein trafficking. The fact thathlb1displayed strong protein trafficking and seedling growth defects in response to low nanomolar doses ofLatBsupports the hypothesis that HLB1 is a crucial component of post-Golgi traffic that is strongly dependent on the maintenance of an intact actin cytoskeleton. This hypothesis is further reinforced by the observation that heightened sensitivity toLatBwas more pronounced inhlb1andben1mutants compared with mutants with lesions in genes encoding actin itself (e.g.,act2andact8) or mutants to a suite of other actin regulatory proteins, most of which were notLatBhypersensitive. In this regard, another possible explanation for the hypersensitivity ofhlb1mutants toLatBis that loss of function ofHLB1causes mild recycling defects of several proteins directly involved in actin function particularly those that localized to thePM. The collective recycling defects of severalPM-localized actin regulatory proteins, although mild, could sensitizehlb1to even low doses of actin antagonists. In summary, a forward-genetic screen for altered sensitivity to the actin-disrupting drugLatBled to the discovery of a previously uncharacterized protein involved in endomembrane trafficking in plants. TheTPRdomain-containing HLB1 protein, which is encoded by a single gene in Arabidopsis, functions in protein recycling to thePMbut could also contribute to constitutive secretion and trafficking to the vacuole in specific cell types. The shared phenotypes ofhlb1with other exocytic and endocytic trafficking mutants such asben1,bex1, andbex5indicate that theTGN/EE-localized HLB1 protein lies at a crucial step where exocytic and endocytic pathways converge and therefore represent a class of plant-specific membrane scaffolding proteins likely involved in linking post-Golgi traffic with the actin cytoskeleton. Forward-Genetic Screening and Mapping ofhlb1 AnArabidopsis thalianaactivation-tagged T-DNA seed stock (CS31100) from the ABRC was sterilized in 95% ethanol and 20% bleach according toDyachok et al. (2009). Sterilized seeds were suspended in an autoclaved solution of 0.5× Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 1% sucrose (pH 5.7), 100 nMLatB(Calbiochem-EMD Chemicals), and 0.5% agar (Sigma-Aldrich) after the solution had cooled to 55°C. The seed suspension was gently swirled in a 500-mL Erlenmeyer flask to disperse the seeds uniformly and poured into 10 × 10-cm square Petri plates before the agar solidified. Petri dishes were left at 4°C for 2 d and transferred to a growth chamber with 120 μmol m−2s−1light intensity supplied with fluorescent bulbs and set to a 14-h-light and 10-h-dark cycle. Temperature in the chamber was maintained at 23°C while keeping plates in a vertical position. After 5 to 6 d, seedlings with severely inhibited primary root growth were selected. Primary root growth of the progeny of selected seedlings was compared with the wild type on a range ofLatBconcentrations. Homozygoushlb1(Col-0 ecotype) was crossed to the Landsbergerectaecotype, and F2 seedlings were selected based on their enhanced sensitivity to 50 nMLatB. Simple sequence length polymorphism and cleavage of amplified polymorphic site markers were used to maphlb1to a 60-kb region on the lower arm of chromosome 5 (Lukowitz et al., 2000). DNA was extracted from root tissue of 2-week-oldhlb1seedlings by grinding in liquid nitrogen with a mortar and pestle followed by mixing with an equal volume of Plant DNAzol Reagent (Invitrogen) and chloroform. After precipitation with ethanol, DNA was washed multiple times and then dissolved in 50 μL water. Full-length genomic DNA of various genes in the 60-kb region was sequenced and compared with the Arabidopsis reference genome (TAIR10) until the 2-bp deletion was found inAT5G41950. Three SALK lines with predicted insertions inAT5G41950(SALK_046760, SALK_144501, and SALK_065836) were obtained from ABRC and genotyped to ensure homozygosity using the following primers: SALK_046760LP (5′-TTGCTGGAGGAAGCTTGTAAG-3′), SALK_046760RP (5′-TGGCTGTATAACTCACCAGGG-3′), SALK_065836LP (5′-TTCCCTCTCGCATAAATTGTG-3′), SALK_065836RP (5′-TCAGGTTGCAATTTGATTTCC-3′), and LBb1.3 (5′-ATTTTGCCGATTTCGGAAC-3′). The primer pair used for SALK_144501 was the same as SALK_046760. One SALK line (SALK_013761) with a predicted exon insertion inAT3G43300(MIN7/BEN1) was obtained from ABRC. Homozygousben1mutants were isolated using the following primers: SALK_013761LP (5′-TGGAAAGTGAAATTGGTGAGC-3′), SALK_013761RP (5′-CAAGGATTCTTCTCTGCATGG-3′), and LBb1.3. Chemical Treatments and Seedling Growth Assays Working solutions ofLatB(Calbiochem),BFA(Sigma-Aldrich), cytochalasin B and D (MP Biomedicals), indole-3-acetic acid, and 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) were diluted from stock solutions in DMSO. Working solutions of sodium chloride and mannitol (Sigma-Aldrich) were prepared directly from solids from the manufacturer’s containers. Seedling growth assays were conducted by transplanting 3- to 4-d-old seedlings grown on solid (1% agar) ontoMSmedium supplemented with the various chemicals. Seedlings were grown vertically for an additional 4 to 7 d after transplanting in a 14-h-light (120 μmol m−2s−1) and 10-h-dark cycle or in complete darkness in a growth chamber set to 23°C. In another set of experiments, 4-d-old seedlings with straight primary roots were transplanted on new Petri plates withMSmedium. After 1 h of vertical growth, plates were reoriented by 90 degrees and primary roots were photographed every hour for 12 h. Images of seedlings were captured using a DXM1200C digital camera (Nikon) mounted on a copy stand or an SZX12 stereomicroscope (Olympus). Hypocotyl, primary root and root hair lengths, and root curvature were measured using the Image J v1.49 software (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). The 3- to 4-d-old wild-type (Col-0 ecotype) andhlb1seedlings expressingPIN2-GFPorHLB1-GFPwere incubated onBFAorLatBdiluted withMSmedium on welled plates for various time periods and mounted on glass slides prior to imaging with a Leica TCS AOBS confocal scanning laser microscope (Leica Microsystems). For endocytic assays, a working solution of 4 μM FM1-43 (Invitrogen) was prepared inMSmedium from a 10 mM aqueous solution. After incubating for 30 min in liquidMSmedium, 3- to 4-d-old seedlings were pulse labeled with FM1-43 for 5 min at room temperature. Seedlings were then treated with 50 μMBFAfor 1 h prior to confocal imaging. In a separate set of seedlings expressing PIN2-GFP or pulse-labeled with FM1-43,BFAwas washed out by transferring seedlings to liquidMSmedium prior to imaging. Generation of HLB1-Green Fluorescent Protein Constructs TheHLB1pro:HLB1-GFPconstruct was generated from full-lengthHLB1gDNA extracted from roots of 2-week-old wild-type Arabidopsis seedlings using the Plant DNAzol Reagent (Invitrogen). Full-lengthHLB1gDNA including ∼400 bp immediately preceding the start codon (3319 bp total) was amplified using the following primers: HLBpro-F-XmaI (5′-CATCCCGGGGACTACTTATATCTTTCACTCTTGTTC-3′) and HLBpro-R-XmaI (5′-TACCCCGGGCACCGGTGATAATACCGGCTA-3′). The product was cloned into a modified pCAMBIA1390 vector as described (Wang et al., 2008). 35Spro:GFP-HLB1was generated from full-lengthHLB1cDNA (1698 bp) amplified using the following primers: HLB-F-NcoI (5′-CATCCATGGTAATGGCGGATACTGTTGAAGAG-3′) and HLB-R-SpeI (5′- CATACTAGTTTAACCGGTGATAATACCGGC-3′). The resulting product was digested withNcoI andSpeI (New England Biolabs) and cloned into a modified pCAMBIA1390 vector behind the CaMV 35S promoter driving expression of GFP (Wang et al., 2008). To generate the GFP-HLB1∆CTDfusion, a truncatedHLB1cDNA fragment, from position 1 to 1482 bp, was amplified using the primers HLB1-F-NcoI and HLB1∆CTD-R-SpeI (5′-TACACTAGTTTATACCGTCTTCCTCTCCACGT-3′), and the resulting product was digested withNcoI andSpeI (New England Biolabs) and cloned into a modified pCAMBIA1390 vector. Similarly, the GFP-HLB1∆TPRfusion was created by first amplifyingHLB1cDNA from position 1 to 609 bp with the following primers: HLB1∆TPR-F-NcoI (5′-CATCCATGGTAATGGCGGATACTGTTGAAGAG-3′) and HLB1∆TPR-R-SpeI (5′-TACACTAGTACGTTGGCGAGATCGACC-3′). This fragment was digested withNcoI andSpeI (New England Biolabs) and cloned into a modified pCAMBIA1390 vector to created HLB11-609. Next, anHLB1cDNA fragment was amplified from position 1276 to 1698 bp with the following primers: HLB1∆TPR(2)-F-SpeI (5′-CATACTAGTCTACCTCTCCCGCATCTTAAAGT-3′) and HLB1∆TPR(2)-R-PmlI (5′-TACCACGTGTTAACCGGTGATAATACCGGC-3′). This fragment was digested withSpeI andPmlI (New England Biolabs) and cloned into the HLB11-609construct. The35Spro:OsHLB1-GFPconstruct was generated by amplifying full-lengthOsHLB1cDNA (1449 bp) with the primers OsHLB1-F-SalI (5′-CATGTCGACATGGAGGATTCTGCGCGG-3′) and OsHLB1-R-EcoRI (5′-GTAGAATTCACCAGTAATGATACCTGCCAATACA-3′). The product was digested withSalI andEcoRI (New England Biolabs) and again cloned into a modified pCAMBIA1390 vector. Constructs were introduced intohlb1-1viaAgrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation using the floral dip method (Clough and Bent, 1998). Confocal Microscopy and Colocalization Studies hlb1-1seedlings expressing HLB1pro:HLB1-GFP were crossed with various red- or cyan-emitting marker lines. The PIN2-GFP, Man49-mCherry, SYP61-CFP, mCherry-VTI12, mCherry-RabA1g, mCherry-Ara6, GFP-ABD2-GFP, mCherry-ABD2-mCherry, MIN7/BEN1-GFP, RFP-AFVY, and SEC-RFP lines were described previously (Nelson et al., 2007;Robert et al., 2008;Geldner et al., 2009;Nomura et al., 2011;Feraru et al., 2012;Renna et al., 2013;Dyachok et al., 2014). To generate the UBQ10pro:Lifeact-mEGFP construct, mEGFP with the 51-bp Lifeact sequence directly upstream was amplified from plasmid DNA described byVidali et al. (2009)using the following primers: Lifeact-F-EcoRI (5′-CATGAATTCATGGGTGTCGCAGATTTGATC-3′) and Lifeact-R-SpeI (5′-TACACTAGTTTACTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGC-3′). The resulting product was digested withEcoRI andSpeI (New England Biolabs) and cloned behind the UBQ10 promoter in a modified pCAMBIA1390 vector. Five-day-old seedlings coexpressing HLB1-GFP and various red- or cyan-emitting markers were imaged with a Leica confocal microscope or Perkin-Elmer UltraView ERS spinning-disc confocal microscope. For quantification of F-actin andTGN/EEdynamics, images of epidermal cells in the root maturation zone or root hairs growing along the bottom of 48 × 64-mm cover slips coated withMSmedium in 0.5% agar were captured every 0.5 to 1 s for 1 to 3 min with a Perkin-Elmer spinning-disc confocal microscope equipped with a Zeiss C-Apochromat 63× water or a 100× oil immersion objective. Percentage of occupancy of F-actin was determined using the algorithm described byHigaki et al. (2010). Prior to applying the Higaki algorithm, single cells from the root elongation zone were converted into binary images and filaments skeletonized by software that was developed using MATLAB R2013a (The Mathworks Inc.) as described (Dyachok et al., 2014). Intensity ofBFAagglomerates was obtained using custom software written in MATLAB 8.5. The original images from the confocal microscope were first converted to gray scale and separated into 48 layers by intensity values from zero to maximum (255*255), and a binary image was created. The circle Hough Transform method was used to trace areas occupied byBFA- andLatB-induced PIN2-GFP or FM1-43 agglomerates in the binary images. The average intensity in grayscale images in each of marked agglomerate was calculated. From the same set of images used to calculate agglomerate fluorescence intensity, the number of agglomerates per cell was manually counted. To quantify fluorescence in thePMand cell interior of PIN2-GFP-expressing root cells, we created another algorithm. After converting images to gray scale, binary images were generated after separating the image into 48 layers and classifying the layers based on their intensity values. This allowed us to separate fluorescence of thePMfrom the cell interior where the white area in the binary image corresponded toPMsignals and the black area corresponded to the cell interior. Fluorescence intensity was calculated by accumulating the intensity value of each pixel from thePMand cell interior. Phylogenetic Analysis and Bioinformatics To deduce phylogeny of HLB1, sequences for 141 homologous proteins from 79 species were obtained from GenBank. The amino acid sequences were aligned by MUSCLE algorithm (Edgar, 2004), and unreliable sequences with confidence score lower than 0.6 were removed (Penn et al., 2010). The alignment is available asSupplemental Data Set 3. Subsequent phylogenetic analyses were conducted in MEGA6 (Tamura et al., 2013) based on the maximum likelihood method (Le and Gascuel, 2008). A matrix of pairwise distances was estimated by the JTT model, and the tree with the highest log likelihood (12,977) was chosen with the Neighbor-join and BIONJ algorithm. A discrete gamma distribution was used to model evolutionary rate differences among sites (+G, parameter = 3.2081). All positions with <95% site coverage were eliminated. To findTPR-containing proteins, the Arabidopsis genome was scanned with TPRpred (Karpenahalli et al., 2007). The resulting 587 proteins were compared against the Conserved Domain Database (Marchler-Bauer et al., 2015). The 147 Arabidopsis proteins were identified to have more than oneTPRmotifs. Predicated subcellular localization for theTPRproteins was obtained from the SubCellular Proteome Database and presented inSupplemental Data Set 1. Co-IP experiments were conducted using the Pierce Classic IP kit (Thermo Scientific). Briefly, proteins were extracted by grinding roots of 2-week-old Arabidopsis seedlings expressing35Spro:GFP,35Spro:GFP-HLB, and35Spro:MIN7/BEN1-GFPin liquid nitrogen. The fine powder was then mixed with extraction/wash solution supplemented with 1:100 protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich) by vortexing. The protein extracts were centrifuged at 16,000gfor 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was mixed with control resin via end-over-end shaking in a 15-mL Falcon tube for 1 h at 4°C. The mixture was then added to a spin column and centrifuged at 1000gfor 30 s at 4°C. Rabbit Anti-GFP Monoclonal Antibody (ABCAM catalog number1218, lot number GR181836-3) was added to the cleared protein lysate and mixed by end-over-end shaking overnight at 4°C. Protein A/G plus agarose resin was then added and allowed to mix for 1 h at 4°C. The mixture was again added to a spin column and centrifuged at 1000gfor 30 s at 4°C. The columns were washed five times with extraction/wash solution and then one time with 1× conditioning buffer. The proteins were eluted by adding 2× nonreducing lane marker sample buffer with 20 mM DTT and heating for 10 min at 100°C. Once cooled, the columns were placed inside Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged at 1000gfor 30 s at 4°C. Composition of the eluent was analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry (Bioproximity). Briefly, the samples were digested with trypsin (10 μg/mL) overnight at 37°C. The resulting peptides were dried and redissolved in 50% acetonitrile with 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid. The peptides were resolved with Thermo Easy-nLC1000 column (C18 reverse phase, 50 cm, ϕ 75 μm), ionized with Thermo Easy Spray, and then analyzed with a Thermo Q-exactive quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer. The spectra were assigned to peptides using the OMSSA (Geer et al., 2004), X!Tandem (Craig and Beavis, 2004), and X!Hunter (Craig et al., 2006) algorithms.
