As global temperatures rise due to climate change, understanding how bacteria respond to heat is essential. Bacteria are critical to ecosystems, helping recycle nutrients, break down organic matter, and support plant growth. If they struggle to adapt to warmer conditions, the effects could ripple through ecosystems. Our study tested whetherBacillusbacteria, common in soil and water, could adapt to gradual temperature increases. We exposed seven strains from two groups to experimental evolution under increasing warming conditions, expecting them to evolve heat tolerance. Although some bacteria showed small improvements in heat tolerance, neither group could evolve to grow well at temperatures just three degrees Celsius above their natural range. This is concerning, as climate change could raise global temperatures by 2–4 °C, which could push these bacteria beyond their limits. We also found that c-di-AMP, a molecule that helps regulate potassium levels in cells, was involved in temperature tolerance. These findings highlight the vulnerability of essential bacteria to climate change and underscore the need for further research to predict and mitigate its impacts on ecosystems. Bacteria are often regarded as highly adaptable to extreme environmental changes, including rising temperatures driven by global warming. However, this perception oversimplifies the complexity of bacterial adaptation and does not account for the millions of years it has taken for the diversity of bacteria to adapt to particular niches. This highlights that their adaptive capacity is deeply rooted in long evolutionary processes. Understanding bacterial responses to heat stress is critical, given their central role in nutrient cycling and ecosystem stability, especially as global temperatures are projected to increase by 2 to 4 °C [1,2]. The impact of rising temperatures extends beyond bacterial physiology, with significant consequences for ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles; for example, elevated ocean temperatures alter nitrogen-fixing microbial populations, threatening the nitrogen cycle in coral reefs [3]. Similarly, warming freshwater ecosystems decreases bacterial diversity, disrupting ecological balance [2]. Rising temperatures are also linked to the spread of antibiotic resistance [4,5] and increased abundance of pathogens likeVibrio choleraein coastal waters [6]. These examples underscore the urgency of understanding bacterial thermal adaptation in the context of global climate change. Phenotypic plasticity—the ability of organisms to adjust their traits in response to changing environmental conditions [7,8]—allows species to buffer against environmental fluctuations. This adaptability can extend an organism’s ecological range, potentially leading to genetic assimilation, where initially flexible traits become genetically stabilized [9]. Nevertheless, plasticity has inherent limitations and costs, especially under sustained stress [10]. Reaction norms, which describe how a genotype’s phenotype changes across environmental gradients, are valuable tools for assessing thermal limits and understanding adaptive strategies. We can learn about a given organism’s thermal niche through reaction norms (Wolterek, 1909 [11], cited by Stearns [12]). Mesophilic bacteria, such asEscherichia coli[13] and someBacillusspecies [14], typically thrive between 27 °C and 40 °C. When exposed to higher temperatures, mesophilic bacteria activate a heat-shock response (HSR), which involves the rapid production of heat-shock proteins that stabilize cellular components and temporarily protect against heat stress [15,16]. However, these adaptations are generally short-lived and insufficient for prolonged survival under extreme temperatures.Escherichia coli, as a well-established model organism, has been extensively studied for its physiological responses to thermal stress. Unlike thermal tolerance, which temporarily protects cells from heat damage by activating heat-shock proteins [17], thermal adaptation requires genetic changes that can withstand and sustain growth at higher temperatures beyond the initial threshold [18]. Experimental evolution is a powerful tool for gaining insights into the capacity of bacteria to adapt to specific biotic and abiotic challenges and understanding the types of mutations that shape or enable such adaptations to changing environments [18,19]. It allows researchers to address a key question in evolutionary biology: whether bacteria can evolve similar phenotypic outcomes through the same or different genetic mechanisms—a phenomenon known as convergent evolution [20,21]. Convergent evolution can manifest in multiple ways, including traits that arise via a conserved genetic mechanism within a clade or through distinct mechanistic bases even among closely related species. Previous experiments have documented a rapid adaptive response ofE. colito high temperatures [22], with evidence that the genetic response can be diverse [23]. Similarly, Tenaillon et al. [24] took a whole-genome approach to estimate the extent of evolutionary convergence that occurs during adaptation in 115 populations ofE. coliat a high temperature of 42.2 °C, analyzing the overall genetic basis of adaptation. Their findings highlighted convergence among genes, with the most mutated gene beingrpoB, along with proteins that regulate therpoSstress response (RSS). Although numerous studies have explored the ability ofE. colito evolve at different temperatures [25], few studies have aimed to evolve bacteria to expand their thermal niche. In this context, Murata et al. [26] subjected anE. colistrain to 43 °C and identified 51 genes crucial for thermotolerance, highlighting the diverse genetic pathways involved in developing heat tolerance. Murata introduced the term “critically high temperatures” (CHT) to describe temperatures beyond the thermal limit. Bennett and Lenski [13] sought to isolate evolved lines capable of surpassing the upper thermal limit and found that this limit did not significantly increase in any of the derived lines, even those that evolved at 41–42 °C. Exposure to 44 °C proved lethal, except for one thermotolerant mutant, which managed to grow at 44 °C [27]. Mongold et al. [28] further investigated evolutionary adaptation to what they termed a “lethal thermal environment” by directly shifting evolution to 44 °C. Their findings revealed that three thermotolerant mutants were derived from two progenitor lines that had previously adapted to 41–42 °C, suggesting that these lines extended their upper thermal limit in a stepwise manner relative to their progenitors. Additionally, they noted that not all evolved lines exhibited trade-offs, such as a loss of fitness at lower temperatures. Bacillusstrains were originally isolated from Cuatro Cienegas, Coahuila, México, as described [29]. The strains were collected from sediment in the Churince water system. Three strains grouped with theB. cereus lineagewere 99% similar based on sequence variation of the 16S rRNA gene (accession numbers Bc_370aMK850162.1, Bc_102MK880370, and Bc_111bMK850167.1), as well as four strains from theB. subtilislineage (accession numbers Bs_21MK850173.1, Bs_90MK850153.1, and Bs_427MK850159.1and laboratory strain PY79MK850170.1). Accession numbers for the genomes of the strains are: SAMN09761860:B.subtilis_21_anc_ehb001 (TaxID: 1423); SAMN09761861:B.subtilis_90_anc_ehb002 (TaxID: 1423); SAMN09761862:B.subtilis_427_anc_ehb003 (TaxID: 1423); SAMN09761863:B.subtilis_PY79_anc_ehb004 (TaxID: 1423); SAMN09761864:B.cereus_370a_anc_ehb005 (TaxID: 1396); SAMN09761865:B.cereus_102_anc_ehb006 (TaxID: 1396); SAMN09761866:B.cereus_111b_anc_ehb007 (TaxID: 1396). Strains were preserved at −70 °C in a marine medium [30] supplemented with 80% glycerol. For experimental use, strains were revived by streaking onto marine medium agar plates (1.6% agar) and incubated overnight at 28 °C. Single colonies were transferred into a liquid marine medium and incubated at 37 °C overnight to establish starting cultures. 2.2. Plate Incubation Experiments Temperature tolerance was assessed by streaking the strains onto marine medium agar plates and incubating them at 37 °C, 44 °C, and 55 °C for 24 h. After the initial incubation, plates were transferred to 28 °C and incubated for an additional 48 h. Photographs were taken at both incubation stages to document growth and colony morphology. SevenBacillusstrains with previously characterized thermal tolerance [14] were selected, comprising four strains from theB. subtilislineage (three wild isolates and the lab strainB. subtilisPY79) and three strains from theB. cereuslineage. Ancestral strains were frozen as reference samples. Experimental evolution was conducted in 50 mL Falcon tubes with cultures agitated at 150 rpm. For each strain, three populations evolved at a constant temperature of 37 °C, while another three populations were exposed to an incremental temperature regime starting at 43 °C and increasing to 47 °C over a period of 90 days. Experimental setup and lineage descent. (A) Inoculation and transfers were performed every 12 h until reaching approximately 1000 generations (eight generations per transfer). The plot illustrates the measured temperature profiles of the incubator over 1000 generations both for the population evolved under highly critical temperature (HCT) and the constant (lower) temperature treatment (CTT) at 37 °C. The mathematical model for HCT is represented as 4.04 + 0.59(t0.5), with an R2value of 0.8685. (B) The figure depicts the four parental strains from theB. subtilislineage (left) and their respective descending lines labeled from A to L (HCT) and a to l (CTT_37 °C). Similarly, three parental strains from theB. cereuslineage (right) are depicted along with their corresponding descending lines named from A to L (HCT) and a to l (CTT_37 °C). 2.4. Norms of Reaction to Temperature Reaction norms for parental and evolved strains were determined using growth kinetics at various temperatures. Doubling times were calculated from the exponential growth phase to plot the growth rate against temperature. Strains were reactivated from −70 °C stocks on marine medium agar and incubated at 37 °C for 20 h. A single colony was used to inoculate 5 mL of marine medium broth and incubated overnight at 37 °C with shaking. Cultures were transferred to achieve exponential phase by subculturing 50 µL into fresh broth for 2 h. Growth measurements were performed using a Bioscreen C plate reader (Labsystems, Helsinki, Finland) with a 420–580 nm filter. Each well of a 200-well microtiter plate was inoculated with 5 µL of culture and 175 µL of fresh marine medium broth, with three technical replicates per condition. Optical density was recorded every 30 min for 20 h. Growth kinetics were assessed at 17 °C, 27 °C, 37 °C, 41 °C, 43 °C, 46 °C, 49 °C, and 55 °C. Doubling times were calculated using exponential growth models. Reaction norms were compared usingt-tests and multiple ANOVA tests (significance level 0.05) in Statgraphics 15.2.06 and R version 3.6.2. 2.5. Genome Sequencing and Data Analysis DNA was extracted using the QuickGene DNA tissue kit S (Kurabo Industries LTD., FujiFilm, Osaka, Japan). Sequencing was conducted at Cinvestav-Langebio on an Illumina MiSeq platform at 50× coverage in a paired-end format, with ~180 bp fragment sizes. Paired-end reads were quality-checked using FastQC and trimmed with Trimmomatic. Genome assemblies were generated with SPAdes v3.13.0 and evaluated for quality using N50 and %GC content. Variant calling was performed using GATK Haplotype Caller, and mutations were annotated with Prokka and Patric. Custom scripts were used to integrate Prokka GFF files with VCF data from GATK. Additionally, we employed a “fragmentome” analysis to ensure correct linkage of evolved genomes to their respective parental strains. In this approach, we first generated sets of diagnostic DNA fragments (1000 bp each) from the original ancestral genome sequences. By comparing these fragments against all assembled genomes, we identified those that were uniquely present (i.e., matched only their strain of origin) and thus served as reliable strain-specific genetic markers. Using these diagnostic fragments, we could confidently map evolved reads back to the appropriate parental genome. Unlike standard alignments to a single reference genome, this method provides a lineage-specific signature that helps distinguish closely related ancestral strains and their evolved descendants. This ensures that any potential cross-contamination or mislabeling during experimental evolution or sequencing could be easily detected, as evolved strains must match their diagnostic fragments and not produce hits against other parental genomes. Assembled reference genomes of each representative ancestral strain were obtained, making it possible to generate these strain-specific diagnostic fragments prior to the mapping of evolved sequences. Sporulation was assessed on marine medium plates after seven days at room temperature. Samples were stained with malachite green and examined under a Leica 020-518.500 DM/LS optical microscope (Wetzlar, Germany) to confirm the presence or absence of spores. 3.1. Experimental Evolution at Highly Critical Temperatures and Evolutionary Rescue Growth at 43 °C initially varied significantly among strains. Specifically,B. cereusstrains were highly sensitive, unable to sustain growth beyond 48 h at this temperature, whileB. subtilisstrains exhibited greater resilience. ForB. cereus, growth restoration occurred after lowering the temperature to 42 °C, suggesting an evolutionary rescue mechanism.B. subtilis, in contrast, maintained growth more consistently, allowing for temperature increments of 0.1 °C per day. 3.2. Differences in Plasticity and Critical Temperature Limits To assess changes in thermal tolerance, we compared the reaction norms of evolved and parental strains. Growth kinetics were measured across a temperature range from 17 °C to 55 °C and doubling times were used to construct growth rate curves. 3.2.1. Plasticity and Critical Temperature Limits forBacillus subtilisLineages Norms of reactionBacillus subtilisparental strains (black) and their respective evolved lines at HCT treatment (red) and CTT treatment (37 °C) (blue). Vertical bars are confidence intervals; qt 95% (ANOVA analysis,p= 0.05). Horizontal lines at the top of each graph represent the temperature niche of the ancestral strains (black) and strains evolved under CTT (blue) or HCT treatments (red). Norms of reactionBacillus cereusparental strains (black) and their respective evolved lines upon HCT treatment (red) and CTT treatment (37 °C) (blue). Vertical bars are confidence intervals; qt 95% (ANOVA analysis,p= 0.05). Horizontal lines at the top of each graph represent the temperature niche of the ancestral strains (black) and strains evolved under CTT (blue) or HCT treatments (red). Bs_90 exhibited limited improvement in thermal tolerance, with only minor increases in growth at 43 °C for the D-E-d-e lines and barely significant growth at 46 °C for the D-E-F lines. The Bs_90 strain was the least capable of growing at 49 °C, though all evolved lines still outperformed the parental strain. A trade-off was evident in Bs_90, with all evolved lines showing reduced growth at lower temperatures (17–37 °C). In contrast, the laboratory strain Bs_PY79 showed consistent growth across temperatures up to 37 °C. While some high-temperature-evolved lines (J-K-L) demonstrated improved tolerance at 49 °C, they experienced a marked reduction in growth at 17 °C and 27 °C. Interestingly, all Bs_PY79 lines performed similarly to the parental strain at 43 °C, without surpassing its tolerance at 46 °C. 3.2.2. Plasticity and Critical Temperature Limits forBacillus cereusLineages ForB. cereus, the reaction norms revealed minimal improvements post-evolution. Strain Bc_370a exhibited poorer growth than the parental strain, particularly for lines evolved under the HCT regime, which showed decreased growth at 27 °C and 37 °C. Bc_102 demonstrated the best improvements in thermal tolerance among HCT-evolved lines, though CTT-evolved lines generally showed reduced growth compared to the parental strain. Bc_111b presented a slight increase in growth at 43–46 °C for line U, indicating potential thermal adaptation. However, the S-T-U lines (HCT-evolved) exhibited a reduction in fitness across a lower temperature range (17–39 °C), suggesting maladaptive consequences of high-temperature evolution. 3.3. Changes in Carrying Capacity (K) and Growth Rate (G) 3.3.1. Impact of Temperature on Growth and Carrying Capacity onBacillus subtilisLineages Growth and carrying capacity in parental and experimentally evolved lines. In Bs_427, we observed increases in both K37 and K43 values compared to the parental strain, reflecting an adaptation that may be driven by the growth medium. The enhanced carrying capacity at 43 °C suggests some degree of temperature adaptation, especially for the D-E-F lines. In Bs_PY79, all evolved lines showed increases in K37 and K43, consistent with medium-driven adaptation rather than temperature-specific changes. Parental strains ofBacillus subtilisare represented by black bars, while their descendant lines under highly critical temperature (HCT) treatment are depicted with red bars and those under constant temperature treatment at 37 °C are shown in blue bars. Each panel comprises charts illustrating the maximum change in growth cultures of lines evolved at a constant low temperature (37 °C) and at a highly critical temperature (43 °C) on the left and carrying capacity (K) at 37 °C and 43 °C on the right. 3.3.2. Impact of Temperature on Growth and Carrying Capacity onBacillus cereusLineages Growth and carrying capacity in parental and experimentally evolved lines. In Bc_102, the analysis of K43 revealed stronger adaptation to high temperature in the P-Q-R lines compared to p-q-r. This suggests that thermal adaptation occurred despite the reaction norms not clearly indicating such changes. Specific growth rates (G37) also demonstrated some improvements, although these were less pronounced. For Bc_111b, G43 showed a marked increase across all evolved lines, indicating medium adaptation. However, K43 was significantly higher in the S-T-U lines compared to s-t-u and the parental strain, pointing to an evident effect of temperature adaptation. Parental strains ofBacillus subtilisare represented by black bars, while their descendant lines under highly critical temperature (HCT) treatment are depicted with red bars, and those under constant temperature treatment at 37 °C are shown in blue bars. Each panel comprises charts illustrating the maximum change in growth cultures of lines evolved at a constant low temperature (37 °C) and at a highly critical temperature (43 °C) to the left and the carrying capacity (K) at 37 °C and 43 °C to the right. Summary of temperature plasticity gained on growth and carrying capacity by the evolved lines. ▼ Lower capacity than ancestral line. ▲ Higher capacity than the ancestral line. Empty squares mean the same or similar capacity than the ancestral line. Red, evolved at temperatures above highly critical temperature.

Changes in Colony Growth, Pigmentation, and Loss of Sporulation in Evolved Lines The observed differences suggest a trade-off inB. cereus, where the selective pressure to endure high temperatures may have compromised their ability to grow rapidly. This trade-off likely represents an adaptive strategy prioritizing survival over growth efficiency. Specifically, theB. cereusstrains appear to have evolved a mechanism to endure heat stress by reducing metabolic demands, which could explain their diminished growth rates. We also noted a loss of sporulation ability in several evolved strains. This was particularly pronounced in theB. cereusHCT-evolved lines, suggesting that the evolutionary pressure to maintain vegetative cell function at high temperatures led to a trade-off, where sporulation capacity was compromised. This finding aligns with the hypothesis thatBacillusstrains may sacrifice their ability to form heat-resistant spores to maintain active metabolic processes, which may be crucial for survival in fluctuating but non-lethal high temperatures. 3.5. Convergence in Mutations of Strains Evolved at Highly Critical Temperature Reveals the Role of di-C-AMP and Osmolytes in Temperature Tolerance 3.5.1. Identification and Exclusion of Hypermutator Lines 3.5.2. Classification of Mutations in Lines Evolved at 37 °C (CTT) and Above the HCT Distribution of mutations in lines evolved at constant low temperature (37 °C) across gene functional categories. The figure displays the distribution of mutations observed in lines evolved at a constant low temperature (37 °C), categorized by gene functional categories. Black squares indicate genes with at least one mutation in the depicted category, with the number within the black squares representing the number of mutated genes within that category. White squares denote the absence of mutations in the respective gene functional categories. Gray squares are used for all hypermutant strains that were not analyzed. Additionally, red squares highlight genes that have been described as being associated with the observed phenotype. Distribution of mutations in lines evolved under highly critical temperature treatment (HCT) across gene functional categories. The figure illustrates the distribution of mutations observed in lines evolved under highly critical temperature treatment (HCT), categorized by gene functional categories. Black squares represent genes with at least one mutation in the depicted category, with the number within the black squares indicating the number of mutated genes within that category. White squares indicate the absence of mutations in the respective gene functional categories. Gray squares denote hypermutant strains that were not analyzed. Additionally, red squares highlight genes associated with the observed phenotype. An orange square specifically highlights di-adenylate synthase-encoding genes. 3.5.3. Mutational Analysis in CTT-Evolved Lines 3.5.4. Mutational Analysis in HCT-Evolved Lines 3.5.5. Uncovering of di-Adenylate Cyclases (DACs) in Temperature Adaptation Convergent evolution in lines evolved at highly critical temperatures revealed cyclic di-AMP as a key player. The figure illustrates convergent evolution observed in lines evolved at highly critical temperature (HCT), highlighting cyclic di-AMP as a significant factor. A red X denotes the proteins predicted to be absent due to gene mutation. BothBacillus subtilisandBacillus cereuspossess three cyclic di-AMP synthase genes, with two expressed during the vegetative phase and the third restricted to sporulation. InB. subtilis, the mutated gene wascdaR, a regulator of the synthetase gene, while inB. cereus, mutations impacted thedisAgene, the synthetase itself. Cyclic di-AMP plays a crucial role in regulating K+ uptake, a critical factor in maintaining osmotic balance, suggesting its role in adapting to heat stress. In our study, theB. cereusstrains initially struggled under high-temperature stress but managed to stabilize and recover growth within weeks, although, several times, we had to stop the regime of increasing temperature until the final 300 generations of constant high-temperature selection. These strains accumulated more mutations than those of theB. subtilislineage. This is similar to what Mongold et al. [28] observed forE. coligrowth at the limit of their niche temperature and suggests that evolutionary rescue mechanisms were at play, allowing the strains to persist despite the harsh conditions. The concept of evolutionary rescue is particularly relevant to our observations. Evolutionary rescue occurs when adaptive genetic changes enable populations to recover from near extinction under severe environmental stress [41,42]. Genetic analysis revealed that mutations in genes involved in osmolyte metabolism and heat-shock responses played critical roles in thermal tolerance. For instance, arginine and trehalose metabolism mutations were associated with improved thermal resilience. Arginine biosynthesis is known to be induced under heat stress [35], and trehalose has been suggested to act as a thermoprotectant, stabilizing proteins and membranes [45]. These mutations differ from those described in Ref. [46] from an experimental evolution experiment withB. subtilis, with a temperature regime of 50 °C. Sequencing revealed mutations in genes encoding proteins associated with pathways known to be involved in heat stress response (hrcA,ftsH) and other stress proteins (relAandsigW). We do not expect to find mutations in genes involved in the thermal response, such as those described by Hecker et al. (1996) [36] and Helmann et al. (2001) [35], which, if mutated, would be expected to reduce tolerance to temperature. Our experimental design, starting with two species and multiple strains, allowed us to explore the potential for parallel evolution [56] and identify multiple pathways leading to thermal tolerance. Parallel evolution, defined as the independent evolution of the same phenotype or genotype in response to identical selection pressures, provides insights into the predictability and diversity of evolutionary outcomes. In this study, we observed that while mutations affecting c-di-AMP synthesis emerged in all threeB. cereuslineages, only oneB. subtilislineage (Bs_90) evolved a similar mutation. This finding suggests that while the modulation of c-di-AMP synthesis is a common and potentially “go-to” solution for thermal tolerance, it is not the only pathway. The presence of c-di-AMP mutations in multiple lineages across species highlights its broad utility, yet the absence of these mutations in some evolved lines underscores the diversity of evolutionary strategies. This observation supports the notion that standing genetic variation provides multiple routes to equivalent phenotypes, with natural selection shaping the most accessible solutions within specific genetic and physiological contexts. Multiple pathways can lead to thermal tolerance, even under identical selective pressures, emphasizing the power of parallel evolution to reveal evolutionary constraints and opportunities. These findings align with the idea that evolution often proceeds along a single pathway within a given lineage but that alternative routes remain viable under different genetic or environmental conditions. By leveraging two species and multiple strains, our study underscores the importance of comparative approaches in experimental evolution for uncovering shared and lineage-specific adaptation mechanisms. Our findings suggest that while different genetic pathways can lead to thermal tolerance, these pathways may converge on similar metabolic routes, such as osmotic protection. Mutations in genes regulating c-di-AMP synthesis highlight one such path, given its role in potassium transport and osmotic balance under stress. However, it is important to acknowledge a significant caveat in our analysis: genome sequencing identifies intragenic mutations that could be associated with the phenotype but cannot infer the impact of mutations in intergenic regions. Additionally, when multiple mutations occur within a genome, it is challenging to discern which specific mutations are responsible for the observed phenotypes. When working with wild strains, it is more challenging to reintroduce single mutations to validate the phenotype. Transcriptomic analyses would be necessary to uncover the overarching metabolic strategies and determine how these mutations integrate into the broader cellular response to thermal stress. Such analyses could reveal differential gene expression patterns and regulatory networks contributing to adaptation, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the metabolic adjustments underlying thermal tolerance. The limited thermal tolerance observed in our study, even after experimental evolution, raises concerns about the capacity of microbial communities to adapt to climate change. Given the vital roles ofBacillusspecies in biogeochemical cycles, constraints on their thermal adaptability could have cascading effects on ecosystem functions, nutrient cycling, and soil health. Our findings suggest that while some bacterial populations may experience evolutionary rescue, the associated trade-offs could limit their ecological success and impact global processes. Our observations indicate thatB. cereuslineages tended to accumulate more mutations yet did not achieve markedly better fitness at higher temperatures, whereasB. subtilislineages adapted to elevated temperatures with comparatively fewer mutations, suggesting greater inherent thermal plasticity or more efficient physiological and regulatory mechanisms for coping with thermal stress. Several factors may underlie these differences. First,B. subtilismay possess a more robust stress response system, including efficient chaperones, heat-shock proteins, and membrane adaptations that minimize the need for extensive genetic change. Second, differences in metabolic versatility and regulatory network flexibility may enableB. subtilisto rapidly optimize gene expression and protein function at higher temperatures, whileB. cereusmay rely more on genetic alterations that do not directly translate into fitness gains. Additionally, species-specific genomic architecture and mutation biases could shape distinct evolutionary trajectories, withB. cereuspotentially having less efficient DNA repair or a mutational spectrum that fails to confer adaptive benefits under thermal stress. Furthermore, the evolutionary histories and ecological niches of these species influence their baseline adaptability; for instance, the laboratory-adaptedB. subtilisstrain-like PY79 may have evolved pre-adaptations suited to fluctuating conditions, whereasB. cereus, adapted to more stable environments, struggles to exploit novel thermal niches despite generating substantial genetic variation. For example, such lineage-specific adaptations have been documented by Guinebretière et al. (2008) [57], who showed that different taxonomic groups ofB. cereusdisplay lineage-associated thermal profiles ranging from 7 to 50 °C, explaining whyB. cereuspopulations in warm parts of a dairy process differ from those in colder parts [58]. In addition to well-characterized experimental evolution studies inE. coli(e.g., Tenaillon et al. [24]), recent research has increasingly explored evolutionary dynamics inBacillusand other wild bacterial lineages under various selective pressures. For instance,B. subtilishas served as a model in experimental evolution to investigate adaptation in plant-associated environments and in the presence of competing species. Pomerleau et al. [59] demonstrated thatB. subtilisrapidly evolved enhanced root colonization capacity under biotic stress imposed byPseudomonasspecies, pinpointing mutations in regulators linked to biofilm development. Likewise, Blake et al. [60] showed thatB. subtilispopulations adapted to the rhizosphere ofArabidopsis thalianadiversified into distinct lineages, with some evolved strains improving their host-specific colonization abilities. These findings highlight how environmental context shapes adaptive trajectories and can promote genetic diversification. Environmental fluctuations and life-history traits can further influence evolutionary outcomes. Shoemaker et al. [62] reported that the capacity for dormancy (“seed banking”) inB. subtilisalters the trajectory of molecular evolution over extended timescales, increasing genetic diversity and affecting the direction of selection on certain genes. Although our experimental design did not directly examine dormancy states, such findings suggest that the intrinsic traits of species, including the ability to form spores, may shape the pace and path of thermal adaptation. Finally, recent molecular and genomic studies highlight the complexity of responses at the RNA and gene-regulatory levels. For example, Jolley et al. [63] demonstrated thatB. subtilisdynamically adjusts its RNA structure in response to temperature changes, potentially providing an additional layer of rapid, non-mutational adaptation. Similarly, Hawkins et al. [64] and Shi et al. [65] explored how essential genes and sporulation-related loci evolve over time, offering insights into how baseline genomic architecture and gene regulatory networks can influence adaptive potential. The experimental constraints of this study, which included the passes for only 1000 generations and laboratory-based conditions, may not fully reflect the complexities of long-term evolutionary dynamics or the ecological interactions that occur in natural settings. Additionally, while we identified several mutations, especially those related to di-adenylate cyclase (DAC) genes, more studies would be necessary to understand their roles. This could involve transcriptomic analysis to better understand gene expression patterns in response to thermal stress. Furthermore, exploring the broader ecological context of these findings, such as how they translate to natural microbial populations and how bacteria respond to other environmental stressors like desiccation or nutrient scarcity, will be essential to evaluate bacterial adaptability and resilience comprehensively. This study emphasizes the need for more research into the evolutionary and ecological limits of microbial adaptability to predict and mitigate the broader consequences of climate change on vital biogeochemical processes.
