  "content": "Meta-analysis of the space flight and microgravity response of the Arabidopsis plant transcriptome Received 2021 Jul 22; Accepted 2023 Jan 10; Collection date 2023. Subject terms:Plant sciences, Genetic databases Spaceflight imposes a unique suite of environmental effects on biology. For example, microgravity severely curtails the signals normally generated on Earth from the intrinsic weight of a plant’s organs1and by its gravity perceptive cells2–4. By contrast, in the terrestrial environment, these are key factors driving normal growth and development. In addition, gravitational forces on Earth govern a host of physical processes including gas and liquid flow that are important for normal plant function. Thus, the microgravity environment can lead to the development of anoxic regions around metabolically active plant tissues and altered patterns of evaporative and convective cooling that can impact leaf function and physiology5–8. Additionally, the increased radiation exposure inherent in spaceflight is likely to trigger its own array of responses within the plant. The combination of these spaceflight-linked effects is outside the evolutionary history of terrestrial biology and so it remains complicated to predict the effects of spaceflight on organisms. Yet, understanding the molecular and physiological responses of plants to these conditions remains an important goal for space biologists, not the least because plants are integral to many plans for life support on long-duration crewed missions and for colonization9. We have therefore imported 15 spaceflight-related plant transcriptome datasets from the GeneLab data repository and manually curated the associated metadata to develop a metadata matrix (hereafter, the Matrix). This approach allows the more robust design of comparisons between studies that share commonalities in experimental design. Our meta-analyses broadly confirmed the spaceflight-related changes in cell wall processes and oxidative stress that were highlighted in many of the original publications associated with each individual study. Additionally, Matrix-driven analyses helped reveal new response elements, such as conserved spaceflight-triggered changes in expression of the cold response geneCOLD RESPONSIVE 78(COR78), and likely shifts in ion transport processes. We also identified factors within the experimental design such as choice of flight hardware and especially assay technique (i.e., microarray versus RNA-seq) that can impose greater differences between datasets than the spaceflight treatment. Thus, the Matrix allows researchers to explore the wealth of plant biology transcriptomic data generated during spaceflight-related studies and provides an approach to better understand underlying factors impacting the robustness of comparisons made between the different datasets.

Normalized expression arrays are imported from NASA’s GeneLab repository (https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/projects) and then parsed by the TOAST X-Species Transcriptional Explorer (https://astrobiology.botany.wisc.edu/x-species-astrobiology-genelab) for analysis of common features between experiments (cross experiment intersect analysis). The iDEP.92 R-shiny app59is then used to generate expression heatmaps for clustering, and to perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Multidimensional Scaling analysis (MDS), t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (T-SNE), Weighted Gene Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA) and K-means statistical analyses. Functional analyses are then performed using the online tools at Ensembl GO53, KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genomes)56, AraCyc57and Reactome58. These data are then visualized as tables and dendrograms of the enriched functional groups that are altered by spaceflight and/or related stimuli. Fig. 2. Principal component analysis (PCA) of the 15 plant datasets in the Matrix reveals clustering based on analystical approach (microarray versus RNA-seq) and by lighting conditions.

Pairwise factor correlation analysis creates a weighted network linking studies based on metadata similarity score. Fig. 4. Graphical representation of metadata related to tissues, assay type and flight vehicle. It is important to remember here that the lighting environment for an experiment is often dictated by the hardware that was used, for example, most plant experiments performed to date using the Biological Research in Canister (BRIC) hardware are conducted in the dark. Therefore, lighting and hardware are inevitably closely linked in our network analyses of current datasets. This observation also highlights the insight that could be gained by performing more studies that use the same hardware but with a range of lighting environments. Such analyses could help separate hardware-related effects on the plant during growth in space from those specifically triggered by the lighting environment under those conditions. Mining the Matrix for common patterns of spaceflight-responsive gene expression Insights from the network of connections between the spaceflight-related datasets in the Matrix were then used to make comparisons between gene expression patterns seen in spaceflight treatments and ground control samples (e.g., excluding the ground-based spaceflight analog studies). Having defined the assay type (microarray versus RNA-seq) as one of the most important confounding factors when comparing spaceflight responsive transcripts across multiple datasets (Fig.2), the microarray and RNA-seq datasets were separated into two parallel analysis pipelines. The data of the DEGs within the two series of datasets was then analyzed using Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA). Unguided WGCNA clustering identified 3 groupings within the microarray datasets and 4 within the RNA-seq data (Fig.5a–c). Krishnamurthy et al.17have compared microarray and RNA-seq analyses of identical samples from Arabidopsis roots, concluding that although the two approaches broadly agreed (on ~66% of ~6400 DEGs in their study), RNA-seq analysis revealed significantly more DEGs. Thus, in our study the RNA-seq is likely providing a broader dataset within which to find enriched Gene Ontologies likely leading to the increased number of groupings found by our analysis. Fig. 5.

Analysis of studies using common hardware: BRIC datasets provide 2 tissue types and 2 transcriptome assay types for meta-analysis Comparison of the differentially expressed gene counts from in-house and common pipeline analyses. Data is taken from the original spaceflight research publications (in-house, i.e., using the original authors’ analyses withp≤ 0.01) and the GeneLab analysis (p≤ 0.01, adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing using the Benjamini and Hochberg method). Fig. 6. Analysis of shared DEGs between the in-house and GeneLab pipeline analyses of plant experiments performed in spaceflight using the BRIC hardware.

Analysis incanddperformed using Metascape. We next used Metascape analysis on these lists of DEGs from the analysis ofGLDS-37andGLDS-38to explore potential protein:protein networks, applying Metascape’s protein-protein interaction enrichment analysis and Molecular Complex Detection (MCode)28. These analyses take the lists of differentially expressed genes and mine an array of protein interaction databases (STRING29, BioGrid30, OmniPath31, InWeb_IM32) for enriched networks of physical interactions. MCode then allows a focus on highly connected hubs when the numbers of proteins in the network become very high. These analyses again revealed enrichment for a response network associated with ion transport and chaperone activity (Fig.7). In addition, multiple network clusters related to protein ubiquitinylation were identified. This observation suggests spaceflight may have triggered alterations in proteasome activity, possibly related to stress-induced protein turnover. Such a response to stress-related protein dysfunction would be consistent with the elevated chaperone activities suggested by the heat shock protein (HSP)-related protein:protein interaction cluster identified in this same analysis.

Size of circle shows the number of protein:protein interactions that each node/locus is annotated as being involved with as identified by the MCode analysis. Intersection between RNA and microarray analyses By combining the differentially expressed gene lists from both microarray and RNA-seq analyses identified using the GeneLab common pipeline approach, 6 common spaceflight response loci were identified but in only three of the studies (GLDS-37,GLDS-38, andGLDS-121). This observation reinforces the idea that variation in experimental design and analysis approach may be obscuring some common patterns of response (see below). Within the BRIC-19 experiment that generated the data inGLDS-37, in addition to the Col-0 ecotype (also used inGLDS-38) and Ler-0 (also used inGLDS-121), two additional ecotypes were investigated (Cvi-0, Ws-2). These same six genes were also differentially expressed across all the ecotypes in this study, reinforcing their likely common response nature. These 6 common genes were: AT1G74310 (HOT1/HSP101;HEAT SHOCK PROTEIN 101), AT1G58340 (ABS4, a plant MATE multidrug and toxic compound extrusion transporter), AT5G52310 (COR78;COLD REGULATED 78), AT4G11290 (PRX39, a cell wall peroxidase), AT5G09220 (AAP2, AMINO ACID PERMEASE 2), and AT1G73480 (MAGL4, an α-β hydrolase). Analysis of these loci using the graph-based network analysis tool KnetMiner23revealed broad connections to the plastid and membrane function (Fig.8). Fig. 8.

Some of these genes have been discussed in the individual analyses originally published on each BRIC experiment(s)18–22. However, the power of the current meta-analysis lies in highlighting these particular genes as possible core markers of the spaceflight response across multiple experiments within the BRIC hardware and revealing a difference inGLDS-17andGLDS-44. Interrogating the experimental design reveals that one obvious difference betweenGLDS-17and the other BRIC investigations is that 3% (w/v) sucrose was used in the seedling media in GLDS-17 compared to 0.3–1% (w/v) in the other studies. Sucrose is generally added to the media of Arabidopsis seedlings to support the heterotrophic growth of the plants in the dark conditions in the BRIC. However, the higher sucrose in BRIC-17 [https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-17] was specifically added to facilitate comparisons between the seedlings in this experiment and a parallel set of cell cultures that required much higher sucrose for growth. The differences in gene expression between BRIC-17 [https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-17] seedlings and the other BRIC experiments then implies that changes in primary metabolism experienced by the etiolated seedlings in the BRIC may be an important factor in determining spaceflight related transcriptional responses, echoing the altered primary metabolism inferred from our meta-analysis across all the spaceflight datasets analyzed as part of the Matrix in Fig.5. Such observations are especially relevant in the context of possible spaceflight-related hypoxia discussed above. Indeed, Loreti et al.,33used microarray analysis in ground-based research to investigate the changes that take place in seedlings that experience low oxygen stress with or without the addition of external sucrose. Their analyses revealed that exogenous sucrose significantly alters patterns of anoxia-related transcriptional change. Thus, the increased sucrose concentration in the media found inGLDS-17should dramatically affect the plant hypoxia response and so is likely to alter responses to this particular effect of the spaceflight environment. Looking at the shared DEGs betweenGLDS-37,GLDS-38, andGLDS-121identifiesHSP101as a common spaceflight response marker. Indeed, upregulation of Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs) in the spaceflight environment is well known18,19,27,34,35. Heat Shock Proteins are molecular chaperones associated with protecting and refolding proteins in response to cellular damage36. Consistent with the enriched clades corresponding to photosynthesis identified in Fig.5, patterns ofHSP101upregulation and its relationship to the chloroplast (Fig.8), suggest that this protein may play an important role in ameliorating chloroplastic proteotoxic stress possibly resulting from spaceflight-induced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the plastid. Indeed, the HSP100 family are known to be induced by abiotic stressors such as oxidative stress37and have even been linked to tolerance to the proteotoxic damage caused by hypoxia38. Previous work14,19has demonstrated a significant correspondence between patterns of gene expression altered by oxidative damage from the high light stress response on Earth (which is strongly linked to damaging levels of plastid ROS production) and the spaceflight-associated DEGs identified in the seedlings from BRIC experiments. Similarly, the large number of plastid genes responding to spaceflight identified in seedling samples from BRIC-16/GLDS-4422reinforces the idea that this organelle may be an important site of spaceflight-induced responses. However, it is important to note that the BRIC experiments we have analyzed were all conducted under dark growth conditions. Therefore, the light-driven reactions of photosynthetic electron transport that are a major source of plastid ROS production on Earth are not responsible for these spaceflight-related effects and so the source of any spaceflight-triggered ROS production within the plastid remains to be defined. Our meta-analysis using the common GeneLab analysis pipelines also highlightsCOR78as likely a part of a conserved transcriptional response of Arabidopsis on orbit in the BRIC hardware. Although originally identified as a cold induced transcript,COR78is now known to be highly inducible in response to a range of abiotic factors ranging from wounding and salt exposure to osmotic stress, drought and even the hypobaric (low pressure) environments predicted for future large scale, space-based plant growth facilities39–41. A common feature of all these stressors is that they trigger signaling through ROS and induce oxidative stress. Indeed,COR78expression is regulated through the same ROS-responsive transcriptional cascades (i.e., H2O2responsive modulation through the DREB2A transcription factor) that modulates heat shock response elements such asHsfA342, providing a possible link to the heat shock factor component of the spaceflight response. In a further tantalizing link between the chloroplast andCOR78response,COR78expression is co-regulated with elements of the plastid antioxidant system and indeed, its expression is thought to be tightly linked to the levels of H2O2processing by the plant43. It is important to note limitations inherent in the approach we have applied to meta-analysis of these spaceflight datasets. Due to flight and hardware constraints, the spaceflight experiments collected for this meta-study were limited to young seedlings of Arabidopsis. Although some experiments have tested the viability of plants to reach mature and reproductive developmental stages these have generally not involved omics research. We must await the data from more studies throughout the phases of the plant life cycle to understand how well our developing insights from seedlings and young plants will apply to individuals at maturity. Similarly, we must await further studies on a wider array of plant species to extend these approaches beyond the plant most commonly grown in spaceflight, Arabidopsis. One further limitation on our approach is that at present we manually curate the import of each experiment’s metadata into the Matrix. However, the GeneLab data repository has standardized its metadata formats for both current and future datasets offering us the opportunity to automate both import and curation. This automated approach will be facilitated through GeneLab’s automatic programming interface (API) which offers a program-accessible link to the metadata files. Continual updates to the Matrix will allow the power of inferences drawn to grow as quickly as the new plant spaceflight datasets are deposited.
