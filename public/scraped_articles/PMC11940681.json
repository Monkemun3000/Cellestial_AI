Understanding the effects of the spaceflight environment on biological systems is an important area of research because of health concerns associated with increased human spaceflight activities in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and in future deep space exploration of the Moon and Mars. Our research focuses on the skeletal bone loss observed in mammalian rodent models in response to microgravity and space radiation, including their mechanisms of action, and their relative contributions to altered skeletal homeostasis. Rigorously investigating the effects of spaceflight on bone, however, has proven to be complex because of highly variable space experiments conditions, plus technical, logistic and other limitations on the ability to control and replicate those experiments.

(C) Representative studied sites of μCT analysis with type of bone and the thickness of the selected VOI. A specific focus of our study is the femur because of its major weight-bearing role in the mouse. Cancellous regions in the proximal and distal femur provide structural scaffolding during cortical bone growth [14], and are normally atrophied with aging [15,16] post skeletal maturation. Similarly to aging, spaceflight induces unrecoverable resorption of trabeculae in rodents and humans [17,18] and increases fracture risk in long bones [19]. As a primary weight-bearing center in the mouse skeleton [20], the femoral head is an important study site to understand the effects of disuse on skeletal health. Opposite the femoral head, the distal epiphysis of the femur is another site of SEO and direct loading [21] by the torsional stress of keeping the hip joint and ankle aligned [22,23]. Unlike cancellous bone, the comparably low surface area to volume ratio of cortical bone makes it more resilient to bone resorption during spaceflight [18]. Finally, the femoral neck is the thinnest cortical region in this bone, and as such, it is the site of most hip fractures in elderly patients [24], making it another important analysis site for our study. For contrast to the predominantly weight-bearing femur, we also analyzed the L2 vertebra in RR-1 mice. In bipedal humans, the spine is primarily loaded by the weight of the upper body. In quadrupedal rodents, however, the L2 vertebra is thought to be loaded mainly through the articulation of the thorax and abdomen via the lumbar and abdominal muscles, rather than serving a weight-bearing role. Thus, we hypothesize bone loss in the rodent model is a site-specific phenomenon associated with mechanical unloading of weight-bearing sites in the skeleton, rather than other systemic factors. Using standard methodology for the quantification of bone parameters with histology and microcomputed tomography (μCT) [25], within the regions of interest described inFig 1C, we conducted global and same-animal paired comparisons of bone parameters in the femur and L2 vertebrae sites to rigorously test the idea that bone loss in LEO is specific to mechanically unloaded skeletal sites and not due to systemic effects. The bone tissues used in this study were from mice in the NASA RR-1 flight experiment. 12 week old female C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) were matched by weight and assigned to groups (n = 10/group), housed in standard vivarium cages, and acclimated for 4 weeks to control experimental conditions, as previously described [11], prior to launch at 16 weeks of age. Food and water were availablead libitumand further husbandry details have been published [11]. All animal procedures were approved and carried out by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) at the NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) and Kennedy Space Center (KSC). Secondary dissection tissues used in this study were collected by astronauts on orbit and dissected by the RR-1 Biospecimen Sharing Program (BSP) team on the ground. Tissues were awarded by the NASA Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (ALSDA) for study to EACA (femur) and JSA (vertebrae). Reduced specimen numbers in certain sample groups, such as the femoral head, was due to sample damage that occurred during biospecimen sharing dissections. Mice were launched into space at 16 weeks of age and flight conditions were replicated in controls except for transport to orbit on SpaceX Dragon at twice the normal density using a RH Transporter unit on ascent. An Animal Access Unit was used on the ISS to transfer mice from the Transporter to the RH and for accessing the mice during the experiment duration. A Mouse Transfer Box transported mice from the Transporter or the RH to the Microgravity Science Glovebox for injections and on orbit euthanasia when mice were 21 weeks of age [11]. Radiation dosimetry on ISS over the duration of the experiment was measured to be about 7.4 mGy, although shielding by the RH locker and EXPRESS rack likely reduced the radiation dose compared to the rest of the ISS [11]. RR-1 spaceflight experiments were performed as previously described in detail by Choi, et al [11]. In brief, RR-1 used 16-week-old female C57BL/6J mice exposed to microgravity for 37 days on-orbit (FL) in RHs (4 days in flight transit and 33 days on the ISS). A group of ground control mice was housed in standard mouse vivarium cages (VIV) while another group was housed in RHs (GC) (Fig 1A) inside ISS Environmental Simulator chambers (ISSES). The ground control mice were offset by 4 days relative to spaceflight to account for transit time. An additional group of basal control mice was euthanized 1 day after launch (BL). All mice carcasses were kept at -80oC until FL mice samples were returned to Earth (105 days). Upon thawing and dissection, femurs and a section of the lumbar vertebral column were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for μCT, and for paraffin embedding plus sectioning, followed by histological staining. The staining of sulfated glycosaminoglycans (sGAGs) using Safranin-O was performed on 6 μm deparaffinized sections of the femoral head and distal epiphysis to obtain a representative sampling of pre-SEO and SEO samples. Cartilage was stained using 0.1% Safranin-O. Bone tissue was visualized using polarized light and differential interference contrast (DIC). In each animal, a sagittal section of each region was selected for comparisons between experimental conditions and the femoral head plus distal epiphysis, was imaged on Zeiss Axioskop microscope in DIC mode with a 20X 0.5 NA Plan NeoFluar lens (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, New York, USA) for sGAG content evaluation. The right femur from each sample was scanned using Bruker SkyScan 1272 μCT (Kontich, Belgium). Scans were performed at 60 kV of x-ray energy with a 0.25 mm thick aluminum filter. Images were taken every 0.5 degrees and averaged over 3 frames. Scans using the SkyScan 1272 were conducted at 0.6 μm for the femoral head, 3 μm for the femur, and 4 μm for vertebrae. Tomographies were reconstructed with Bruker SkyScan NRecon software and the Instarecon reconstruction server (Instarecon Inc., Urbana Illinois) using a ring artifact correction of 10, and a beam hardening correction of 40%. Reconstruction and segmentation Reconstructed μCT images of the femur were uploaded to DataViewer software (Bruker SkyScan, Kontich, Belgium), and reoriented in two parts; one where the z-axis was concentrically aligned with the midshaft and distal epiphysis, and one where the z-axis was concentrically aligned with the femoral neck. Vertebrae were oriented so both lateral pedicles were parallel. Appropriate orientation was confirmed and visualized in 3D using CTVox software (Bruker SkyScan, Kontich, Belgium). Fixed dimension volumes of interest (VOIs) were selected, and bone regions were segmented using CTAn software (Bruker SkyScan, Kontich, Belgium) for each of the five selected sites. For the L2 vertebrae, a cancellous VOI of 0.6 mm was isolated, extending from the caudal growth plate to its connection with the lateral pedicles. The femoral head was analyzed with a cancellous VOI of 0.4 mm, defined by the tissue between the end of the metaphyseal growth plate and start of the cortical femoral neck. In the femoral neck, a cortical VOI of 0.14 mm segmented the tissue connecting the end of the femoral head region to the femoral shaft. The femoral midshaft was analyzed with a cortical VOI of 0.48 mm, determined by averaging the z-position of the proximal and distal ends of the femur. Lastly, the distal femoral epiphysis had a cancellous VOI of 1.12 mm, extending from the epiphyseal growth plate towards the midshaft (Fig 1C). The BATch MANager program within CTAn, was used to create task lists for 2D and 3D bone analyses and executed for each of the VOIs cancellous or cortical region [25], and output measurements were obtained for comparison between experimental groups. Cancellous bone in the proximal and distal epiphyses was evaluated using percent bone volume (BV/TV, %), number of trabeculae per mm (Tb.N, 1/mm), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th, mm), trabecular separation (Tb.Sp, mm), trabecular pattern factor (Tb.Pf, 1/mm), and connectivity density (Conn.D, 1/mm3). Cortical bone was evaluated using percent bone area (BA/TA, %), average cortical thickness (Ct.Th, mm), endosteal perimeter (E.Pm, mm), and periosteal perimeter (P.Pm, mm). Secondary endochondral ossification was visually evaluated in cross-sectional views of the femoral head to determining if the epiphyseal growth plate and mineralized distal cartilage had been converted to the fully ossified cancellous tissue morphology characteristic of SEO. We used Prism v. 10.1.0 (GraphPad Inc., Boston, Massachusetts), to conduct one-way ANOVA tests between each experimental group for each measurement to identify variability between their means, with α = 0.05 set for the threshold for significance. Tukey’s Honest Significant Difference was implemented for post-hoc analysis, and these p-values were used for significance brackets. To evaluate the magnitude of effect between housing type and spaceflight conditions, the changes of BV/TV in VIV and FL groups relative to GC was calculated. To compare percent change between groups, a one-sample t-test was implemented with a hypothetical mean of zero. A paired t-test was performed between the vertebrae, femoral head, and distal epiphysis within the same sample, which evaluated within-subject variation of bone volume at weight-bearing versus non-weight-bearing site pairs. Bone loss in the weight bearing femoral head and distal epiphysis cancellous bone regions depends on housing type and spaceflight in microgravity In the femoral head, BV/TV was significantly decreased in spaceflight compared to all control environments (BL, −25%; VIV, −18%; GC, −27%) (Fig 2A). FL bones also had significantly fewer trabeculae than basal mice (−15%), which was unchanged in the two control habitats (Fig 2B). FL bones showed thinner trabeculae (BL, −16%; GC, −17%) (Fig 2C), an increase in separation (BL, +26%; GC, +22%) (Fig 2D), and a higher pattern factor (BL, +163%; GC, +755%) (Fig 2E) compared to BL and GC bones. Conn.D remained unchanged (Fig 2F). Interestingly, the VIV group had nonsignificant trends of similar magnitude in their trabecular metrics indicating loss as observed in the spaceflight group. VIV bones had more space between trabeculae than the BL control, which was not reflected in GC indicating a housing effect (+18%) (Fig 2D). Overall, the femoral head shows significant bone atrophy expressed in multiple bone parameters after 37 days in space (Fig 2G). Fig 2. Bone loss in the mouse femoral head is associated with weightlessness in microgravity. Characterization metrics of cancellous bone in the femoral head show that (A) BV/TV is decreased in FL. Bones from FL mice have significantly lower (B) Tb.N and of those trabeculae, spaceflight reduces (C) Tb.Th. Both age and spaceflight increase (D) Tb.Sp, whereas only FL has an increase in (E) Tb.Pf. (F) Conn.D is not significantly affected; however, VIV and FL have similarly reduced Conn.D. VIV bones experience another similar increase in magnitude of Tb.Pf, which was not statistically significant. Data shown are the mean ± standard deviation with a scatter plot (ns: non-significant, * : p < 0.033, **: p < 0.002, ***: p < 0.0002, ****: p < 0.0001). (G) μCT volumetric reconstructions of a representative sample from each group show evident decreased cancellous bone in FL. At the distal epiphysis, BV/TV was significantly decreased in VIV and FL bones from GC levels (VIV, −41%; FL, −55%) (Fig 3A). Similarly to the femoral head, the distal epiphysis in spaceflight samples showed fewer trabeculae as compared to BL (−39%) and GC bones (−42%), which was not observed in VIV bones (Fig 3B). Though trabecular thickness was unchanged (Fig 3C), separation of trabeculae was increased in FL compared to BL and GC (BL, +16%; GC, +14%) (Fig 3D). VIV had significantly higher trabecular separation (+12%) compared to basal mice, a result which was also observed in the femoral head. Spaceflight significantly increased Tb.Pf from GC mice (+27%) (Fig 3E). The FL group had significantly lower connectivity density than BL (−50%) and GC (−52%), which was not seen in the VIV (Fig 3F). This indicates that GC housing in the RH may rescue aging-related bone loss in the distal epiphysis of vivarium cage housed mice. In all trabecular metrics, the VIV group experienced loss trends similar to those in FL bones. Collectively, the data suggest, relative to the RH, the vivarium cage housing allows aging-related bone loss to progress in the cancellous regions of weight bearing bones in the form of fewer trabeculae and fewer plate-like structures (Fig 3G). Fig 3. The loss of bone in the femoral distal epiphysis is affected by housing type and weightlessness conditions in microgravity. Cancellous bone measurements in the distal epiphysis exhibit a housing-related dependency on (A) BV/TV as well as an effect from spaceflight. (B) Tb.N is decreased in FL following the same patterns as BV/TV. Interestingly, (C) Tb.Th. is not affected by age, cage type, or spaceflight, however age and spaceflight significantly increase (D) Tb.Sp (E) Tb.Pf is only effected in FL. (F) Conn.D is decreased in FL. Data shown are the mean ± standard deviation with a scatter plot (ns: non-significant, * : p < 0.033, **: p < 0.002, ***: p < 0.0002). (G) μCT volumetric reconstructions of a representative sample from each group show visibly decreased presence of bone in VIV and FL. Long bone cortical tissues undergo degenerative changes in space Fig 4. Femoral neck marrow cavity is enlarged in spaceflight but not significantly changed with age and habitat conditions. Cortical bone characterization metrics in the femoral neck indicate FL has less (A) BA/TA than VIV. Nonsignificant trends in the data show an increase in (B) Ct.Th in VIV that is opposite in FL. (C) E.Pm is significantly increased in VIV, GC, and FL from BL, though (D) P.Pm experiences no changes. Data shown are the mean ± standard deviation with a scatter plot (ns: non-significant, * : p < 0.033, **: p < 0.002, ***: p < 0.0002). (E) μCT volumetric reconstructions of a representative sample from each group show similar presence of bone in BL and GC, while VIV and FL demonstrate erosion in the endosteal surface. Fig 5. In the femoral midshaft, spaceflight abrogates increases in bone parameters BA/TA and Ct.Th in controls. Cortical bone characterization metrics in the femoral midshaft indicate the effect of age increasing (A) BA/TA and (B) Ct.Th, which is undone in FL. (C) E.Pm and (D) P.Pm are unchanged between groups. Data shown are the mean ± standard deviation with a scatter plot (ns: non-significant, **: p < 0.002, ***: p < 0.0002). (E) μCT volumetric reconstructions of a representative sample from each group show similar presence of bone in BL and GC, while FL demonstrates erosion in the endosteal surface. Load-bearing vertebrae do not show μCT parameter changes related to age, housing, or spaceflight in microgravity Fig 6. Vertebral cancellous tissueμCT parameters are not significantly affected by aging from 16 to 21 weeks, housing type, or microgravity. Cancellous bone characterization metrics in the L2 vertebrae demonstrate no differences between groups in (A) BV/TV, (B) Tb.N, (C) Tb.Th, (D) Tb.Sp, (E) Tb.Pf, or (F) Conn.D. Nonsignificant trends implicate an effect of spaceflight reducing BV/TV, increasing DA, and reducing Tb.N. Data shown are the mean ± standard deviation with a scatter plot (ns: non-significant). (G) μCT volumetric reconstructions of a representative sample from each group show a slight decrease in bone parameters from FL mice, which are not deemed significant by statistical testing. Decreased mechanical loading during spaceflight in microgravity only causes significant bone loss in weight-bearing skeletal sites Fig 7. Bone loss in microgravity versus 1g controls in the RH is specific to weight-bearing skeletal sites. Using one-sample and paired t-tests, findings revealed (A) vertebrae showed no significant change, while the (B) femoral head and (C) distal epiphysis experienced significant bone loss in spaceflight, suggesting that microgravity unloading, but not other systemic factors, caused bone loss in LEO. (D-F) The vivarium cage housing, known to provide reduced topological enrichment, also elicited bone losses of smaller magnitude than spaceflight, but only in weight-bearing bone sites. Secondary endochondral ossification is accelerated during spaceflight in microgravity Following μCT imaging, we characterized the appearance of SEO, a marker of adult skeletal maturation, at both epiphyses in the femur (Fig 8A). As SEO of the femoral head occurs between 21 and 23 weeks of age, bones from the VIV group had twice the occurrences of ossification within the femoral head than BL, and the data shows the GC habitat somewhat rescued this effect. However, FL mice had a 50% ossification rate, 20% above the VIV group, suggesting an increased prevalence of premature skeletal maturation. Interestingly, in the distal epiphysis, GC and FL, and VIV and BL groups had the same occurrences of ossification (Fig 8B), potentially related to distal epiphyseal fusion regulation predominantly by hormonal factors versus mechanotransduction [13]. Fig 8. Spaceflight in microgravity accelerates secondary endochondral ossification of the proximal epiphysis in the femur. FL bones had 50% of their cohort ossified in the (A) femoral head, over twice as many as in GC cohort. Differences in ossification at BL (16 weeks) and the other groups (21 weeks) in the (B) distal epiphysis appear independent of aging. (C) μCT volumetric reconstructions of the femoral head from a representative sample from each group show increased cavitation in the mineralized cartilage of the VIV and FL groups. Fig 9. Spaceflight in microgravity reduces sGAG content in the femoral head and distal epiphysis. Representative histology of Safranin-O staining on femoral heads, with the (A) BL as the control, show a decrease of proteoglycan content in (B) VIV, a loss of the distinct tidemark in (C) GC, and complete deficit in an ossified sample from (D) FL. The distal epiphyses show ossification-dependent changes to the growth plate. During pre-ossification at 21 weeks (F, VIV), proteoglycan content decreases and is upregulated during ossification (GC, FL) to finalize remodeling into the dual-walled gap characteristic of distal epiphysis secondary ossification. Through aging, rodents experience decreased bone volume fraction and trabecular number due to remodeling of the bone favoring periosteal cortical development [44–46]. In contrast, dynamic mechanical loading via exercise significantly increases healthy biomechanical properties of bone [47–49]. The femoral head is also a key site of skeletal development and maturation [50], where secondary SEO of the epiphysis, converts the growth plate and mineralized cartilage into cancellous mineralized tissue [51,52]. Concomitantly, the femoral midshaft experiences high bending torsional loads during normal ambulation [53], making disuse of these areas interesting to compare to other sites of the skeleton that are not weight bearing. In the femur shaft, capacity to hold loads is primarily imparted by cortical bone which typically reaches maximum thickness after twelve weeks of age[44] with significant thinning of the cortical wall not occurring until after eight months of age [54]. Fracture risk is also increased with age [55,56] as cortical bone becomes brittle [57–61] with structural disruption [62], likely due to dysfunctional remodeling [63,64] that may prevent micro-fracture repair [65]. STS missions show insignificant acute changes in cortical bone [17], but long-term loss is resistant to post-flight recovery [66]. Thus, vertebrae might reveal potential systemic bone degenerative effects not associated with microgravity weightlessness unloading as expected in the femur. Furthermore, the RH wire mesh interior is associated with increased mouse physical activity that occurs during long-duration spaceflight after initial acclimation [12] and may load this region of the spine, possibly attenuating minor weightlessness unloading effects. If space radiation in LEO or other systemic factors were the primary effectors of bone loss during spaceflight, we would expect systemic changes to the skeletal system. In that context, for ionizing radiation, we might also expect that thick, minerally dense regions of cortical bone could partially shield the bone marrow cavity and cancellous bone. This, however, does not appear to be the case, as our data shows the vertebral thin cortical and cancellous bone are unchanged in spaceflight (Fig 6), but the femoral neck, which has a substantial cortical region, experiences endosteal cancellous tissue loss (Fig 4). Therefore, our data strongly indicate that spaceflight-induced bone loss, is localized to two well-established direct weight-bearing skeletal locations in the femoral head and distal epiphyses. Moreover, the absence of significant bone loss in the L2 lumbar vertebra after 37 days of spaceflight is consistent with previous scans of L4 archived on NASA’s Open Science Data Repository (OSD-489, Alwood, et. al.). On Earth, the mechanical loading environment within the rodent spinal column is complex, including time- and position-varying loads of lateral bending, flexion/extension, and axial rotation dependent on the task being performed [67,68]. Despite the variation in the gravity vector with respect to the spine orientation, the vertebral body in both humans and quadrupeds experiences intermittent compressive forces and display unique fabric orientation of the cancellous tissue to the gravity vector while on Earth [68]. The response to spaceflight is less understood and likely varies by habitat topology, housing density, age, and experiment duration [10]. As active behaviors are abundantly observed in the RR-1 experiment, we infer the mice are mechanically loading their vertebral body by compression. In contrast, animals housed in the Russian Bion M-1 Habitat, with three mice per enclosure and smooth tubular walls resulting in low topological complexity [69], or in the Japanese Habitat Cage Unit, with single-housed mice and perforated walls that allowed grappling resulting in medium topological complexity [70,71], do not allow for the same running activity. To this effect, mice in the Russian Bion M-1 Habitat, significantly lost cancellous bone in the vertebral body compared to standard housing conditions [72]. Additionally, previous studies from our group using the hindlimb unloading model showed cancellous bone in the lumbar vertebra of male mice to be sensitive to musculoskeletal disuse, resulting in bone loss [73]. Taken together with the running activities and resulting intermittent compression on the ventral spine during RR-1 [12], we interpret the hindlimb unloading model to place less of a mechanical demand on the vertebral column compared to space flown and running mice. Furthermore, we used same-animal paired t-test analyses of bone parameters in weight-bearing bones such as the femur and load-bearing vertebrae to establish, with greater statistical power than one-sample t-test or ANOVA alone, that while the former are subject to loss in space, the latter are not. Additionally, bones from mice in the RH show healthier parameters in directly loaded regions than those from the vivarium (Fig 7). Systemic effects in the vertebrae, if present, should result in weaker cancellous structures and cortical bone would not have experienced the magnitudes of endocortical erosion, as shown in our data. We acknowledge that other potential systemic changes in bone tissue [74,75] may affect mechanical properties of bone, but the data strongly suggest that increased activity and microgravity have opposite effects on bone health parameters only at specific locations within weight bearing bone and no significant effects in bones primarily loaded by muscle tension, as long as the habitat used, such as RH, is permissive of physical activity in space. The totality of the data compellingly supports mechanical unloading as the primary effector of bone loss during spaceflight in LEO. This study supports the hypothesis that bone loss effects we observe in the 37-day RR-1 spaceflight in LEO is site-specific and likely due to mechanical unloading and not space radiation or other systemic factors. It is unlikely that low levels of space radiation, as experienced in LEO, could have systemic effects capable of mediating bone loss, as there are no reports of simulated space radiation effects at this dose and dose rate in cortical bone or lumbar vertebrae. This study, however, does not rule out the likely possibility that longer exposures, or more energetic charged particle space radiation outside of LEO will have significant bone effects. Additionally, the novel observation of accelerated epiphyseal closure in the femoral head primary weight-bearing location in mice, suggests mechanical unloading may accelerate SEO of juvenile growing long bones into a prematurely mature state. The totality of the data strongly supports mechanical unloading due to weightlessness in microgravity, not radiation or other systemic factors, as the primary effector of spaceflight-related bone loss in LEO.
