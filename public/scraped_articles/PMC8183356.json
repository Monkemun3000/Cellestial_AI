Correspondence:fmour@pennmedicine.upenn.edu Tichy et al. reveal a role for NF-κB signaling in regulating telomere length in muscle stem cells (MuSCs) after chronic injuries. Persistent activation of NF-κB leads to shortened telomeres, Ku80 dysregulation, and muscle defects. The findings link stem cell dysfunction and NF-κB-dependent telomere shortening in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The stages of skeletal muscle regeneration are well characterized following injury, starting with necrosis of damaged muscle tissue and the infiltration of immune cells (Frenette et al., 2000;Tidball, 2005). Inflammatory signals both directly and indirectly lead to activation of resident muscle stem cells (MuSCs; also called satellite cells), which respond to muscle damage by population expansion, followed by selective differentiation into myogenic progeny (Chazaud et al., 2003;Tidball and Wehling-Henricks, 2015). Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a fatal X-linked degenerative muscle disease, and it is among the most common lethally inherited disorders in children (Emery, 2002). DMD is caused by mutations in thedystrophingene, which codes for a cytoskeletal protein that acts as a crucial bridging protein between the sarcomere and extracellular matrix (Hoffman et al., 1987). The complete or partial loss of dystrophin in muscular dystrophies impairs the ability of the muscle to contract and causes the muscle to break down. This acts as constant injury to the muscle that progressively affects the MuSC pool (Morgan and Zammit, 2010;Sacco et al., 2010), presumably due to an autonomous dysfunction (Dumont et al., 2015). Thus, MuSC function is severely affected in DMD, and although the disease is initiated by dystrophin deficiency, it is ultimately a stem cell disease (Dumont et al., 2015;Sacco et al., 2010). Previous work showed that accelerated telomere shortening occurs in muscular dystrophy in both skeletal muscle and cardiomyopathy (Mourkioti et al., 2013;Sacco et al., 2010). Recent studies have also revealed that MuSCs derived either from dystrophic mice or young DMD patients exhibit critically shortened telomeres early on during disease progression (Tichy et al., 2017). These observations suggest that modulation or maintenance of MuSC function can prevent or diminish destructive muscle processes in chronic injury conditions. However, the molecular mechanisms contributing to MuSC-specific telomere shortening are currently unknown. NF-κB is dysregulated in dystrophic MuSCs (A) Higher NF-κB activation in FACS-isolated MuSCs from dystrophic mice, as shown by elevated phospho-p65 levels. n ≥ 3 mice (2–3 months old)/group. Percent of cells positive for p-p65 are displayed. (B) Freshly isolated, cytospun dystrophic MuSCs exhibit accumulation of phospho-p65 compared to control MuSCs. Note the lack of staining in the no primary Ab (technical control), highlighting the specificity of the staining. (C) Quantification shows higher levels of p-p65 in dystrophic MuSCs. n = 3 mice (2–3 months old) per genotype. n > 50 cells per condition.

(C) IKK2CA-derived MuSCs had much shorter telomere lengths after 6× injury, while inhibition of NF-κB (NEMOKOMuSC) maintains telomere length even after 20× injuries. Telomere length in MuSCs was normalized to telomere length of contralateral legs. n = 3–5 mice/genotype. Percent difference was calculated between normalized means. (D–F) Distribution of telomere lengths of MuSCs following 3× (D), 6× (E), or 20× (F) injuries.

Mean ± SEM for each bin is displayed. (G–I) Progressive MuSC-specific telomere shortening is associated with worsened histology in IKK2CAMuSCmuscles at 3× (G), 6× (H), or 20× (I) injuries. n = 3–6 mice/condition.

Statistical analyses were performed using unpaired Student’s t test with Welch’s correction. *p ≤ 0.05; ***p ≤ 0.001. MuSC telomere shortening leads to increased DNA damage in telomeres and stem cell exhaustion over time In mammalian cells, DNA damage, in the form of double-stranded DNA breaks, is typically repaired by non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) (Mao et al., 2008) and depends on the activity of Ku80 to recognize damaged DNA ends (Koike and Koike, 2008). Indeed, we observed a higher number of centralized nuclei in regenerating IKK2CAMuSCfibers that positively stained for the DNA damage marker 53BP1 (Figures S3EandS3F). Extensive telomere shortening can be recognized by DNA damage sensors as free DNA ends (Hsu et al., 2000). In fact, we did observe increased numbers of telomere-induced foci (TIFs) in chronically injured IKK2CAMuSCMuSCs (Figures 4Dand4E), as identified by the stem cell marker, vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM) (Figure S3G). These data are in agreement with the notion that telomere dysfunction is governed by proteins that also control DNA damage response (Takai et al., 2003). MuSC-specific NF-κB activation exacerbates the dystrophic muscle defects To explore whether MuSC-specific activation of NF-κB could exacerbate the progression of dystrophy, mdx mice were bred to IKK2CAMuSCmice, and different metrics were assessed. (A) mdx/IKK2CAMuSCexhibited more muscle damage as shown by higher serum creatine kinase activity, a strong indicator of skeletal muscle damage. n > 10 mice (8–12 months old) per genotype. (B) Increased skeletal deformity (kyphosis), as shown by whole body CT images. n = 3–4 mice (12 months old) per genotype. (C) mdx/IKK2CAMuSCmice were substantially impaired in the grip test. n = 4–5 mice (8–12 months old) per genotype. (D) Reduced strength of mdx/IKK2CAMuSCmice compared to mdx mice. n = 3–5 mice (8–12 months old) per genotype. (E) Higher levels of phospho-p65 in isolated MuSCs (upper) and quantification of p-p65 (lower). n = 3–4 mice (4–5 months old) per genotype. n > 30 cells per condition. (F) Telomere length assessment by MuQ-FISH in isolated MuSCs (insert: representative image of telomere staining) shows reduced telomere length in mdx/IKK2CAMuSCmice. n = 3–4 mice (5 months old) per genotype. n > 70 cells per condition. (G) Increased TIFs specifically in MuSCs. n = 3 mice (5 months old) per genotype. n > 70 cells per condition. All datasets are displayed as mean ± SEM. All statistical analyses were performed using unpaired Student’s t test with Welch’s correction. *p ≤ 0.05; **p ≤ 0.01.

Graphed data are displayed as mean ± SEM. Statistical analyses in (B), (E), and (H) were performed using unpaired Student’s t test with Welch’s correction. *p ≤ 0.05; **p ≤ 0.01; ***p ≤ 0.001. Previous work had revealed that MuSCs progressively become dysfunctional in dystrophy, and telomere shortening is a major hallmark of the disease (Dumont et al., 2015;Sacco et al., 2010;Tichy et al., 2017). Here, we provide evidence of thein vivomolecular basis for telomere shortening of stem cells under chronic injury conditions. These findings provide insights into the fundamental regulatory mechanisms of MuSC-specific telomere shortening under chronic injuries. Indications of perturbation of NF-κB signaling exist in various muscle diseases, such as muscle atrophy conditions (Cai et al., 2004;Mourkioti et al., 2006;Mourkioti and Rosenthal, 2008), cancer cachexia (He et al., 2013), dystrophinopathies such as Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2A (LGMD2A) (Baghdiguian et al., 1999), and DMD (Acharyya et al., 2007;Hammers et al., 2016;Messina et al., 2011). In addition to its role in regulating myogenesis (Mourkioti and Rosenthal, 2008), NF-κB is likely to modulate immune responses, muscle damage, and repair in DMD as well as in other muscle disorders. However, the survival effect of NF-κB in LGMD2A muscles, compared with its rather negative contribution in DMD, reflects the complexity of this pathway in chronic muscle diseases. Previous genetically modified animal models generated to interfere with NF-κB signaling only assessed NF-κB function regarding cancer cachexia (He et al., 2013) and aging (Oh et al., 2016;Proto et al., 2017). By targeting the MuSC compartment in adult mice, we demonstrate that the inherent endogenous injuries observed in dystrophic mice induce a constant elevated NF-κB signaling response in MuSCs in both mdx and, most importantly, in human DMD MuSCs. Furthermore, we showed that persistent MuSC-specific NF-κB activation in injured muscles leads to telomere shortening and impairment of regeneration, as shown by the worsened histopathology of skeletal muscles during the progression of the chronic injury. Additionally, we demonstrate that persistent MuSC-specific NF-κB activation in injured muscles drives telomere shortening via a mechanism that does not raise proliferation levels. Instead, we describe an NF-κB-dependent Ku80 dysregulation and increased DNA damage on telomeres in MuSCs from both dystrophic mice and human patients. While the effects of Ku80 in NHEJ are well documented (Fell and Schild-Poulter, 2015), its potential mechanistic involvement in telomere length alteration is less clear. Indeed, the absence of Ku80 has been associated with both telomere lengthening and shortening, depending on the cell line used; the organism (i.e., yeast,Drosophila, mouse, plant); or the context (embryonic development, cancer, or aging) (Boulton and Jackson, 1998;Chai et al., 2002;d’Adda di Fagagna et al., 2001;Didier et al., 2012;Espejel et al., 2004;Gallego et al., 2003;Indiviglio and Bertuch, 2009;Li et al., 2007;Melnikova et al., 2005). Furthermore, it is still unclear when Ku80 could function alone or as a heterodimer of both Ku80 and Ku70 subunits (Fell and Schild-Poulter, 2015). It was previously shown that loss of a single allele of Ku80 leads to dysfunction of muscle-derived cells and accelerated aging (Didier et al., 2012). In this study, we demonstrate that NF-κB regulates Ku80 expression in MuSCs in chronic muscle injuries and dystrophic muscles in both mouse and human. This NF-kB-dependentin vivotelomere regulatory mechanism is different from the modulation of telomeric proteins Tert or Rap1 that have been shown in cancer cells (Teo et al., 2010;Yin et al., 2000;Zuo et al., 2011). Additional work, to generate more targeted molecular tools for Kus and to investigate the exact role of Ku80 in the regulation of telomere integrity (Indiviglio and Bertuch, 2009), will be instrumental in order to identify other contributing molecular mechanisms and to develop concepts that could maintain MuSC telomere length under injured conditions. In summary, this study establishes a link between stem cell functional exhaustion and NF-κB-dependent telomere shortening. Our data suggest that maintaining telomere length of MuSCs could boost the regenerative ability of MuSCs in disease-related chronic injuries such as DMD. It was recently proposed that chronic inflammation can accelerate aging via exacerbation of telomere dysfunction in multiple tissues (Jurk et al., 2014). Therefore, the molecular mechanism presented here for DMD could also be a more generalized mechanism that lowers regenerative potential in other tissues with systemic chronic inflammation and/or accelerates normal and pathological aging.

This study did not generate any unique datasets or code. EXPERIMENTAL MODELS AND SUBJECT DETAILS All animals were housed and bred in accordance with the University of Pennsylvania IACUC guidelines. Mice used in this study include C57BL/6 (Jackson Labs-JAX Stock #000664), IKK2 constitutively active mice (IKK2CA); breeding of JAX stock 008242 for Lox-stop-Lox IKK2CA and PaxERT2CRE(JAX Stock #017763) (Murphy et al., 2011), mdx4cvmice (JAX stock #002378), or mdx4cvbred to IKK2CA. NEMO floxed mice and genotyping protocols were a gift from Dr. Pasparakis. Ku80+/− mice were a gift from Dr. Hasty. For several experiments, Pax7EGFP mice were bred to the aforementioned mouse lines. Mice were genotyped according to established protocols using ear punches as starting material. To induce Cre expression, mice were injected with 250uL tamoxifen (Sigma; 20mg/mL in ethanol/corn oil in a 1/10 ratio) IP twice weekly for a total of 7 injections, starting at 6 to 8 weeks of age. For all experiments, mice of the same sex and similar age were compared. The age of mice for each experiment is reported in Figure Legends. Muscles were injured with 10 μg/mL notexin (Latoxan) weekly. The tibialis anterior (TA), gastrocnemius, and quadriceps muscles of one hind limb were injured with 10 μL (TA) or 20 μL (gastrocnemius and quadriceps) notexin. Muscles were collected post-injury at three days (for MuSC isolation) or at seven days (for staining with Hematoxylin and Eosin). Human samples were a gift from Dr. Sacco (Tichy et al., 2017). Human muscle biopsies from healthy and DMD patients were obtained from the lower extremity muscles during surgical procedures as part of the patient’s clinical care plan at Rady’s Children’s Hospital, San Diego. Written informed consent from patients, parent or guardian was obtained for all subjects. The protocol was approved by the University of California, San Diego Human Research Protectants Program and Institutional Review Board in accordance with the requirements of the Code of Federal Regulations on the Protection of Human Subjects. All materials were collected from de-identified males. MuSCs were FACS-isolated as previously described (Tichy et al., 2017). Briefly mice were sacrificed, and the tibialis anterior, quadriceps and gastrocnemius muscles were dissected from both hind limbs. Muscle was finely minced and placed in a C tube (Miltenyi) containing 0.15% collagenase in 10 mL DMEM. Tubes were loaded into a MACS Dissociator (Miltenyi) and the manufacturer’s muscle-01 program was run. Tubes were incubated in at 37°C for 30 min, subjected to the muscle-01 program again, and incubated at 37°C for an additional 30min. Seventy-five microliters of 2% collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich) and 75 μL of 4.8 U/mL dispase (Roche) was added, and tubes were vortexed at maximum speed prior to a 30min incubation at 37°C. Cells were passed through a 21-gauge needle until all muscle was broken apart. The remaining cell slurry was filtered through a 40 μM cell strainer that was prewet with 10 mL of cold myoblast media (DMEM:F12; 15% FBS, 1X anti-anti) the strainer was rinsed with an additional 10 mL of cold myoblast media, and cells were pelleted at 300xg/4°C. Cells were incubated with 1mL 1X red cell lysis buffer (ThermoFisher) for 5 min at room temperature and 9 mL cold FACS buffer (2.5% goat serum, 2 mM EDTA, pH 8.0 in 1X PBS) was added. Cells were spun and resuspended in 1mL of FACS buffer containing biotin-conjugated antibodies raised against antigens CD45, CD31, CD11b, and Sca1 prior to an incubation on ice for 45 min. Cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 100 μL of FACS buffer containing antibodies CD34, and α7-integrin, as well as streptavidin-PE-Cy7. Cells were incubated in the dark for 90 min on ice, with agitation occurring every 30 min. FACS buffer was added up to 1 mL final volume, and cells pelleted and resuspended in FACS buffer, and the viability dye 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD) was added (final concentration 4 mg/mL). Cells were placed in falcon tubes with cell strainers before collection by FACS. Murine MuSCs were identified as CD11b−/CD31−/CD45−/Sca1−/α7-Integrin+/CD34+. Primary human MuSCs were provided as described (Tichy et al., 2017). Briefly, human calf muscle biopsies were enzymatically dissociated in 0.2% collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.02 units/mL dispase (Roche) for 45 min at 37°C, minced under a dissection microscope and incubated for an additional 45 min at 37°C. The resulting cell suspension was filtered through a 70 μm cell strainer and incubated with biotinylated anti-human CD45, CD11b and CD31. Samples were washed with FACS buffer and incubated with anti-NCAM/CD56 and Streptavidin APC-Cy7. Human MuSCs were CD11b−/CD31−/CD45−/NCAM+. Muscle isolation and sectioning Tibialis Anterior muscles were dissected and fixed in 4% PFA/PBS and incubated overnight in 30% sucrose prior to being embedded in OCT medium (Richard Allen Scientific) and frozen in chilled 2-methylbutane. Cryosections were cut at a thickness of 10 μm and placed on Superfrost plus slides. Sections were stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin. More specifically, slides were stained with Hematoxylin for 1min, rinsed in water, and incubated with acidic alcohol (1% hydrochloric acid in 100% ethanol). After rinsing in water, slides were immersed in bluing, water, and 70% ethanol for 30sec each. Next, slides were exposed to eosin for 1min and gradually dehydrated with a graduated ethanol series. After a final incubation in xylene, coverslips were mounted with Cytoseal-xyl. Sections were imaged on a Nikon Ni widefield epifluorescence microscope. Muscle fiber areas were manually determined using ImageJ/Fiji. For Masson’s trichrome staining, tissue cryosections were fixed with Bouin’s solution overnight, rinsed with water, and incubated with Weigert’s Hematoxylin staining reagent (Electron Microscopy Sciences) for 5 min. Slides were washed with water for 10 min and stained with a commercially available kit (Sigma Aldrich). Briefly, slides were first stained with Biebrich Scarlet-Acid Fuchsin Solution (Sigma Aldrich) for 5 min, rinsed in three changes of water, followed by staining with phosphotungstic/phosphomolybdic acid solution (Sigma Aldrich) for 10 min. Slides were then stained with aniline blue solution (Sigma Aldrich) for 5min to stain collagen in blue, differentiated with 1% glacial acetic acid for 2min, and then dehydrated with an ascending series of ethyl alcohol followed by xylene before they were mounted. Sections were imaged under the same conditions and intensities using a Nikon Ni widefield epifluorescence microscope with an objective lens magnification at 20×. Analysis of fibrotic area was conducted in Fiji software, using color deconvolution and thresholding function to define the areas of collagen and the muscle fiber. The fibrotic area percentage is calculated as (collagen area/muscle fiber area) × 100. Telomere length analysis of FACS isolated MuSCs (MuQ-FISH) Telomere length was measured using quantitative fluorescentin situhybridization of Cy3-conjugated PNA telomere probe (Tel-C, PNA probe). MuSCs were isolated and processed for telomere length measurements as previously described (Tichy et al., 2017). MuSCs were imaged using a Nikon eclipse 90i wide-field epifluorescence microscope equipped with a Prior Proscan III motorized stage, a Photometrics Coolsnap HQ2 14-bit digital camera and a Nikon 100x/1.40 Plan Apo VC objective. Initially, control samples are imaged to determine each channel’s exposure time in a way that situates the intensities for all samples in the mid-intensity range. This control prevents overexposure or loss of signal detection with the selected exposure times during sample imaging. Once an optimal exposure time is defined, image acquisition is utilized at the same exposure settings for the telomere and DAPI or centromeric signals for imaging of individual experiments. For each experiment, the intensity settings are not changed between sample groups. Images are taken without binning. Imaging must take place in the same time window for each experiment, and combination of multiple experiments performed at different days is not recommended, due to the inherent caveat of fluorescent intensity measurements differing between experiments. Telomere length was assessed as the total sum or mean telomeric probe intensity divided by the sum intensity of either the DAPI or the centromeric signal. Unbiased analysis with the investigators blinded to genotypes and/or conditions was conducted using the ImageJ plug-in Telometer. Telomere length analysis of tissues sections PFA-fixed cryosections were permeabilized for 10min with 0.5% Triton X-100, washed with PBS, and underwent heat-mediated antigen retrieval with TET buffer (10mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.05% Tween-20). Sections were incubated with Tel C-Alexa Fluor 647 and CENPB-Cy3 (PNA bio, 1/600) in QFISH cryo-buffer (15% ethylene carbonate, 20% dextran sulfate, 600mM NaCl, 0.1% citric acid-based antigen retrieval buffer). Probe in buffer was added to slides, covered with a coverslip, and QFISH was carried out using a Thermobrite programmable slide warmer (Leica): 10min prehybridization step at 67°C, followed by 90min hybridization at 42C. Afterward, slides were washed twice, 5min each in buffers with decreasing salt concentrations at 55°C (2X SSC/0.1% Tween 20, 1X SSC/0.1% Tween 20, 0.5X SSC/0.1% Tween 20, 0.25X SSC/0.1% Tween 20). Slides were rinsed with PBS, blocked with 1% BSA/0.1% Triton X-100/1X PBS for 1hr at room temperature. Antibody to VCAM (ThermoFisher, 1/100) was added to the blocking buffer and slides were incubated overnight at 4°C. The following day, slides were washed with PBS and stained with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated Donkey anti-goat IgG antibody (ThermoFisher) in blocking buffer for 1hr at room temperature. Slides were washed with PBS and coverslips were mounted with Prolong gold plus DAPI. Cryosections were imaged with a Nikon Ni widefield epifluorescence microscope equipped with a 100x Plan Apo objective and Nikon elements software. Analysis of telomere length was assessed with the investigators blinded to genotypes and/or conditions in VCAM+cells using Telometer. At least 40 cells per mouse were analyzed. Mice were inverted on a cross-hatched metal platform and the time required for mice to release themselves from the platform was quantified. Three repetition measurements were recorded per mouse, giving the mouse 1hr rest in between measurements. Blood was collected from mice by cardiac puncture and allowed to clot. After centrifugation for 10min at 600×g, serum was diluted 1/10 with PBS and assayed and analyzed using a commercially available kit (Sekisui Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Quantitative real time-PCR (qRT-PCR) RNA was isolated from FACS-sorted MuSCs using a RNeasy Plus micro kit (QIAGEN), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA was generated with the Protoscript II First Strand cDNA synthesis kit (New England Biolabs). qRT-PCR was carried out on a Quantstudio 6 instrument (Applied Biosystems) using Taqman primers and Taqman Universal PCR Master Mix. Reactions were carried out in triplicate with at least three mice analyzed per experiment. Gene expression was determined using the ΔΔCt method. Primers purchased from Applied Biosystems and included IKBKB-FAM (Gene assay ID: Mm01222247_m1), CHUK-FAM (Mm00432529_m1), IKBKG-FAM (Mm00494927_m1), XRCC5-FAM (Mm00550142_m1), XRCC6-FAM (Mm00487458_m1), TERF2-FAM (Mm01253555_m1), TERF1-FAM (Mm00436928_m1), TERF2IP-FAM (Mm01243676_m1), TPP1-FAM (Mm00487016_m1), TINF2-FAM (Mm00461166_g1), Pot1B-FAM (Mm01278790_m1), Tert-FAM (Mm00436931_m1), and GAPDH-VIC (4352339e). In silicoanalysis of putative p65 binding sites in promoters The potential of the p65 transcription factor to bind to selected murine gene promoters was analyzed using the Lasagna tool (https://biogrid.engr.uconn.edu/lasagna_search/) with the following conditions: using the transfac model, search range of −2000 to 0, p less than or equal to 0.001. Displayed are the Telomere-induced foci (TIF) assay For chronic injury assessment, mice were injured in the Tibialis Anterior muscle with 10uL of 10ug/mL notexin weekly, for three times and harvested 3 days after the last injury. For dystrophic models, mice were injured once and harvested 3 days post-injury. 10 μm cryosections were stained as described in “telomere length analysis in tissue sections” above using a Tel-C Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated probe (PNA bio). After staining and processing, slides were blocked for 2 hours at room temperature with 3% BSA in PBS, followed by overnight incubation at 4°C with antibody to VCAM (1/100 of 1 μg/μL stock ThermoFisher) and 53BP1 (1/2000, Novus Biologicals). Slides were rinsed in PBS and incubated with donkey anti-goat Alexa fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (1/300) for 1 hour at room temperature. Slides were washed with PBS three times before mounting coverslips with prolong gold with DAPI. For imaging, 1 μm slices were captured with a Zeiss Confocal 710 microscope with Zen software. TIFs were defined as 53BP1 foci overlapping or contacting telomere foci. For TIF assessment of human-derived MuSCs, cells were plated on collagen-coated chamber slides and stained with TelC-Alexa 647 PNA probe (according to Telomere Length Analysis of FACS Isolated MuSCs (MuQ-FISH) above). Slides were blocked with 3% BSA in PBS for 1 hour and stained with 53BP1 antibody (1/2000) overnight at 4°C, followed by staining with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 hour at room temperature. Coverslips were mounted with fluoromount G with DAPI (Southern Biotech). Cells were imaged on a Nikon widefield epifluorescence microscope and quantitated for TIFs. Human-derived MuSCs were plated in collagen-coated 96-well optical bottom plates in equal numbers, fixed in 4% PFA/PBS, permeabilized with 1% IGEPAL CA-630, blocked in 10% goat serum/1% BSA/PBS and stained with antibody against phospho-p65 serine 536 (1/100; Abcam) overnight at 4°C. Cells were washed with PBS and stained with Dylight 800 goat anti-rabbit (1/1,000; Rockland) and DNA was stained with DRAQ5 (1/5,000; Biolegend). Signal intensities were measured on an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System, with Image Studio software. Antibody intensity to nuclear intensity ratios were analyzed to normalize for cell content/growth differences. Imaging using two-photon microscopy To define MuSC number in their endogenous environment, Control (Pax7EGFP) and genetically modified mice bred to Pax7EGFP mice were injured 3X with notexin, starting around 3 months of age, and allowed to recover for ~10 weeks. TA muscles were collected, fixed in 4% PFA/PBS and rinsed in PBS. Muscles were mounted on a custom-made chamber and high-resolution serial sections were collected from the middle of the muscle, using a Leica SP* Confocal/Multiphoton Microscope system equipped with a Chameleon Vision II Sapphire laser. A 910 nm laser was focused through a 20x HCX APO L Lens. Emission light was collected with a FITC (BP 525/50) filter, and muscle fibers were marked via second-generation harmonics. Serial optical sections were collected every 1.5 μm, flattened, and normalized to volume scanned. Each mouse was scannedin vivousing a preclinical μCT system (vivaCT 40, Scanco Medical AG, Brüttisellen, Switzerland) at 38μm nominal voxel size. The scanner was used at 55kVp energy and 145μA intensity. Images were generated with an integration time of 200ms and 1 signal average. During the scans, mice were anesthetized using 1%–1.5% isoflurane in 1–1.5mL/min of oxygen. The mouse was immobilized using a customized holder to ensure minimal motion. Before each scan, a 2D scout view was used to select the scan region. The average scan time was approximately 50min. Myoblast culture and shRNA knockdown C2C12 myoblast cells were grown in DMEM high glucose supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1X antibiotic/antimycotic, 1X Glutamax, and 1X nonessential amino acids. Equal numbers of cells were plated at low density (3×104cells/well) into 24 well plates and transfected with shRNA vectors using lipofectamine 3000, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Vectors used were shEMPTY (pLKO1.puro empty; Addgene plasmid 8453), mouse XRCC5–1 (Sigma SHCLNG-NM_009533; TRCN000031295), mouse XRCC5–2 (Sigma SHCLNG-NM_009533; TRCN0000071044). Transfected cells were re-plated in 8 well chamber slides 24 hours post-transfection, cultured a further 24 hours, and either subjected to MuQ-FISH or stained with antibody to Ku80 (Santa Cruz, B4, Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated) and imaged. Data were generated from 3 independently transfected wells which were stained, imaged and analyzed at the same end points. Analysis of nuclear Ku80 expression was determined using a semi-automated protocol in ImageJ. Muscle contractility was tested at the Penn Muscle Institute Muscle Physiology Assessment Core of the University of Pennsylvania. Eccentrics (ECCs) were assessed on freshly isolated EDL muscles using an Aurora Mouse 1200A System equipped with Dynamic Muscle Control v.5.5 software. EDL muscles were maintained in constantly oxygenated Ringer’s solution (100mM NaCl, 4.7mM KCl, 3.4mM CaCl2, 1.2mM KH2PO4, 1.2mM MgSO4, 25mM HEPES and 5.5mM D-glucose) at 24 C. Briefly, a series of two ECCs was applied using a tetanic stimulation of 80Hz and stretching the muscle by 10% of L0 over 200ms. The force drop was calculated as the percent of the force at the initial ECC.
