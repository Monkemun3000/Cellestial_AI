The proline-rich extensin-like receptor kinase (PERK) gene family is crucial to various molecular and cellular processes in plants. We identified 50PERKgenes inBrassica napusto explore their evolutionary dynamics, structural diversity, and functional roles. These genes were grouped into four classes and unevenly distributed across 18 chromosomes. Phylogenetic studies and Ka/Ks ratios revealed purifying selection during the evolution process. They exhibited significant diversification in gene length, molecular weight, and isoelectric points, suggesting specialized function. Gene structure and motif analyses revealed variations among theBnPERKfamily members, with conserved tyrosine kinase domains suggesting functional importance.Cis-element analysis predicted the involvement in hormone signaling and stress responses. Expression profiling showed diverse patterns across tissues and hormone treatments, highlighting potential roles in growth regulation and hormone signaling. Protein–protein interaction networks suggested BnPERK proteins interact with a wide array of proteins, implicating them in multiple biological processes. The transcriptional downregulation of fourBnPERKgenes uponPlasmodiophora brassicaeinfection implied a role in clubroot disease response. Furthermore, the Arabidopsisperk9mutant displayed relieved disease severity and enhanced basal immune response, suggesting the negative role ofPERK9in plant immunity. The study highlighted the potential role ofBnPERKsin crop improvement strategies against clubroot disease. Receptor-like kinases (RLKs) constitute the largest plant receptor family and are located on the cell surface to perceive and transduce a wide range of signals [1]. By initiating intracellular signaling cascades, RLKs play pivotal roles in various molecular and cellular processes, including plant development, stress response, and signal transduction [2]. These versatile receptors are capable of sensing plant hormones, secreted peptides, and molecules derived from pathogens involved in plant defense response [3]. For example, RLKs recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), which trigger the Pattern-Triggered Immunity (PTI) response, activating signaling pathways that defend against pathogen invasion. RLKs typically consist of three key domains: an extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular kinase domain [4]. The extracellular domain, characterized by significant structural diversity, forms the basis for classifying RLKs into different subclasses based on their motif structures. Among these, the proline-rich extensin-like receptor kinases (PERKs) represent a distinct group characterized by a proline-rich extracellular domain [5]. Interestingly, while somePERKslikeBnPERK1andAtPERK4locate on the plasma membrane,AtPERK13has been demonstrated to anchor to the cell wall [6,7,8,9]. Functionally, the intracellular kinase domain of RLKs contains conserved motifs that exhibit kinase activity, which has been observed inBnPERK1andAtPERK4[7,10]. InArabidopsis thaliana, thePERKgene family consists of 15 members, some of which show specific expression patterns in roots and floral organs [11]. However, someAtPERKgenes exhibit broad expression patterns across various tissues, such asAtPERK1,which is ubiquitously expressed, suggesting its involvement in diverse molecular and cellular processes. Recent studies have elucidated the regulation ofPERKsin response to different stress conditions [5]. For example, the expression ofTaPERKsin wheat andGhPERKsin cotton is significantly influenced by abiotic stresses such as heat, drought, and salinity [12,13]. InA. thaliana,AtPERK13has been shown to respond to nutrient deficiencies such as phosphate, nitrogen, and iron deprivation, highlighting the role ofPERKsin maintaining nutrient homeostasis and adaptation [9]. In rice, thePERKgene Z15 is activated by moderately low temperatures, emphasizing the adaptability ofPERKsto diverse environmental cues [14]. Additionally,PERKshave been implicated in plant defense against pathogens. For example, the expression ofTaPERKsis influenced by fungal pathogens, andBnPERK1has been shown to respond to the pathogenSclerotinia sclerotiorum[7,12,15]. In summary,PERKsare versatile players in response to various stresses. PERKsalso play essential roles in plant hormone signaling. Several studies have highlighted the involvement ofPERKsin the regulation of growth and development in response to hormonal signals [10,13,16]. For instance,AtPERK4has been implicated in abscisic acid (ABA) signaling during root cell elongation [10]. Furthermore, the expression profiles ofOsPERKsandGhPERKshave shown differential expression patterns under different plant hormone treatments, including ABA, methyl jasmona (MeJA), gibberellin (GA), salicylic acid (SA), and auxin [13,16]. The intricate regulation ofPERKsby different plant hormones suggests their pivotal role in integrating hormonal signaling pathways to coordinate plant growth and stress responses. In summary,PERKgenes are known to be critical to plant growth, development, and stress responses. Despite the essential roles ofPERKsin various processes across various plant species, comprehensive studies on thePERKgene family inBrassica napus(oilseed rape), an economically important crop serving as both an edible oil source and animal feed, are still limited [17]. This allopolyploid species (AACC, 2n = 38), formed by the hybridization between two diploid ancestors,B. rapa(AA = 20) andB. oleracea(CC = 18), emerged approximately 6800 to 12,500 years ago [18]. While a comprehensive study ofBrPERKgenes has been completed in male-sterileB. rapaplants, identifying 25BrPERKgenes and exploring their potential role in male sterility, studies inB. napusremain scarce [19]. This study aimed to provide a comprehensive study ofBnPERKgenes to include the exploration of its evolutionary history, chromosome location, and gene structure through various computational approaches. Tissue-specific and hormone treatment gene expression patterns were examined using available transcriptome datasets. Additionally, the study also investigated the role ofBnPERKsin response to the obligate pathogenPlasmodiophora brassicae,which causes clubroot disease inBrassicaspecies. By providing insights into the molecular and functional roles ofBnPERKs, this study will contribute to a deeper understanding of this often-overlooked plant receptor subfamily and its potential applications in crop improvement. 2.1. Identification and Phylogenetic Analysis of BnPERKs in Brassica napus Phylogenetic tree of thePERKgene family inB. napusandA. thaliana. The phylogenetic tree was constructed with 50 BnPERK protein sequences and 15 AtPERK protein sequences by MEGA11 using the maximum likelihood (ML) method. A total of 15 paralogs were identified, grouped into 15 distinct clusters, each represented by a different color (PERK1 to PERK15). Based on sequence similarity and functional domain analysis, the 15 paralogs were further categorized into four major groups, which are indicated by distinct colors (outer lane). Group I, light steel blue; Group II, cornflower blue; Group III, royal blue; Group IV, black. 2.2.

The heatmap shows the expression of 50BnPERKgenes across 14 different tissues, processed with log2normalization. The color gradient ranges from blue (indicating lower expression levels) to red (indicating higher expression levels), while the gray spots represent no detectable expression. Furthermore, some paralogous gene pairs, such asBnPERK01A1/BnPERK01C1andBnPERK09A1/BnPERK09C1, showed similar expression patterns, being constitutively and highly expressed across all tested tissues. In contrast, other paralogous gene pairs, likeBnPERK06A1/BnPERK06A2andBnPERK06C1/BnPERK06C2, showed specific high expression in floral organs. Additionally,BnPERK15A4/BnPERK15C3showed high expression levels in different tissues, except for pollen. However, some paralogous gene pairs exhibited distinct patterns, indicating functional divergence. 2.5.

(D) Expression patterns ofPERK9,PR2, PR5,andRBOHDgenes in Col-0 andperk9lines. Different letters represent significant differences (p< 0.05). Furthermore, the expression levels ofPERK9,PR2,PR5,andRBOHDwere evaluated in Col-0 andperk9lines at 14 days afterP. brassicaeinoculation.PERK9also showed downregulated expression in response toP. brassicaein Col-0, while it was totally inhibited inperk9. The expressions ofPR2,PR5, andRBOHDgenes were greatly enhanced inperk9.PR2andRBOHDnot only could be induced in Col-0 afterP. brassicaeinoculation, but also inperk9. Enhanced disease resistance to clubroot disease and increased expression of these genes inperk9indicated that the basal immune response was triggered by the knockout ofPERK9. PERKs constitute a crucial subfamily of RLKs that play important roles in various molecular and cellular processes in plants, including development, signaling, and stress responses [5]. Despite their significance, there remains a lack of comprehensive study on the molecular functions of PERKs, particularly when compared with other RLKs. While genome-wide analyses ofPERKgenes have been conducted in some species [11,12,13,16,19], a thorough study of theBnPERKgene family has yet to be published. Therefore, this study systematically analyzedBnPERKgenes, covering various aspects. 3.1. Deciphering the Evolutionary Dynamics of the BnPERK Genes Initially, it was expected that eachArabidopsisgene would have six homologs inB. napusdue to two recent duplication events. However, only 50BnPERKgenes were identified, suggesting a loss of duplicatedBnPERKgenes followingBrassicagenome triplication and hybridization. This indicated that gene loss was a crucial process during genomic arrangements and chromosome doubling [23]. This also implied a selective process, where functionally redundantBnPERKcopies may have been lost, while the retained 50BnPERKgenes may be crucial for plant development, hormone signaling, and stress response. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that mostAtPERKgenes corresponded to 2–6 orthologous genes inB. napus, each of which included orthologs from both the A and C subgenomes. However, someAtPERKgenes showed variations in the number of corresponding orthologous genes from the A and C subgenomes, suggesting extensive chromosomal rearrangements and asymmetric gene loss within duplicated genomic blocks [17]. Analysis of Ka/Ks ratios of paralogous gene pairs indicated purifying selection on duplicatedBnPERKgenes, implying their functional conservation and evolutionary constraint at these loci [24]. Understanding the evolutionary dynamics of theBnPERKgene family not only enriches our knowledge of rapeseed genetics but also has broader implications for research in plant biology and stress-response mechanisms. 3.2. Exploring the Structural Diversity and Functional Roles of BnPERKs TheBnPERKgene family exhibited significant structural diversity, including variations in gene length, molecular weight, and isoelectric points. These variations suggested potential functional specialization within the gene family [25]. Although functional studies ofBnPERKsare limited, expression profiling can still provide valuable insights about the gene’s function and its role in different biological processes [26]. In accordance with the result inA. thaliana,BnPERKfamily members exhibited two distinct expression patterns: some were highly expressed in pollen, while others had broader expression patterns [11]. Constitutive expression of certainBnPERKgenes indicated their essential roles in fundamental cellular functions, while someBnPERKsexhibited higher expression levels in floral organs, which is consistent with findings in other species likeA. thaliana,B. rapa,Triticum aestivum, andOryza sativaand indicates their importance in floral development [11,12,16,19]. Specifically, 18 orthologs ofAtPERK5,AtPERK6,AtPERK7,andAtPERK12were notably expressed in pollen, among whichAtPERK5andAtPERK12were shown to be essential for pollen tube growth [11,27]. Furthermore, certainB. rapagenes (orthologs ofAtPERK6andAtPERK12) were associated with male sterility, as they were downregulated in male-sterile mutants [19].BnPERK01A1andBnPERK01C1(orthologs ofAtPERK1) showed constitutively high expression, suggesting essential roles in fundamental cellular functions. Functional analysis ofBnPERK1indicated its role in regulating cell wall integrity, signaling in stress responses, and facilitating growth and development inArabidopsis[15]. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that theBnPERKgenes originated through segmental duplication [28]. Structural examination confirmed the phylogenetic arrangement, with mostBnPERKgenes sharing conserved motifs and tyrosine kinase domains. Differences in gene structure andcis-acting regulatory elements in promoters suggested evolutionary divergence, which may contribute to functional diversity and evolutionary mechanisms [29]. Analysis of thecis-element indicated thatBnPERKgenes were responsive to various stresses and hormone signaling pathways, with MeJA- and ABA-responsive elements being particularly abundant. This suggests thatBnPERKgenes could mediate diverse gene expression patterns and provide flexibility in stress responses [30]. Further study on the expression patterns ofBnPERKgenes in response to hormone treatments provided insights into their potential roles in hormone signaling and plant development. This rapid and robust response to IAA, ET, GA, CK, and BL suggested thatBnPERKgenes might play a crucial role in the early stages of hormonal signal transduction in leaves, possibly by mediating the downstream effects of these hormones. In contrast, the expression profiles in roots exhibited totally different expression patterns, which highlights the complexity and specificity of hormonal regulation in different tissues. Enhanced expression levels after GA and ABA treatments in roots suggest involvements in root growth and stress adaptation [31,32]. The contrasting expression patterns after MeJA treatment in roots and leaves imply distinct roles in different tissues. Additionally, the observation that genes such asBnPERK09A1,BnPERK09C1, andBnPERK04C1were induced in both leaves and roots after IAA treatment implies a role in auxin signaling, which is central to various developmental processes, including cell elongation and differentiation [33]. These genes may act as intermediaries in auxin signal transduction pathways, influencing growth and development in a tissue-specific manner. In summary, the comprehensive examination illuminates the structural diversity and functional implications of theBnPERKgene family. The differential expression patterns ofBnPERKgenes in response to various hormone treatments highlight their potential involvement in diverse physiological processes, including growth regulation, stress responses, and defense mechanisms. 3.3. Revealing the Role of BnPERK in Clubroot Disease Recent studies have suggested that receptor-like kinases (RLKs) including PERKs are involved in plant–pathogen interactions and immune responses [2,3,4]. Analysis ofcis-elements and expression profiles suggested thatBnPERKsmay act as novel sensors for various stresses, particularly plant pathogen infections [5,12]. Protein–protein interaction network analysis supported this result, revealing the multifunctionality of BnPERK proteins and emphasizing their broad participation in plant physiological processes specific to plant disease response [34]. The interactions involved cell wall organization, plant–pathogen interactions, plasma membrane dynamics, endomembrane activities, MAPK signaling pathways, and starch/sucrose metabolism. Given that pathogen-induced changes in cell walls affected disease resistance, it is possible thatBnPERKsdetect these alterations and initiate responses to maintain cell wall integrity [35]. The membrane localization ofBnPERKssuggested they might perceive infection signals at the cell’s surface. Upon activation by cell wall components,BnPERKslikely trigger downstream signaling cascades, including MAPK pathways [36]. Otherwise, MAPK pathways also acted as downstream signaling components of hormones and played important roles in plant responses to different stresses [37]. Despite these insights, the exact role ofBnPERKsin plant immunity remains largely unknown, and their interactions with RLKs or coreceptors remain largely unexplored. Clubroot disease, caused by the obligate parasiteP. brassicae, poses a significant threat to Brassicaceae plants [38]. The parasite is dependent on plant-derived sugars as a carbon source for colonization [39,40]. The enriched sugar metabolism reflects the altered homeostasis and increased demand for sugar in infected plants. However, the downstream signaling components and their regulation in response toP. brassicaeinfection are not yet clear. ThePERKgene family, with its known functions in cell wall integrity and stress responses, may contribute to reinforcing the plant cell wall during pathogen infection or modulating defense-related signaling pathways [5]. Given the role ofPERKsin disease response, the involvement of thePERKgene family inB. napusin clubroot disease was as expected. The transcriptional downregulation ofBnPERK09A1,BnPERK09C1,BnPERK14A1, andBnPERK06C2uponP. brassicaeinfection suggests their putative roles in clubroot disease response. In accordance with the result inB. napus, the expression ofAtPERK9was also downregulated in response toP. brassicae. Theperk9mutant was used for clubroot disease investigation, indicating the roles ofBnPERK09A1andBnPERK09C1in the disease resistance. Pathogenesis-related proteins including enzymes like β-1,3-glucanase (PR2) and thionins (PR5), which have antimicrobial activity and are involved in the basal immune response [41]. TheRBOHD(Respiratory burst oxidase homolog D) gene is crucial in generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) as part of the plant immune system [42]. The increased expression of these genes suggested that the knockout ofAtPERK9triggered the basal immune response, resulting in increased disease resistance inperk9.The induction ofPR2andRBOHDin both Col-0 andperk9after inoculation suggested that basal immune response occurred in susceptible Col-0. Furthermore, the induction ofBnPERK09A1andBnPERK09C1by IAA treatment was also particularly intriguing, as IAA is known to act as a signaling molecule potentially involved in the response toP. brassicaeinfection [43,44,45]. However, the exact roles ofBnPERK09A1andBnPERK09C1need further function study. The predicted interaction proteins associated with these pathways implied their roles in mediating the interaction betweenB. napusandP. brassicae, providing targets for further functional characterization. In summary, uncovering the role ofBnPERKsin clubroot disease response provided valuable insights into plant–pathogen interactions and potential strategies for disease management. 4.1. Identification of BnPERK Genes in Brassica napus TheBnPERKgene family was selected in this study due to its critical role in plant growth, development, and stress responses. It has not been extensively studied inB. napus, making it a valuable target for genome-wide analysis. The genomic data and annotation for theB. napuscultivar ‘ZS11’ were sourced fromB. napusmulti-omics information resource (BnIR) (https://yanglab.hzau.edu.cn/BnIR, accessed on 1 March 2024) [46]. ThePERKgenes inB. napuswere identified using BLASTp (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) with an E-value threshold of 10−5, employing the protein sequence of 15 AtPERKs as queries [11]. TheBnPERKgene family members were named based on their orthologous relationships and chromosomal location. By searching the conserved domain in InterPro (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro, accessed on 5 March 2024) and the NCBI Conserved Domain Database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/wrpsb.cgi, accessed on 5 March 2024), the tyrosine kinase domain-containing protein sequences were verified for candidateBnPERKgenes. Additionally, Expasy (https://web.expasy.org/protparam, accessed on 8 March 2024) was utilized to assess the isoelectric points (pIs) and the molecular weights (MWs) of BnPERK proteins. Subcellular locations of these proteins were predicted using Euk-mPLoc [47] (http://www.csbio.sjtu.edu.cn/bioinf/euk-multi-2, accessed on8 March 2024). 4.2. Chromosomal Location, Gene Duplication, and Phylogenetic Analysis The positions of theBnPERKgenes on the chromosomes were obtained from the annotation of theB. napusgenome. McScanX (https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/software/mcscanx) was employed to detect the duplication patterns, including segmental and tandem duplication [48]. Visualization of chromosomal distribution and duplication events was represented using Circos (Vers. 0.69-9) software [49]. The Ka/Ks (nonsynonymous substitution rate to synonymous substitution rate) ratio was calculated for the paralogous gene pairs using ParaAT2.0 [50]. Collinearity analysis ofBnPERKgenes was conducted and displayed using TBtools (Vers. 2.056) [51]. A phylogenetic tree was generated using MEGA 11 [52] through neighbor-joining method with 1000 bootstrap replications and visualized using iTol (https://itol.embl.de, accessed on 11 March 2024). 4.3. Gene Structure, Conserved Motifs, and Cis-Elements Analysis The exon–intron structure ofPERKgenes was examined using Gene Structure Display Server 2.0 (https://gsds.gao-lab.org/index.php/accessed on 14 March 2024). Conserved motifs were predicted using Multiple Expectation Maximization for Motif Elicitation (https://meme-suite.org/meme/tools/meme, accessed on 14 March 2024). The sequences of 2 Kb upstream from the start codon of 50BnPERKgenes were extracted from theB. napus‘ZS11’ genome and analyzed forcis-elements using PlantCARE [53] (http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/plantcare/html, accessed on 14 March 2024) to predictcis-elements. The data were visualized using TBtools (Vers. 2.056) [51]. 4.4. Expression Profiles of BnPERK Genes in Different Tissues and Under Hormone Treatments To display different expression profiles, RNA-Seq data from various tissues and the hormone response ofB. napuscultivar ‘ZS11’ were obtained from BnIR. A total of 14 tissues at different development stages included seed, leaf, bud, root, petal, sepal, pollen, silique, filament, cotyledon, lower stem peel, middle stem peel, upper stem peel, and vegetative rosette stages. The roots and leaves were treated with hormones (IAA, auxin; ACC, l-aminocyclopropane-l-carboxylic acid; GA, gibberellin acid; ABA, abscisic acid; TZ, trans-zeatin; JA, methyl jasmonate; BL, brassinolide) and sampled at 0.5, 1, 3, and 6 h after treatment. Heatmaps were generated using these expression values after logarithmic transformed RPKM values and displayed using TBtools (Vers. 2.056) [51]. 4.5. Network-Based Prediction of Protein Interactions Analysis of the protein–protein interaction network inB. napuswas predicted using STRING (https://cn.string-db.org/, accessed on 15 March 2024), and the interactions were displayed using Cytoscape (Vers. 3.9.1) [54]. In order to investigate the biological process involvingB. napusgenes, the putative interacted genes based on Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were conducted by BnaOmics [55] (https://bnaomics.ocri-genomics.net/tools/enrich/, accessed on 15 March 2024). 4.6. Plasmodiophora Brassicae Inoculation, Clubroot Disease Investigation, and Histocytological Analysis A collection ofPlasmodiophora brassicaeisolate from Zhijiang, Hubei, was used for inoculation in greenhouse. The seeds ofB. napuscultivar ‘ZS11’, wild-typeA. thaliana(Col-0), andAtPERK9mutant were germinated in a greenhouse maintained at 24 °C under a 16/8 h light/dark photoperiod. Seven-day-old rapeseed seedlings were inoculated with resting spores ofP. brassicaeat a concentration of 10−6spores/mL [56]. Two-week-oldArabidopsisseedlings were inoculated at a concentration of 10−5spores/mL. The clubroot disease was investigated and photographed at 28–35 days after inoculation. The disease index was assessed using the following 0–3 scoring system: 0 refers to healthy roots; 1 refers to small galls on lateral roots only; 2 refers to small and medium galls covering the main root and a few lateral roots; 3 indicates large galls on the main root. The disease index (DI) was calculated according to the following formula: DI = 100 × (1 × N1+ 2 × N2+ 3 × N3)/3 × Nt. N1to N3refer to the number of plants in the indicated class, and Ntis the total number of plants tested. The progression of cortex infection byP. brassicaewas studied. Approximately 0.5 cm long root segments were excised from the upper of the primary root. Following standard protocols for fixation and dehydration, the samples were embedded in paraffin and sectioned at a thickness of 5–8 μM. Sections were analyzed and photographed using an optical microscope. 4.7. Transcriptome Analysis of BnPERK Genes in B. napus During Clubroot Disease Root samples ofB. napusinfected withP. brassicaeand uninfected controls were harvested at 14 days after treatment for RNA-Seq analysis. After sequencing and quality control, bioinformatics pipelines were using to clean raw sequencing data by removing adapters and low-quality reads. Then, the clean reads were aligned to the genome of ‘ZS11’. Gene expression levels were estimated using logarithmic transformed FPKM values. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between infected and control samples were determined with the DEGseq2 (adjustedp< 0.05 and |log2(fold-change)| ≥ 1) and displayed using TBtools (Vers. 2.056). 4.8. qRT-PCR Analysis of Pathogenesis-Related (PR) Genes in A. thaliana The study emphasized the evolutionary dynamics, structural diversity, and functional roles of theBnPERKgene family. It suggested thatBnPERKgenes are involved in various physiological processes, including growth regulation, stress responses, and the defense against pathogens. The transcriptional downregulation ofBnPERK09A1andBnPERK09C1uponP. brassicaeinfection and the potential involvement of these genes in clubroot disease response further emphasize their significance in plant immunity. The identification ofBnPERK09A1andBnPERK09C1as potential targets for disease management strategies and their putative role in signaling networks could contribute to the resistance improvement of Brassicaceae crops.
