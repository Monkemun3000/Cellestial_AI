Plants undergosubstantial physiological adaptation to accommodate changing environments. As sessile organisms, plants have developed exquisitely sensitive metabolisms that can provide insights into how eukaryotes sense and respond to external stimuli. Spaceflight presents unique challenges to terrestrial organisms. The microgravity environment in itself is outside the evolutionary experience of any terrestrial organism, but the absence of gravity also impacts the physical environment inherent to the unique living space of orbital vehicles (Musgraveet al.,1997; Wolffet al.,2013). It is now well established that plants grown in orbital vehicles exhibit significant changes in gene expression as part of the physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment (Linket al.,2001; Paulet al.,2001,2005,2012b,2013; Stutteet al.,2006; Salmi and Roux,2008; Salmiet al.,2011; Correllet al.,2013; Nasiret al.,2014; Sugimotoet al.,2014). However, studies approaching plant adaptation to spaceflight at the level of the proteome have been limited. To date, the only true proteomic-scale study of plants in space has been a label-free analysis of membrane proteins isolated from Arabidopsis seedlings grown on the International Space Station (ISS) (Mazarset al.,2014). The distribution of differentially abundant proteins among three treatments (microgravity of the ISS, a 1gorbital centrifuge, and a 1gground control) highlights familiar pathways in gravity signal transduction. Many of the membrane-associated proteins involved in auxin signaling cascades were less prominent in microgravity-grown plants, while many proteins typically associated with stress responses were more abundant. While there is not a one-to-one correlation with any gene set from a published spaceflight transcriptome, similar trends in the differential expression of genes important to auxin metabolism, and to a variety of stress responses, can be seen in the transcription profiles from several studies (see citations above). A proteomic survey in terrestrial altered-gravity environments also revealed a host of general stress proteins as well as those associated with auxin signaling (Tanet al.,2011). Although there is little specific overlap with transcriptome studies of plants exposed to similar environments, many of the trends in pathways affected by spaceflight are similar among the studies (Moseykoet al.,2002; Tanet al.,2011). With increased technical sensitivity and better access to space, the spaceflight responses contribute to a comprehensive picture of the strategies used by plants to cope with changes in their environment. 2.1. Plant growth and harvest on the ISS The data presented here are from plants harvested during one of several experiments launched to the ISS on STS-129, November 16, 2009 (specifically, Run 1B: 12/3/2009–12/15/2009), and returned on STS-130, February 8, 2010. Arabidopsis seeds were planted aseptically on the surface of 10 cm2solid media plates (Paulet al.,2004). The samples come from a collection of three Arabidopsis lines. The three GFP [green fluorescent protein (Sheenet al.,1995)] reporter gene lines were Adh::GFP [alcohol dehydrogenase promoter (Manaket al.,2002)]; DR5r::GFP [synthetic auxin response element composed of five AuxRE elements; gift of T. Guilfoyle (Ulmasovet al.,1997)]; and 35s::GFP [driven by the CaMV35s promoter (Manaket al.,2002)]. Seeds and seeded plates were prepared in such a way as to maintain dormancy in light-tight coverings until the initiation of the experiment on orbit (Paulet al.,2012a). The plated seeds remained dormant until activated by exposure to light on the ISS, which initiated germination. Both the flight plates and ground control plates were grown in the Advanced Biological Research System, ABRS (NASA,2011a; Paulet al.,2012a,2013). The ABRS provided temperature control, light control, and circulation of air that was scrubbed to remove volatile organic compounds. On orbit, the dormant seeded plates were unwrapped from their coverings and installed in the GFP Imaging System (GIS) (Fig. 1A), which was then inserted into the ABRS. The GIS held the plates within the ABRS, facilitated access by the astronaut on orbit, and provided regular imaging (NASA,2011b; Paulet al.,2012a). After growth, all plates were photographed by the crew (Fig. 1B), along with the comparable GIS/ABRS-grown ground control (Fig. 1C). The plates were then harvested on orbit to RNAlater-filled Kennedy Space Center Fixation Tubes (KFTs) (Fig. 1D and 1E) and then stowed below −80°C in the MELFI freezer on the ISS (Ferlet al.,2011) before return. The ground control plates were similarly housed in the GIS of an ABRS in the Orbital Environmental Simulator chamber in the Spaceflight Life Sciences Laboratory at Kennedy Space Center following a similar, but delayed, timeline as the plates on the ISS, with the use of environmental data such as temperature, relative humidity, light levels, and CO2concentrations as was experienced by the plants on orbit. Further details on the operational outlines can be found in Paulet al. (2012a,2013). The ground control samples received the same physical processing steps of harvest, freezing, thawing, and distribution in the laboratory as did the spaceflight samples. Plant growth, hardware, harvesting, and preservation in RNAlater on the ISS. The Petri plates within which the plants were grown were housed in the GIS unit of the ABRS (A). A representative flight (B) and ground control (C) plate are shown, along with astronaut Jeff Williams harvesting plates on the ISS (D) for preservation in RNAlater in a KFT (E) before freezing on orbit. (Color images available online atwww.liebertonline.com/ast) 2.2. Isolation of proteins from RNAlater-preserved Arabidopsis The 12-day-old plants recovered from the frozen KFTs of both flight and ground control plants were thawed then dissected into roots, hypocotyls, and leaves, similar to the dissections performed by Paulet al.(2013). Approximately half the root material from 6–7 seedlings within a single Petri plate constituted each of three biological replicates for analysis of root proteins. For each replicate, 80 mg of RNAlater-fixed Arabidopsis root material was blotted with tissue to remove excess RNAlater and then ground in a liquid nitrogen–chilled pestle and mortar with 400 μL protein extraction buffer per sample [100 mMsodium phosphate (pH 7), 2 mMEDTA, 25 mMNaF, 5 mMMgCl2, 150 mMNaCl, 0.1% triton-X100, 10% glycerol, 1 mMdithiothreitol], commercial cocktails of protease (Set VI, Calbiochem) and phosphatase (Set I, Calbiochem) inhibitors. Samples were ground until completely homogeneous and then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant containing buffer-soluble proteins was collected, and proteins were purified as described by Kohet al.(2012). The leaf sample from flight and ground control plants was similarly prepared from half the material of a single Petri plate, constituting the leaves from seven plants. Protein assays were performed to quantify purified proteins by using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA) with the SoftMax Pro Software v5.3 (Molecular Devices, Downingtown, PA, USA) under the SpectraMax M5 (Molecular Devices). 2.3. Protein digestion, iTRAQ labeling, and MS A quadrupole-time-of-flight LTQ Orbitrap XL MS/MS system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) was used for data acquisition as described previously (Makarovet al.,2006). It was interfaced with an Eksigent nano-LC AS2 system (Eksigent Technologies, Dublin, CA, USA) using high-energy collision dissociation. Each fraction was loaded onto an Agilent Zorbax 300SB-C18 trap column (0.3 mm i.d.×5 mm length, 5 μm particle size) with a flow rate of 5 μL/min for 10 min. Reversed-phase C18chromatographic separation of peptides was carried out on a pre-packed BetaBasic C18PicoFrit column (75 μm i.d.×10 cm length, New Objective, Woburn, MA, USA) at 300 nL/min with the following gradient: 5% B for 1 min as an equilibration status; 60% B for 99 min as a gradient; 90% B for 5 min as a washing status; 5% B for 10 min as an equilibration status (solvent A: 0.1% formic acid in 97% water, 3% acetonitrile; solvent B: 0.1% formic acid in 97% acetonitrile, 3% water). The proteomics data are available for public access at the PRIDE Archive–proteomics data repository (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive). The MS proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium (http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org) via the PRIDE partner repository (Vizcainoet al.,2014) with the data-set identifier PXD001179 and DOI 10.6019/PXD001179. 2.5. Comparison of proteomic data with microarray data The proteomics data were compared with a previous gene expression study (Paulet al.,2013), which involved plants from the same experiment series on the ISS. In this comparison, we included 480 genes determined to be differentially expressed at the transcript level from that study and 546 differentially expressed proteins from this study. Among them, 34 genes exhibited differential expression at both transcript and protein levels. To examine the degree of concordance between transcript and protein expression levels for those commonly differentially expressed genes, correlation tests for which Pearson'srand Spearman'srho(rs) were used were conducted for a direct comparison of proteins and their corresponding transcript expression levels of those 34 genes using log2-fold change between ground and flight tissues. Those genes or proteins not differentially expressed at both the protein and transcript levels were not included in the correlation analysis. The differentially abundant proteins were examined for cell wall associations by using SUBA3 searches (Tanzet al.,2013). The proteins returned with cell wall associations from SUBA3 were analyzed for interaction networking with GeneMANIA (Warde-Farleyet al.,2010) with the Co-localization, Physical interactions, and Shared protein domains options, and Gene Ontology–based weighting. 3.1. Protein recovery and identification in spaceflight material Of the 1570 proteins identified in the samples at 5% FDR, 1167 leaf proteins and 1150 root proteins were identified with three or more protein-unique peptides, thus allowing them to be accurately quantified across the various flight and ground control samples (Fig. 2).

(Color graphics available online atwww.liebertonline.com/ast) Summary of the differential protein accumulation in spaceflight samples compared to ground control. Overall, 358 root and 256 shoot proteins were differentially represented in the spaceflight sample. When parsed by whether the protein was increased or decreased in spaceflight, 237 root proteins and 200 shoot proteins were up-regulated and accumulated to more abundance in spaceflight, while 121 root proteins and 56 shoot proteins were down-regulated in spaceflight. (Color graphics available online atwww.liebertonline.com/ast) In roots, 237 proteins were up-regulated in spaceflight, with an increase in abundance in the spaceflight samples meeting the significance criteria. In those same root samples, 121 proteins were found to be down-regulated and less abundant in spaceflight. For leaves, 200 proteins were more abundant in spaceflight, while 56 were less abundant. Again, few of these differentially regulated proteins were shared between the root and leaf samples. Only 47 proteins were similarly differentially abundant in both roots and leaves in spaceflight, being similarly increased or decreased in both tissues (Fig. 5). There were 21 proteins that were shared between roots and leaves but increased in one tissue and decreased in the other. A summary Venn diagram and table is presented at the bottom ofFig. 4.

Comparison of proteomic and gene expression data The proteomics data presented here were derived from Arabidopsis grown in Run 1B of the TAGES series of plant growth experiments. Gene expression from microarray data are available from Run 3A of the TAGES experiments (Paulet al.,2013), which involved similar-aged plants grown under very similar conditions on the ISS. The 546 differentially expressed proteins of the present study were compared to the 480 genes exhibiting differential transcript levels in the previous study. The genes encoding most of the proteins quantified in this study did not show a differential mRNA expression, and many of the proteins for genes differentially regulated at the mRNA level were not identified in this proteomics survey. A total of 34 genes exhibited differential expression at both transcript and protein levels. Their transcript and protein fold-change values are compared inFig. 5. Among the genes and proteins that do show differential expression, there is a positive correlation between direction and degree of differential expression (r=0.4901177,pvalue=0.0003028;rs=0.5087163,pvalue=0.0001618). To examine the degree of concordance between transcript and protein expression levels, correlation tests for which Pearson'srand Spearman'srho(rs) were used were conducted for a direct comparison of proteins and their corresponding transcript expression levels of 34 genes by using log2-fold change between ground and flight tissues. As shown inFig. 5, there is a positive correlation in direction and degree of differential expression between transcript and protein expression (r=0.4901177,pvalue=0.0003028;rs=0.5087163,pvalue=0.0001618). 3.5. Cell wall metabolism interaction network The technical goal of this study was to test the feasibility of using RNAlater-preserved plant tissue, harvested and frozen on orbit, for broad-scale proteomics analysis of Arabidopsis spaceflight responses. RNAlater preservation of Arabidopsis within KFTs on orbit is commonly practiced, and a facile process pathway exists for harvesting to RNAlater and frozen sample return from the ISS. RNAlater-preserved plant materials from the ISS have been extensively used for gene expression analyses; however, to date, the use of RNAlater-preserved ISS material for proteomics has been limited to yeast (van Eijsdenet al.,2013). The ability to conduct proteomics analyses on the same samples or on parallel samples returning from this established process pathway would advance the analysis potential for understanding Arabidopsis responses to spaceflight. The proteomic data from this study of three combined Arabidopsis lines support the general notion that plants engage specific metabolic responses to accomplish physiological adaptation to spaceflight, but that response is different among organs (Paulet al.,2013). The primary data supporting this conclusion are shown inFigs. 2and4. Of 885 proteins commonly quantified in roots and leaves, only 47 were similarly regulated in the spaceflight leaf and root samples. In contrast, 290 and 288 proteins in roots and leaves were uniquely differentially regulated by spaceflight in either one organ or the other. Moreover, pathway and process analysis of these differentially accumulated proteins indicates that roots and leaves are altering different pathways in response to spaceflight. There appears, broadly speaking, to be no single response at the proteomic level that is employed by all tissues of the plant in order to adapt to spaceflight. There are, however, a few common threads among the data sets. Roots and leaves adapt differently to spaceflight at the level of proteomics. While there are some commonalities among the spaceflight proteome changes in roots and leaves, such as cell wall metabolism, the present data indicate that roots and leaves invoke differential proteome responses to spaceflight. This is consistent with transcriptome data that also indicate differential spaceflight responses in leaves and roots (Paulet al.,2013). It is likely that, as proteomics technologies as well as gene expression and other omics technologies achieve increased density of coverage and finer spatial resolution, it will be revealed that different cell types within organs respond differently to spaceflight. And as increased numbers of biological experiments are enabled on the ISS, it is likely that multiple approaches will combine to yield both cell-specific response pathways as well as more general principles involved in plant spaceflight adaptation. Cell wall modifications in spaceflight, in addition to or governed by auxin signaling, may be one of those general and recurring metabolic adaptations that may be in common among plants and plant tissues, even if enacted by various proteins and genes that differ among cell types or genotypes.
