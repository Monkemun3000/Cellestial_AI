The RWV culture apparatus (Fig.1) allows a physiolo-gically-relevant low fluid shear force growth environment that induces a number of phenotypic responses in bacteria including altered stress resistance [1-5,7,12,16,21], increased survival in cellular and animal hosts [1,3,4,7], and altered gene expression [1,3,5,7,13,14,17,18]. The RWV is used to induce prokaryotic and eukaryotic cellular phenotypes that are difficult or not possible to obtain using conventional culture conditions [1,18,21,24]. This includes use as a ground-based modeled microgravity environment to study effects/phenotypes that correlate to those observed in spaceflight experiments [3,7,17,24]. The alteration of bacterial virulence observed during growth in spaceflight and in the RWV is currently being used for applications related to bacterial engineering and modificationviagrowth conditions [1,3,7,18,25-27]. Given these commonalities and based upon previous modeling, the environmental growth condition obtained in the RWV apparatus has been termed low shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) [2,4,5]. The rotating wall vessel (RWV).PanelA: The rotating wall vessel serves as a low fluid shear cell culture apparatus. The vessel is completely filled with media containing cells (no air bubbles) and rotated at 25 rpm. In the pictured orientation of the vessel (LSMMG condition), this creates a low shear, low turbulence suspension culture environment for cell growth. Aeration is providedviaan air-permeable membrane located in the back of the vessel (not visible).PanelB: The two orientations of the RWV for experimental set up. For RWV experiments, two separate apparatuses are used that are set up in two different orientations using the same culture inoculation. In the control orientation, the low fluid shear environment is abolished and increased fluid shear levels are present. The only difference in the two cultures is the orientation of each vessel.PanelC: A diagram of the orbital path of a representative cell in the LSMMG orientation of the RWV to demonstrate the nature of the low fluid shear cell suspension. This is achieved in large part by the solid body rotation of the media in the apparatus in such a way that sedimentation is offset to allow suspension with a minimum of fluid shear forces. Rotating Wall Vessel (RWV) Cultures Cultures were grown in the RWV in LB (Lennox) broth as previously described [3,4,7]. Experimental set-up with RWV cultures is depicted in Fig. (1). The RWV apparatus used was model RCCS-1 from Synthecon, Inc., Houston, TX as used in previous studies [3,4,7]. Strains used in this study were as follows:S.Typhimurium Ï‡3339 [29],E. coliTOP10 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA),E. coliMG1655 [30],E. coliDH5a (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA),E. coliAS11 [31],E. cloacaeATCC23355 [32],C. freundiiATCC8090 [32], andS. marcescensATCC14041 [33]. Acid and oxidative stress assays were performed as previously described [3,4,7]. The qPCR reactions were performed as previously described using 16S rRNA andlpxCgenes for normalization [3,34]. DNA oligonucleotides used as primers in qPCR are provided in Table1. DNA oligonucleotides used in this study. Deletion mutations in thetrpRandtrpDEgenes were constructed using standard recombineering techniques inS.Typhimurium andE. coliand confirmed using both PCR and phenotypic indications [35]. DNA oligonucleotides used in the recombineering are provided in Table1. Briefly, PCR products were amplified from the template plasmid pKD3 using primers containing 40-bp regions of homology to the ends of thetrpRandtrpDEgenes such that deletion of the genes would be obtained. Strains containing plasmid pKD46 were electroporated with the PCR products, and colonies were selected on LB-Cm medium. Acid and Oxidative Stress Phenotypes LSMMG-mediated alteration of acid stress resistance in Enterobacteriaceae.The indicated strains were grown in the RWV in the LSMMG and control conditions for testing of acid stress resistance (pH=3.5, citric acid, 2 hours stress exposure) as previously described [3, 7]. To test survival of the stress in the LSMMG and control samples, aliquots from each sample were removed from the stress, serially-diluted in PBS, and plated for CFU counts on LB media. The percent survival of the bacteria compared to the number present at t=0 before addition of the stress was determined for each sample, and then a ratio of percent survival values was calculated and plotted as indicated in the graph (either control/control or LSMMG/control). The data was obtained from at least three independent experiments each plated in triplicate, and the average and standard deviation are plotted. The differences between LSMMG and control were significant at p-value < 0.05. Oxidative stress resistance altered by LSMMG in Enterobacteriaceae.RWV cultures of the indicated strains were tested for oxidative stress resistance (hydrogen peroxide, 35 - 70 mM, 2 hours stress exposure) as described in Fig. (3) and as previously described [4, 33] The data was obtained from at least three independent experiments each plated in triplicate, and the average and standard deviation are plotted. The differences between LSMMG and control were significant at p-value < 0.05. To test for changes in gene expression induced by LSMMG in different genera, we isolated total RNA fromS.Typhimurium ,E. coli,E. cloacae, andC. freundiicultures grown at LSMMG and control conditions and analyzed gene expression using qRT-PCR [3,18]. InS.Typhimurium , the expression of thehfqandtrpDgenes was decreased and increased, respectively, by LSMMG (Fig.5). This result is consistent with previously published data which identified altered expression of these genes by LSMMG using microarray analysis and qPCR [3,5,7]. InE. coli, LSMMG decreased the expression of both genes indicating that LSMMG altered gene expression in this genus, but that the direction oftrpDregulation was reversed compared toS.Typhimurium (Fig.5). This is interesting given the fact that the direction of LSMMG-induced acid resistance alteration was also reversed accordingly in these two genera (Fig.3). InC. freundii,hfqexpression was also decreased by LSMMG, buttrpDexpression was not significantly altered (Fig.5). As inE. coli, thetrpDresult also correlates to the acid resistance phenotype inC. freundiiwhere LSMMG did not cause altered resistance to this stress. InE. cloacae, we did not observe alteration ofhfqexpression by LSMMG but did observe an increase in expression of theydcIgene by LSMMG (Fig.5). TheydcIresult is consistent with previously reported data which identified this gene as LSMMG-regulated inS.Typhimurium [4,5]. Overall, qRT-PCR analysis demonstrated that a molecular response to LSMMG resulting in gene expression changes is conserved across Enterobactericeae, but the direction of gene expression change (i.e. up or down) can potentially vary depending on genus. qRT-PCR analysis to determine LSMMG-induced alterations of gene expression in Enterobacteriaceae. Total RNA harvested from LSMMG and control cultures was converted to single-stranded cDNA and used as template in qPCR analysis with primers hybridizing to the indicated genes as described previously [3, 18]. PCR product levels were normalized to both the 16S rRNA andlpxCgenes [3, 34], and a ratio of each gene level for LSMMG to control was calculated to give a fold-difference in expression between the two samples as previously described [3]. Differences in expression between LSMMG and control samples were significant at p-value < 0.05. The data was obtained from at least four qPCR reactions using RNA from at least two independent cultures for each condition, and the data is plotted as the average and standard deviation. In the experiments above, we observed an inverse correlation between the direction of change in acid resistance by LSMMG and the direction of regulation oftrpDexpression by LSMMG inS.Typhimurium andE. coli(Figs.3,5). In addition,we observed that inC. freundii, these phenotypes correlated to eachother in that LSMMG did not induce alteration of acid stress ortrpDexpression in this species (Figs.3,5). This observation is curious since thetrpgenes are not involved in acid resistance, and the activity of the anthrylate synthase enzyme encoded by thetrpoperon is not involved in environmental stress resistance. However,inS.Typhimurium , thetrpDgene was one of the few genes in a group found to be up-regulated by all low-shear/micro-gravity conditions tested including LSMMG in LB media [5] and by spaceflight in both LB and M9 media [3,7], and this result was observed using both microarray and qPCR analysis [3,5,7]. In addition, a study with adherent-invasiveE. colishowed that a mutation in a tryptophan permease gene altered an LSMMG-induced phenotype related to cell adherence, and this alteration was complemented by restoring the WT gene or by exogenous indole supplementation [28]. Taken together, the above observations provided justification to analyze the role oftrpgenes in the LSMMG response.We reasoned that the changes intrpDexpression under LSMMG could be related to a regulatory mechanism acting up-stream of thetrpoperon that is responsive to and/or involved in the LSMMG response pathway. The TrpR protein is a transcriptional regulator that controls expression of thetrpoperon as well as several other genes distributed across theS.Typhimurium andE. coligenomes [36]. Since this protein regulates a global gene regulon, we viewed TrpR as a possible candidate regulatory mechanism through which the LSMMG response acts in bacteria. We therefore constructed Î”trpRmutations inS.Typhimurium andE. coli, and we tested these mutants for display of LSMMG phenotypes (Fig.6). We found that the deletion of TrpR had no effect on the acid and oxidative stress LSMMG responses in these genera indicating that TrpR is likely not involved in the LSMMG response under the conditions tested here (Fig.6). In addition, we also considered the possibility that the anthrylate synthase enzyme encoded by thetrpoperon could be having a role in the LSMMG response. Therefore, we constructed a Î”trpDEmutation inS.Typhimurium andE. colithat knocked out expression of this enzyme, and we tested these mutants for LSMMG phenotypes compared to WT (Fig.6). As with the Î”trpRstrains, we observed no effect of Î”trpDEon LSMMG responses in these genera indicating that thetrpoperon genes are not involved the LSMMG response as tested here. Analysis of role oftrpgenes in LSMMG phenotypes.S.Typhimurium andE.coliÎ”trpRand Î”trpDEstrains were compared to respective WT strains for LSMMG-mediated alteration of acid and oxidative stress as described in Figs. (3,4). The data was obtained from at least three independent experiments each plated in triplicate, and the average and standard deviation are plotted. The differences between LSMMG and control were significant at p-value < 0.05.
