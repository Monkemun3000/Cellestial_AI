While fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) and humans exhibit immune system dysfunction in space, studies examining their immune systems’ interactions with natural parasites in space are lacking.Drosophilaparasitoid wasps modify blood cell function to suppress host immunity. In this study, naive and parasitized ground and space flies from a tumor-free control and a blood tumor-bearing mutant strain were examined. Inflammation-related genes were activated in space in both fly strains. Whereas control flies did not develop tumors, tumor burden increased in the space-returned tumor-bearing mutants. Surprisingly, control flies were more sensitive to spaceflight than mutant flies; many of their essential genes were downregulated. Parasitoids appeared more resilient than fly hosts, and spaceflight did not significantly impact wasp survival or the expression of their virulence genes. Previously undocumented mutant wasps with novel wing color and wing shape were isolated post-flight and will be invaluable for host-parasite studies on Earth. Subject areas:Parasitology, Biological sciences, Entomology Spaceflight enhances immune gene expression and tumor development in fruit flies Drosophilaparasitoid wasps can develop in space without losing virulence Parasitoid mutants with visible alterations were obtained Parasitology; Biological sciences; Entomology As humans become a space-faring species, they must confront the dual and long-term challenges of microgravity and radiation. Robust immune physiology and intact genomes are vital to the success of manned space exploration efforts. Animals and plants harbor a diverse array of microbial and metazoan pathogens and parasites. While the effects of the space environment in low Earth orbit are documented on many host species, with a focus on humans,1the effects of space on the accompanying pathogens and parasites are not known. This question is especially important as immune-compromised humans (and other animal hosts), or those with dysfunctional immunity, venture into space. Experiments with theDrosophilamodel organism and studies on astronauts over the last decade have revealed how highly conserved innate immune functions and mechanisms are altered in space.2,3These and earlier studies (reviewed by Iyer et al.4) also demonstrated that fruit flies can successfully develop in space, opening the system to further inquiry. In this study, we examined the effects of spaceflight onD. melanogasterinfested with their natural parasitoid wasps that journeyed to and back from the International Space Station (ISS), aboard SpaceX-14, on a 34-day mission. Parasitoid wasps represent a large class of obligate parasitic insects, and many are used in the biocontrol of agricultural pests. The term endoparasitoid refers to the wasp whose preimaginal stages develop within the host larva and pupa. The developing parasitoid (or parasite) eats the host as both continue to develop; the host builds a puparium that a parasite ultimately occupies and emerges from.Drosophilalarvae and pupae serve as hosts to more than 60 species of such parasitic wasps.5The female wasp’s sharp ovipositor pierces the first line of host defense—the larval exoskeleton, made of cuticle—to introduce an egg and venom. This step triggers an encapsulation response in which larval blood cells (hemocytes) of the hosts’ innate immune system (macrophage-like plasmatocytes—called macrophages here—and their derivatives, lamellocytes) cooperate to recognize, surround, melanize, and destroy the wasp egg.6This melanotic capsule itself, composed of dozens of macrophages and lamellocytes, shields the host from the dead parasite as it continues to become an adult fly. Encapsulation, an innate immune response, is conserved across many multicellular animals.6,7 Encapsulation of the parasite egg byDrosophilalarvae is not always fatal to the parasite, as active and passive means to avoid encapsulation have evolved to assure that at least some percentage of parasitic wasp infections are successful.Leptopilina heterotoma(Lh) is highly successful on manyDrosophilaspecies and is considered to be a generalist parasite.8Its venom contains spiked extracellular vesicle (EV)-like structures with immune-suppressive activities.9,10LhEVs are surrounded by a phospholipid bilayer, and their protein composition is similar to that of mammalian EVs.11,12L. boulardi(Lb) is a specialist parasite and is successful on a narrower host range thanLh.8,13LbEVs also bear spikes, are immune-suppressive, and have a protein profile similar toLhEVs.13,14,15,16There is no evidence that eitherLborLhEV-like structures possess a genome or that they replicate in either the wasp or the host. The protein-coding genes ofLhEVs are present in the wasp genome.12 While the venom EVs from bothLbandLhare immune suppressive, their effects on hemocytes differ greatly.LbEVs enter lamellocytes and alter lamellocyte shape to suppress encapsulation without killing them.17LhEVs, on the other hand, lyse lamellocytes within a few hours after infection.18,19LhEVs also kill circulating macrophages as well as hemocyte progenitors housed within a small hematopoietic organ called the lymph gland.18,20Thus, despite differing in the ways they attack host hemocytes, both wasps effectively create immune-deficient hosts, making it conducive for wasp development. In 20–25 days, one adult wasp emerges per fly pupa; male and female wasps mate as free-living adults, and females then deposit eggs into fly larvae to initiate another generation.8,13,21 The aims of this study were to (a) compare how conditions in the ISS affect healthy control and CI fly hosts; (b) examine if the development of endoparasites occurs normally in the ISS; and (c) study if parasite virulence is affected in space. We report that fewer than expected tumor-free control fruit fly strain returned to Earth, but, unexpectedly, the tumor-bearing CI strain succeeded in space just as well as ground controls. In both strains, genes encoding extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins or ECM-associated proteins (together, matrisome proteins) that contribute to cuticle and chorion structure and function were strongly affected in space, but genes essential for life were downregulated only in the control fruit fly strain. Orthologs of many of these genes have disease relevance in humans. However, inflammation-related genes were activated in both strains, and, while the control flies remained free of tumors, the tumor burden in the space-returned CI strain increased. The effects of spaceflight on parasite emergence were minimal, if any, and changes in the expression of virulence genes were modest, at best. The venom activity ofLhfrom space wasps was comparable to that of ground wasps, and their virulence EV particles were normally distributed within the hosts. Visible mutations affecting wing shape, color, and ovipositor integrity were identified in the progeny of spaceL. heterotoma. Pathogens and parasites pose a threat to astronaut’s health during spaceflight. Bacteria reared under microgravity conditions exhibit an increase in virulence.31,32Thus, in addition to assessing changes in host immune mechanisms, it is important to evaluate changes in pathogen or parasite virulence in space in the context of their natural hosts. Our studies show that metazoan parasites can develop normally in space, retaining their infection strategies. Continued analysis of such systems will be important to help establish multigenerational studies and to obtain a fine-grained understanding of the long-term effects of space on diverse organisms.

See alsoFigure S9. Effects of spaceflight on gene expression in adult flies Volcano plots of the four comparisons revealed distinct gene identity profiles in each comparison (Figures S1B–S1E). This distinction between the strains is also clearly evident from Gene Ontology-based Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis showing active Toll/Imd (immune deficiency) signaling not only in naive G0hopTum-lcompared toy wflies but, surprisingly, also in S0y wandhopTum-lflies, relative to their G0 counterparts (Figure S2A). Furthermore, for these same three comparisons, the top 20 significantly enriched (adjusted p value < 0.05) Gene Ontology terms in Biological Process enrichment analyses included host defense terms such as response to bacterium, response to other organism, and response to biotic stimulus (Figure S2B). These four comparisons allowed us to decouple the effects of genetic strain differences in the S0/G0 culture conditions. We next examined changes in expression patterns of the most significantly DEGs (Top DEGs), genes essential to fly viability (Essential DEGs), and immune genes in the JAK/STAT and Toll/Imd pathways (Pathway DEGs), as summarized inFigure S1F. Top DEGs in space include members of protease, endopeptidase, and matrisome gene families Differential expression of Top DEGs in S0/G0 adult flies (A and B) Top DEGs upregulated (A) or downregulated (B) in G0hopTum-lvs. G0y w.

Essential genes are downregulated iny wflies exposed to spaceflight Differential expression of essential genes in S0/G0 adult flies (A) The expression of 137 genes essential to fly viability that were differentially expressed (adjusted p < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1) in one or more comparisons is shown. (B) Expression of 34 genes pertinent to human health. The DIOPT category and score-relevant human disease or trait linked to the human ortholog were determined using theDrosophilaRNAi Screening Center Integrative Ortholog Prediction Tool.41The disease/trait category for the fly gene refers to at least one human disease or trait linked to one or more human ortholog. MS, musculoskeletal; DN, development/neurological; MO, metabolic-/obesity-related; S, skin-related; P, pulmonary; IA, infection and/or autoimmune; C, coronary-/cardiac-related. (C) The differential expression of essential genes with no human ortholog or none-to-low disease relevance. See alsoFigure S1. Differentially expressed essential genes reveal association with human disease conditions To assess why S0y wflies were sensitive to spaceflight and if they have relevance to human conditions, we filtered the 137 essential DEGs for a DIOPT (Drosophila RNAi Screening Center Integrative Ortholog Prediction Tool) score of at least 12 and identified 34 high-scoring DEGs that we grouped into broad categories. Strikingly, we observed 22 DEGs that were significantly downregulated in S0y wversus G0y wflies.Oseg5andBiotinidaseexpression was downregulated in G0hopTum-lversus G0y wflies; for both genes, this downregulation was maintained in space. Only two genes,veilandmelt, showed significant upregulation (Figure 4B). This analysis revealed that human orthologs of these 34 fly genes affect many aspects of human physiology (seeFigure 4B for details). The remaining 17 essential DEGs, with a low DIOPT value (i.e., < 12), were annotated with enzymatic, developmental, or unknown functions. The most significantly upregulated genes inhopTum-lversusy wflies werel(2)03659(enables organic anion transporter activity) andIr40a(involved in response to humidity changes),42both maintaining differential expression in space. In addition, six DEGs, each in S0y wflies and S0hopTum-lflies, were either upregulated or downregulated, relative to their corresponding ground controls (Figure 4C). Spaceflight activates the expression of immune genes in S0 adults and increases inflammatory tumor burden in S0hopTum-l A comparison of the Gene Ontology-based pathway and Biological Process enrichment terms associated with they wversushopTum-ltranscriptional profiles provided a “big picture” view of the differential effects of space on the two strains. Both plots show that, while most GO terms and almost all biological processes are affected iny wflies, only a few parameters change in both strains. Most notable of these are the Toll/Imd pathway and lysosomal pathway terms that are significantly enriched in the space samples for both genotypes, suggesting the activation of inflammation-related genes in space (Figures S2A and S2B). Since thehopTum-lmutant fly strain carries a constitutively active JAK enzyme,43the transcriptional activation of known JAK-STAT target genes is expected inhopTum-lflies relative toy wflies without this mutation. Consistent with this expectation we found many target genes (Idgf1, SOCS36E,TotA,CG3829, CG4793,CG13559, andCG10764) to be differentially upregulated in G0hopTum-lversus G0y wflies. High levels of JAK-STAT pathway genesTotA,diedel,et, andCG4793inhopTum-lversusy wwere maintained in space (Figure 5A). Similarly, several Toll pathway components (PGRPs SA, SB1, and SD, grass, SPE) and target genes were significantly upregulated in G0hopTum-lversus G0y wflies (Figures 5B–5E). Differentially expressed immune signaling genes in S0/G0 adult flies (A) JAK-STAT pathway components and target genes are shown based on fold induction. Genes were grouped based on their annotation in FlyBase37as follows:upd2andupd3are ligands;CycD,CycE, andCdk2are positive regulators;diedel,Socs36E, andetare negative regulators. The target genes areTotA,Idgf1,pirk,mfas,CG3829,CG4793,CG13559,CG10764,CG15211, andGf. (B–E) Differentially expressed Toll pathway components: core components (B), pathogen recognition receptors (C), antimicrobial peptides (D), and other targets (E). Only significantly affected DEGs (adjusted p < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1, in one or more comparisons) are shown. See alsoFigures S1andS2. Whereas many immune genes are constitutively active inhopTum-lflies, remarkably, spaceflight activated the expression of a majority of these immune genes iny wflies (Figures 5B–5E). The JAK-STAT pathway ligands (upd2andupd3), several core components (SOCS36E), and target genes (TotA,Gf,mfas, andCG15211) were activated in S0y wversus G0y wflies (Figure 5A). A clear signature for Toll/Imd pathway activation was also observed in S0y wadults. Elevated expression of pathway components (CG8046,Toll-9,Figure 5B), pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs,PGRPs SA,SB1,SD,Figure 5C), several antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes (Figure 5D), and other Toll/Imd pathway target genes (Figure 5E) was observed in S0y wversus G0y wflies. Notably, some Toll/Imd pathway target genes (e.g.,Drsl2,3,5) were also activated in S0hopTum-lversus G0hopTum-lflies (Figure 5D).

(D and E) Weighted average number of tumors per animal (tumor burden) in adult fly samples retrieved from ground (G0) and space (S0) (D) and values from their ground (G1) and space (S1) adult progeny (E). The weighted tumor numbers per animal in G0 and S0 adults were 1.07 ± 0.22 and 2.94 ± 0.40, respectively (mean ± standard error; p = 0.015, Student’sttest; ∗ indicates p < 0.05). The weighted average tumor numbers per animal in G1 and S1hopTum-ladult males were 5.09 ± 0.08 and 5.07 ± 0.33, respectively (mean ± standard error; p = 0.95, Student’sttest). See alsoFigures S1andS2. High immune gene expression persists in naive S1 larvae Cellular immunity in G1 and S1hopTum-llarvae, post parasitization (A) Tumor (T) scores of uninfected (UI) and tumor and encapsulation (T + E) scores of G0/S0Lb- or G0/S0Lh-infected G1/S1hopTum-llarvae. Value above each bar indicates the mean ± standard error. Tumor-encapsulation scores are higher in S1 than in G1hopTum-lhosts Previous studies withhopTum-llarvae have shown thatLb17attack provokes stronger cellular immune reactions thanLh14does. WhileLb17attack elicits encapsulation of the wasp egg due to an overabundance of circulating hemocytes (not recruited into the melanized tumors),Lh14-infectedhopTum-llarvae instead develop small melanized specks8(seeFigure S4for examples of immune reactions). To assess if naive S1 versus G1hopTum-llarval hosts differ in their ability to mount an encapsulation response, we exposed them to G0/S0Lb17orLh14wasps and computed a composite tumor-encapsulation (T + E) score for these animals, which measures their self- and wasp egg-induced encapsulation response. The experimental design consisted of scoring T + E scores from all G/S and host/parasite combinations. The following findings emerged from our comparisons of naive versusLb17- orLh14-infectedhopTum-lhosts. First, naive versus G0 or S0Lb-infected G1 or S1hopTum-lhosts showed a ∼17- to 52-fold increase in T + E scores, and scores from three of the four combinations differed significantly (Figures 7A and 7B). The T + E score in naive versus G0/S0Lh-infected G1 or S1hopTum-lhosts in all four combinations similarly increased from 1.4- to 14-fold, and the increases were significantly different across all four comparisons (Figures 7A and 7B). It is noteworthy that the canonical Toll pathway targetDrsis strongly upregulated in S1hopTum-lhosts afterLb17infection, but its expression remains unchanged afterLh14infection (Drs,Figures S3F and S3G). This trend is characteristic of these wasps’ effects on wild-type hosts8and suggests that the overall differences in wasp virulence were maintained in spaceflight. Second, S1 compared to G1 hosts, infected by S0 (but not G0) wasps of both species (S0 Lb/Lh_S1hosts versus S0 Lb/Lh_G1hosts), were more competent at mounting an immune response (3.64 ± 0.46 versus 2.11 ± 0.72 [p = 0.0199] forLb17and 0.76 ± 0.03 versus 0.11 ± 0.04 [p = 5.55 e−10] forLh14;Figures 7A and 7B). Thus, not only is the tumor score higher in naive S1 compared to G1hopTum-llarvae but S1 hosts are also more immune reactive than G1 hosts. Lymph gland morphologies of naive and infected G0 and S0 hosts UponLb17attack, hemocytes in wild-type lymph gland lobes divide and differentiate into lamellocytes and disperse into the hemocoel to surround the wasp egg.44,45,46Hemocytes in thehopTum-llymph gland actively divide and differentiate in the absence of infection.43Because of the high inflammation state of space animals, we examined differences in lymph gland lobes from third-instar G0 and S0 animals. A normal lymph gland has multiple, paired lobes, consisting of hemocytes, positioned along the tubular dorsal vessel that continues into a pulsating heart, which directs the flow of the hemolymph and circulating hemocytes into the body cavity (Figures S5A–S5D). The anterior-most lobes are the largest, with hemocytes at varying differentiation stages. The posterior lobes are smaller in size and harbor fewer differentiated cells than the anterior lobes. The margins of all lobes from naivey wground and space hosts were continuous with none-to-little dispersal. Like lobes from G0 naivey wanimals, lobes from S0 naivey wanimals did not exhibit any hemocyte loss or any other obvious morphological change (Figures S5A–S5H). G1 and S1y whost lymph glands were unresponsive afterLbparasitization (Figures S6A–S6F). In naive G1hopTum-llymph glands, GFP-expressing cells were absent (Figures S6G and S6H), whereas in S1 hosts lamellocytes were clearly observed regardless of infection status (Figures S6I–S6P). In some samples, lamellocyte-rich tumors were associated with the anterior and posterior lobes (e.g., S1 sample,Figures S6K and S5L). In only one S1 host, the anterior lobes exhibited a strong anti-wasp response (Figure S6O). Thus, even though the T + E scores rise in response toLbinfection, this difference was not reflected in the lymph gland morphologies of the animals we examined. Perturbation ofLbandLhEV gene expression The venom fluid containing the EVs is injected into the host during oviposition. Due to their close association with and direct effects on target hemocytes,17,20our definition of virulence proteins in this study is restricted to those that make up the EVs. Since standard annotations of wasp transcripts are not available, a custom pipeline was developed to analyze gene expression changes against corresponding transcriptomes (Figure S8A). Overall, in adult male and female wasps, the effects of spaceflight were detected (Figures S8B and S8C), although they were modest, and less than 1.5% of all transcripts identified showed significant change when compared to respective ground controls (293 and 310 transcripts, forLb17andLh14, respectively). A majority of the transcripts were downregulated in both wasps (Figures 8A–8C;Tables S2andS3). Furthermore, the intensity of gene expression change was also mild. Of the downregulated DEGs (adjusted p < 0.05), more than 80% showed log (2)-FC between −1.00 and −2.00 (228/280 inLb17and 250/261 inLh14). The remaining downregulated DEGs showed log (2)-FC between −2.00 and −9.18. Only 6 of all DEGs showed a log (2)-FC > 2 forLb17; this number was 16 forLh14. These DEGs do not appear to belong to a specific functional class, and many lack clear annotations. Differential expression of EV genes (A and B) Enhanced volcano plots for DEGs inLb17(A) andLh14(B) S0 vs. G0 wasp samples. Numerical identifiers correspond to EV genes inTables 1and2, with their corresponding accession numbers. (D) Transcripts coding for EV proteins in the RNA-Seq samples show that 312Lb17EV and 398Lh14EV transcripts were identified for each wasp. Of these, only 29Lb17and 5Lh14transcripts were differentially expressed in S0 vs. G0 samples. Their identities, fold-change values, and conserved protein domains are shown inTables 1and2. See alsoFigures S8,S10, andS11. The identities of the proteins constitutingL. boulardiEVs were recently published.14Our comparative analysis indicated thatLbEV proteins show an overall profile similar to theLhEV profile; both are enriched in mammalian EV proteins.15A majority (> 98%) of the EV transcripts were identified in our RNA-Seq analysis (312/316 forLb17and 398/406 forLh14). InLb17, 29/312 (9.89%) EV genes were significantly differentially expressed (Figure 8D). Of these, 28 were downregulated (Table 1). Two mildly downregulated genes are predicted to encode RhoGAP superfamily proteins (GAJA01018902.1, log (2)-FC = −1.27, andGAJA01006288.1, log (2)-FC = −1.09). A RhoGAP superfamily protein called LbGAP inLbEVs is implicated in wasp virulence.48,49Of the two downregulated wasp RhoGAP superfamily proteins, only one (GAJA01018902.1) showed homology to LbGAP: 69.7% nucleotide sequence identity (68% query coverage; 8e-55). ForLh14, only 5/398 (1.61%) transcripts were significantly differentially expressed. Of these, only one gene, lacking annotation, was about 5-fold upregulated (Table 2). Of the downregulated genes, three lack annotations, and one is predicted to encode a protein with a chitin-binding domain. Lb17EV transcripts whose expression is significantly altered (adjusted p < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1) in S0 wasps compared to G0 wasps Conserved domains and motifs were detected via the Conserved Domain Database.50GenBank accession numbers and E-values of the domain or protein family are shown. Transcripts are organized by log (2)-FC in their expression. ID refers to the Lb identifier for each transcript labeled in the volcano plot inFigure 8A. The master record forLb17transcriptome in the Transcriptome Shotgun Assembly (TSA) sequence database is GenBank:GAJA00000000. Lh14EV transcripts whose expression is significantly altered in S0 wasps compared to G0 wasps (adjusted p < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1) Spaceflight does not significantly affect wasp emergence Spaceflight did not significantly affect the overall development of wasps. The yields per vial of each wasp species reared in space were comparable to those of ground control samples (Figure 2E). The relative success of parasite versus host in individual vials suggested that eachLeptopilinaspecies successfully disarmed bothy wandhopTum-lhosts in space and also on Earth (Figures 2D and 2E). However, while nohopTum-lhosts escaped parasitization byLborLhin either ground or space cultures, somey wflies emerged in the co-culture vials (Figure 2D), likely because these hosts overcame parasite infection or remained uninfected by the available parasites. When total wasps were scored relative to all insects (% wasps/total insects in each vial;Figure S9A), we found no significant difference in space- versus ground-reared wasp samples. Both wasp species raised on either fly host showed equal success in flight and ground conditions (Figure S9B), reinforcing this conclusion. EV morphology andLh14virulence We next investigated whether the morphology of EV particles produced by both wasp species is affected by spaceflight. In the scanning electron micrographs of gold-coated samples of G0 and S0Lb17wasp venom, we observed no gross morphological difference (Figures S10A–S10G). The overall shapes and morphologies reported previously9,16were maintained in both samples. In addition to the regularly shaped, spiked particles, there were many particles with heterogeneous shapes, although most had spike-like processes. We observed small membranous protrusions on the particles from both G0 and S0 EV samples that were previously not reported. The G0 and S0Lh14EV morphologies were also indistinguishable (and similar to previously reported structures9), in scanning electron micrographs of gold-coated samples (Figures S10H–S10S). Overall, theLh14particle morphologies were uniform, and the particles were spiked, with variable spike length. (A) Steps employed for the isolation of mutant wasps. (B–F) Phenotypes of mutant wasps (C–F), identified from space samples compared to wild-type (B)Lhwasps. Males of wild type,aurum1(pigmentation of the wing blade and of wing veins affected), andkona1(wing shape affected) wasps are shown. Horizontal arrows point to differences in melanization in wild-type versusaurum1mutants. The color difference is subtle but consistent. Vertical arrows point to the angular wing shape of thekona1mutant as compared to the rounded wild-type wing blade. Double mutants in panels (E) and (F) possess both mutant traits. The shape of the left wing in panel (F) is wild-type in appearance, while the right one (arrow) is angular. Samples in panels B–F were photographed at the same time. (G) A side-by-side comparison of wild type (left) andaurum1(right) wings shows a clear difference in the melanization of wing veins. (H) Theaurumandkonaloci appear to be unlinked, as F2 males from unmated heterozygous females were scored in roughly equal proportions.

(J) Representative ovipositors from wild-type and mutant wasps. Homozygouskona1females with defective ovipositors show areas of compromised integrity or have branched ends (arrows) compared to the continuous ovipositors with sharp ends from wild-type control wasps (+/+). Posterior is to the top. Scale bar = 300 μm. See alsoFigure S12. To assess ifaurumandkonagenes are unlinked, we scored over 1,000 sons of unmated double mutant heterozygous females. Roughly equal numbers of parental and recombinant classes were observed (chi-squared test, p = 0.63;Figure 9H). Even though thekona1strain was homozygous viable, we were unable to make a pure-breeding stock. Moreover, we did not find wasp eggs in dissected hosts, regardless of whether the infectingkona1/kona1females were unmated or mated. This result suggested that homozygouskona1females were unable to oviposit while their heterozygous counterparts were successful (Figure 9I). The ovipositors ofkona1homozygotes showed structural defects, including branched termini instead of the sharp, needle-like ends of the wild-typeLhovipositor (Figure 9J). Abdominal dissection ofkona1/kona1females revealed ovaries and eggs that are morphologically indistinguishable from wild-type or heterozygous females (Figure S12). Thus, it appears that oogenesis is likely unaffected inkona1mutants, and they are sterile due to their inability to oviposit. American scientists first launched fruit flies into space in 1947, and since then more than 20 spaceflight experiments with fruit flies have been conducted.4Even parasitic wasps have been to space: in 1967, Biosatellite II carriedHabrobracon juglandisinto space.53H. juglandisis a small ectoparasite that attacks moths. The Biosatellite II mission reported multiple effects of spaceflight alone, or that of radiation in conjunction with spaceflight, onD. melanogasterandH. juglandis.53,54D. melanogaster, however, continues to be an obvious choice for space travel studies for all the advantages the model organism offers researchers on Earth. Among the most cost-effective model systems, its high fecundity and small size facilitate the study of large numbers of individual flies, which is necessary for statistically relevant experimental protocols. These previous “fruit flies in space” studies have tackled a variety of questions, including development, aging, mating, cardiac, and neural functions, that have implications for astronaut health.4,55Despite suffering from cardiac and neurological deficits,33,56Drosophilaborn in space can largely survive the dual challenges of short-term exposure to microgravity and radiation. Strain-specific effects on survival and transcriptional readouts inDrosophilaare induced by spaceflight stressors Spaceflight conditions exerted unexpected and differential effects on our experimentalDrosophilastrains. While thehopTum-lflies with CI survived just as well in space as on the ground, they wstrain, free of tumors and CI, was surprisingly more vulnerable to the spaceflight stressors, and fewery wflies emerged from the flight compared to ground cultures. Molecular analysis revealed a complex interplay between genetic and environmental conditions. Three trend lines are noteworthy, which are discussed in the following. First, specific expression profiles of Top DEGs attributed to genetic differences were maintained in space, suggesting that the gene regulatory circuits underlying these differences may be sufficiently robust and may therefore remain refractory to spaceflight. Elevated immune signaling in space hosts Our previous molecular-genetic analysis ofhopTum-llarvae showed that hyperactive Toll signaling in larval lamellocytes contributes to CI phenotypes.24A plethora of target genes of both the JAK-STAT and Toll pathways is constitutively active inhopTum-lmutants. Strikingly, many of the same pathway components and target genes that are constitutively active inhopTum-lmutants are also upregulated in S0y wflies, even though the S0y wflies remained tumor free. A few AMP genes (e.g.,Drs,Drsl,CecA, etc.) are further upregulated in S0hopTum-lflies, suggesting that the increased tumor burden in S0hopTum-ladults is fueled by ectopic JAK-STAT and Toll signaling induced in space. Unlike their parents, however, naive S1y wlarvae did not exhibit a clear and strong inflammatory gene expression readout (see S0/G0y wcolumn inFigure 5D and S1/G1y wcolumn inFigure S3D, where constitutive immune signaling does not mask the effects of space). In contrast, like their parents, many immune genes in naive G1/S1 larvae were active inhopTum-llarvae. Even though changes in mitotic indices of host hemocytes or their lymph gland morphologies were not detected in these S1 versus G1hopTum-llarvae, a significantly enhanced T score was observed in naive S1 versus G1hopTum-llarvae. This increased immune reactivity was also reflected in the enhanced T + E scores in infected S1hopTum-llarvae, relative to their G1 counterparts. The increased tumor burden detected in naive S1hopTum-llarvae did not persist in S1hopTum-ladults. Collectively, these observations suggest that, with re-adaptation to normal gravity, the inflammatory effects of spaceflight are transient and reversible. The highly inflamed state ofhopTum-lanimals provided physiological insights into the modest changes in wasp virulence due to spaceflight. Wasp success, wasp virulence, and gene expression changes The virulence properties of both parasites also appeared to be largely maintained in space. This conclusion is based on (a) comparable yields of parasites in space versus ground cultures, (b) relatively stronger effects ofLb17on the T + E score compared toLh14, and (c) stronger transcriptional activation ofDrosomycin(Drs) in S1 hosts afterLb17infection but not afterLh14infection (Figures S3F and S3G). It is intriguing that S0 wasps of both species were less effective at increasing the T + E score in both G1 and S1hopTum-lhosts. This result suggests that the space environment did affect wasp physiology or virulence; the latter interpretation being consistent with reported increases in microbial virulence in space.31,32 A clear molecular explanation for differences in S0 versus G0 wasps was not apparent from the molecular analysis of wasp EV gene transcription. Transcript levels of only 29/312Lb17EV genes were significantly affected with all but one gene being downregulated. Only one of the two predicted RhoGAP superfamily genes shares structural similarity with the known LbGAP virulence protein,49and even its expression was weakly downregulated in space. The transcription of only 5/398Lh14EV transcripts was differentially affected, with only one gene (lacking annotation) showing ∼ 5-fold upregulation. None of these genes is currently implicated inLh14virulence. Furthermore, in anex vivoassay,Lh14venom from S0 wasps was no different in its ability to distort lamellocytes thanLh14venom from G0 wasps. The abundance and distribution of G0 and S0Lh14EVs in the dorsal vessel and lymph gland lobes of infected animals further suggest that the integrity of S0Lh14EV is comparable to that of controls. It is possible that the cumulative effects of differential gene expression changes contributed to differences between S0 and G0 wasps. Alternatively, S0 wasps may differ in their oviposition behavior, affecting the quantity of venom introduced into the host. Spaceflight experiments with live organisms are constrained by the weather, the logistics of the launch and retrieval protocols, the duration of the mission, the physical conditions within the ISS module, and available crew time. This study faced all these constraints. Although the 34-day mission duration aligned well with the overall goals of our experiment, by the end of the mission, the number of G0/S0 larvae was insufficient to set up infections with G0/S0 wasps. (Available G0/S0 larvae were dissected to examine lymph gland hemocyte morphologies [Figure S5].) It is quite likely that the effects of infection on the T + E values in G0/S0 hosts (infected with G0/S0 wasps) would be stronger than what we observed in G1/S1 hosts. The availability of fresh fly media for culturing naive G0/S0 adult flies, born in space or on ground, would have ensured sufficient numbers of larval hosts for these infection experiments, a strong consideration for designing future experiments.

Experimental model and study participant details Experimental design and sample preparation D. melanogasterstrainsy1w1andy w hopTum-lmsn-GAL4; UAS-mCD8-GFP(hopTum-lmsn > GFP),24and wasp speciesL. boulardistrain 17 (Lb17) andL. heterotomastrain 14 (Lh14),8were included in the ground control and flight experiments. ThehopTum-lstrain carries a dominant point mutation in the human Janus kinase (JAK) homolog,hopscotch.22This mutation confers constitutive JAK-STAT signaling, which drives hematopoietic proliferation and differentiation in larval stages; small, melanized tumors form that can be scored in adult flies. In this strain, themisshapen(msn) promoter directs Gal4 expression to lamellocytes.62Expression of theUAS-mCD8-GFPtransgene helps visualize lamellocytes, which make up the bulk of the tumors. Extensive pre-flight testing was done to estimate the diet volume and insect numbers for optimal growth during the 34-day flight period. Six conditions (two fly-only cultures, four fly/wasp co-cultures) were distributed among six VFBs (Figure 1). The fly-only cultures were reared in polystyrene vials containing 12 mL ± 1 mL fly food, while the co-culture vials contained 10 mL ± 1 mL fly food. The difference in fly food volume accommodated the respective life histories of the two insect species; unlike flies that depend on fly food medium, wasps consume the growing fly larvae and pupae. This volume of fly food supported insect growth for 34 days while keeping carbon dioxide production to a minimum. Prior to launch,y wfly-only cultures were initiated with 8 female and 5 male flies. ThehopTum-lcultures were similarly initiated with 20 female and 10 male flies. Fly-wasp co-cultures were set up simultaneously by first adding the flies to vials for three days, whereupon the flies were removed and adult wasps introduced. For they wco-cultures, 30 adult females and 15 adult males were added to each polystyrene vial for egg-laying. ForhopTum-legg-lays, 35 females and fifteen males were used. Fifteen egg-lays were made for each genotype, and 15 female and 15 male wasps were added to each egg-lay a day prior to launch. Six VFBs, each with 15 vials, were placed inside a CTB before the launch of the SpaceX-14 mission to the ISS (Figure 1). The mission was launched at 20:30 UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) on April 2nd, 2018. Wasp infection modifies fly development; it takes 20–25 days for wasps to develop into adults, while naive flies complete their development in 10–15 days. Weather-related issues delayed the original mission time from 31 days to 34 days. The ISS crew installed the samples into the Columbus Module endcone with the CTB lid open to promote air exchange between the VFBs and cabin air, where they remained until approximately two days prior to their return to Earth. Samples remained at ambient temperature (∼22°C). Temperature and humidity data in each VFB were collected throughout the flight mission. The radiation dosimeter on the ISS was the COL1A2 Radiation Assessment Detector, ISS-RAD, that detects charged particles.63Insects remained in the VFBs throughout the mission until their return on the Dragon capsule. A full-scale, near-synchronous ground control was conducted that was staggered 48 h from launch, using the environmental data streamed to a Space Station Processing Facility Environmental Simulator at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC). The ground control samples were manually set to recapitulate the temperature and humidity conditions of the space samples. While the temperatures between space and ground samples were similar for the duration of the experiment, the relative humidity of space samples was higher by 20–25% than that of ground samples. This was attributed to reduced convection in the microgravity environment, making it more difficult for moisture to evaporate quickly. The Dragon capsule was unberthed at 13:22 UTC on May 5th, 2018, and splashdown in the Pacific Ocean occurred on the same day at 20:00, off the coast of Long Beach, CA, from where samples were flown to New York. Ground control samples were similarly collected from KSC and flown to New York. Dissections, staining, and imaging Three-day egg-lays of G0/S0hopTum-ladult flies (described above) were set up at 25°C. Three to five wandering third-instar larvae were used per hemocyte smear for each replicate; three biological replicates were performed. Samples were incubated with rabbit anti-phospho-histone H3 antibody (1:200, Millipore Sigma), which was visualized with goat anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase-linked secondary antibody (1:5000, Thermo Scientific). Antibody binding was visualized by alkaline phosphatase staining (125 μg/mL BCIP and 250 μg/mL NBT, from Promega). The percentage of phospho-histone H3-positive macrophages was calculated by dividing the number of phospho-histone H3-positive macrophages by the total number of macrophages over six visual fields. Cells were scored using a Zeiss Axioplan light microscope. Tumors in randomly chosen G0 and S0hopTum-ladults (20 males and 5–10 females, ∼22°C) were scored 6.5 days (25°C) after their return. The G1 and S1 progeny of these G0 and S0hopTum-lflies was reared at 27°C, and their abdominal tumors were similarly scored 18.5 days post egg-lay.24Using a dissecting microscope, abdominal tumors were categorized as follows: small (< 0.5 body segment), medium (0.5–1 body segment), and large (> 1 body segment). Small-, medium-, and large-sized tumors were arbitrarily weighed as 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and all tumors in each animal were recorded. The average number of tumor structures per animal was determined by dividing the sum of all tumors in each replicate by the total number of animals scored. Three biological replicates were performed for both S0/G0 and S1/G1 comparisons. A Student’sttest was used to determine if the averages of two datasets differed significantly from each other. Infection and larval host immunity assay Egg-lays of G0/S0hopTum-lflies were set up with the same number of flies used in flight. Larval progeny, raised at 25°C for 3 days, were exposed to 10 male and 10 female G0 and S0Lb17orLh14wasps for 8 h. For each condition, hosts of the same strain were taken from more than one vial to randomize samples and ensure robust egg-laying. Similarly, wasps of the same species from different vials were combined for infections. Each experiment was replicated 3–4 times. Infected larvae were randomly selected and examined under a dissecting microscope 3–5 days later for the presence of either melanotic tumors or melanized parasite-induced encapsulation reactions.hopTum-ltumors and parasite capsules differ in shape; tumors are globular, while capsules are typically sickle-shaped and surround a wasp egg or wasp larva. These structures can fragment into smaller, melanized pieces, making it difficult to distinguish them. Regardless of their identity, they were classified based on size: (a) specks (similar in appearance to melanized crystal cells), (b) small melanized structures, or (c) large melanized structures. To quantify spaceflight’s effects on these reactions, an arbitrary score was assigned as follows: 1–3 specks, 4–8 specks, and > 8 specks were assigned a value of 0.5, 0.75, or 1, respectively. Small- and large-melanized structures were assigned a value of 1 and 4, respectively. Where clear encapsulation reactions (with evidence of a wasp egg) were observed, the structure was also assigned a value of 4. A composite tumor and encapsulation (T + E) score was calculated from 16 to 29 G1/S1 Lb17-or Lh14-infectedhopTum-llarvae. Uninfected G1/S1hopTum-llarvae (70–89 animals) served as controls. Pairwise comparisons of the average T + E scores were made using the Mann-Whitney U test for unpaired samples. For RNA-Seq experiments (technique reviewed in68), samples were flash-frozen in dry ice and stored at −80°C. Bulk RNA-Seq analysis was performed on RNA prepared from four replicates of (a) ground control (G0) and space-flown (S0) adult flies; (b) G0 and S0 adult wasps; and (c) G1 and S1 larvae. The RNA/protein purification plus kit from Norgen Biotek Corp. was used for RNA preparation, and the extracted total RNA was stored in Norgen RNA isolation kit elution buffer. For adult flies, three males and females each, of (a) G0y w; (b) S0y w; (c) G0hopTum-l; (d) S0hopTum-lwere used for extraction. RNA preparations of G0 and S0Lb17andLh14wasps were made from three females and three males. Larval RNA was isolated from G1 and S1y wanimals. In addition, RNA was also extracted fromhopTum-llarvae as follows: (a) uninfected G1; (b) uninfected S1; (c) G0Lb-infected G1 hosts; (d) S0Lb-infected G1 hosts; (e) G0Lb-infected S1 hosts; (f) S0Lb-infected S1 hosts; (g) G0Lh-infected G1 hosts; (h) S0Lh-infected G1 hosts; (i) G0Lh-infected S1 hosts; and (j) S0Lh-infected S1 hosts. The RNA from G0 and S0 adult flies and wasps was processed at Genewiz, Inc. as follows: After poly (A)+ extraction, libraries for adult flies and wasps were prepared using the non-stranded NEBNext Ultra RNA Library Prep Kit E7775, following the manufacturer’s instructions (NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA). The libraries were validated using the Agilent TapeStation. Libraries were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 machine for HiSeq 2 × 150 bp, single index, at Genewiz. Data output was ∼300–350 million raw paired-end reads per lane. The total RNA prepared from G1 and S1 larval samples (stored at −80°C) was processed as follows at NASA’s GeneLab Samples Processing Laboratory. The RNA concentration was determined using a Qubit 4.0 Fluorometer, and 400 ng of each sample was used for poly (A)+ extraction. RNA-Seq sequencing libraries were prepared using the E7775 NEBNext Ultra RNA Library Prep Kit, as above. The libraries were validated by using Agilent TapeStation D1000 tape. Quantification was performed using the Qubit 4.0 Fluorometer. Libraries were pooled and sequenced on the Illumina iSeq 100 sequencer to confirm library balancing and screen for ribosomal RNA. The final library pool was sequenced on Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencer using S1 Reagent Kit v1.5 (300 cycles, 2 lanes). Processing ofDrosophilaRNA-Seq data The reads from adult fly and larval fly RNA were analyzed using version D of NASA GeneLab’s RNA-Seq processing pipeline (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-D.md). For this, the raw fastq files of the adult fly RNA-Seq reads obtained from Genewiz were transferred to GeneLab. Raw fastq files of both sample sets were assessed for percent rRNA (0.30–0.42% rRNA in adults; 0.20–2.73% rRNA in larvae) using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.3.2) and filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.7) powered by Cutadapt (version 2.6). Raw and trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.11) was used to generate MultiQC reports. RSEM raw gene counts were imported to R (version 4.0.3) with tximport (version 1.18.0) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.30.0)69median of ratios method. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.0.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.30.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test, and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p value. False discovery rate (adjusted p value) corrections were performed using Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing adjustment. Gene annotations were assigned using the following Bioconductor and annotation packages: STRINGdb (v2.2.0), PANTHER.db (v1.0.10), and org.Dm.e.g.,.db (v3.12.0). Genes were considered differentially expressed if adjusted p < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed in R (version 4.0.3) using log (2)-transformed count data from unnormalized and normalized counts. PCA plots were generated for each set of count data using ggplot2 (version 3.3.3). Volcano plots were created using EnhancedVolcano (version 1.8.0), with adjusted p < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1 cutoff values specified. KEGG enrichment analyses for adult samples Analysis of top, essential, and pathway DEGs The most highly modulated Top DEGs in the adult fly samples were identified by sorting log (2)-FC for each comparison and then filtering genes that met the adjusted p value significance p < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1. From this list, the top 50 upregulated or downregulated genes were identified for each comparison, yielding ∼280 genes. Annotations and other functional information for these ∼280 genes were examined in FlyBase37and genes with clear orthologs or paralogs and known or predicted functions (172 genes) were retained. Clustering of these 172 Top DEGs revealed six major expression profiles. The magnitude of log (2)-FC for these genes, in both directions, ranged from ∼3- to 12-fold. For Essential DEGs, a list of 1,024 genes that were identified experimentally in P element insertion screens was compiled.73,74,75,76Of these 1,024 genes, 137 were differentially expressed in at least one of four comparisons. The DIOPT-DIST tool,41which predicts human orthologs of fly genes and diseases or traits associated with the human orthologs identified through GWAS or OMIM databases, was used to determine the disease relevance of these essential genes. Genes in the JAK-STAT, Toll, and Imd pathways were compiled from KEGG and/or FlyBase. Additional pathway target genes were added from the primary literature.34,77,78 Processing of parasite RNA-Seq reads Raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.7) powered by Cutadapt (version 3.7). Raw and trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports.L. heterotomaBowtie2 and RSEM indices were built using Bowtie2 (version 2.5.0) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, and theLh14GAJC contig transcriptome reference from NCBI (https://sra-download.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/traces/wgs03/wgs_aux/GA/JC/GAJC01/GAJC01.1.fsa_nt.gz).L. boulardiBowtie2 and RSEM indices were built using Bowtie2 (version 2.5.0) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, withLb17GAJA contig transcriptome reference from NCBI (https://sra-download.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/traces/wgs03/wgs_aux/GA/JA/GAJA01/GAJA01.1.fsa_nt.gz). Trimmed reads were aligned to the respective wasp parasite species Bowtie2 transcriptome reference with Bowtie2 (version 2.5.0), and aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to none. Quantification data was imported to R (version 4.1.2) with tximport (version 1.22.0) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0) using the median of ratios method. Normalized transcript counts were subject to differential expression analysis in R (version 4.1.2) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared using the Wald test, and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p value. The numbers of significantly differentially expressed transcripts (adjusted p < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1) forLb17andLh14were 293 and 310, respectively. The presence of conserved protein domains or motifs in these differentially expressedLb17andLh14DEGs was performed via CDD searches (database version CDD v3.20 - 59693 PSSMs; and expect value threshold 0.01) (Tables S2andS3). Principal Component Analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.2) using log (2)-transformed count data from unnormalized and normalized counts. PCA plots were generated for each set of count data using ggplot2 (version 3.3.5). Volcano plots were created using EnhancedVolcano (version 1.12.0) with an adjusted p value < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1 cutoff values specified. Identification and analysis of parasite EV transcripts An estimate of the overallLb17EV proteome size was obtained as follows: the 383LbGsequences were used to tblastn-search theGAJA00000000sequences.47This search identified 316 non-redundant EV protein-encoding GAJA sequences (E ≤ 1 e−50, query coverage ≥70%, percent identity ≥70%; NCBI BLAST+ (v 2.7.1).15,79,80,81Some homologs were not identified due to strain differences; nevertheless, the analysis revealed that most of theLbGEV proteins are expressed in theLb17female abdomen. Since theLh14EV proteome is already characterized,11,12tblastn analyses were not necessary, and EV genes were filtered from the 310Lh14DEGs (Table 2). SEM preparation of venom EVs and imaging Thirty venom glands of G0 and S0 wasps were dissected in 100 μL of ice-cold PBS and fixed in 100 μL of 4% glutaraldehyde in 0.1M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4 (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Venom glands were processed for scanning electron microscopy imaging as follows: Ten drops of 2% osmium tetroxide aqueous solution (Electron Microscopy Sciences) were added to the sample on ice for 20 min. The sample was filtered on a wet 25-mm polycarbonate Whatman membrane filter (0.1 μm pore size), covered with a second wet filter, and suctioned with the sample in between the filters. The filters were clamped between O-rings and quickly immersed in ice-cold distilled water. The filters were then rinsed in distilled water five times, 3 min for each rinse. This was followed by dehydration in a graded (10%, 30%, 50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 100%) series of ethanol for 5 min each. The filters were then critical point dried (Balzers, CPD 030) in liquid carbon dioxide five times, 3–5 min each. Dehydrated and dried samples were mounted on aluminum SEM specimen mount stubs (Electron Microscopy Sciences) using conductive carbon adhesive tabs (Electron Microscopy Sciences) and stored in a 60°C oven for 2 h or longer. Samples on the filter were coated with gold/palladium (Leica, EM ACE600) right before being observed on the Zeiss SUPRA 55VP scanning electron microscope. These procedures were carried out at the CCNY and CUNY ASRC core facilities. FortyhopTum-llarvae were bled in 200 μL of 7% bovine serum albumin. 50 μL of this hemolymph preparation was aliquoted into individual chambers of a 4-chamber slide and allowed to incubate at room temperature for 1 h. Venom was extracted from G0 and S0Lh14wasps, and protein was quantified using the Bradford method. An appropriate volume of the venom extract containing 30 μg of venom protein was added to the slide chamber withhopTum-lhemocytes. Phosphate-buffered saline (20 mM, pH 7.4) was used as a control. After incubation for 4 h at 25°C, excess liquid was removed by aspiration, hemocytes were air-dried at room temperature and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. After washing, cells were stained successively with rhodamine-labeled phalloidin (R415 Life Technologies) and Hoechst 33258 pentahydrate (Invitrogen) for 15 min each at room temperature. Samples were washed three times with PBS, and stained cells were mounted in Vectashield for confocal microscopy. Lamellocytes with bipolar morphology (i.e., spindle-shaped GFP-positive lamellocytes with two pointed ends) were manually scored. Experiments were replicated three times and the Student’sttest statistic was applied to determine the significance. Isolation and characterization ofL. heterotomamutants G0/S0Lb17andLh14male wasps were mated with females from lab cultures, and their grandsons were examined for viable mutations affecting wing color, wing venation, wing morphology, eye color, eye morphology, and antennal morphology. Mutant grandsons were not obtained from the G0/S0Lb17or G0Lh14screens. OneLh14grandson with golden wings (instead of the normal gray wings) was identified. Thisaurum1male was mated with “lab” females; the progeny was “selfed” to obtain additional mutant males. For a pure-breeding stock, putative heterozygous unmated females were collected by placing pupae into Falcon 3072 96-well plates (Becton Dickinson) 1–3 days prior to their emergence. Strips of Scotch Tape (0.9 cm wide) were used to seal the wells. Theaurum1strain was homozygous viable, and a pure-breeding stock was established. A second mutant phenotype was observed in theaurum1wasp culture. The posterior wing margins of thisaurum1wasp were angular instead of the normal round ends. This mutant,kona1, assorted from theaurum1mutation, and was similarly homozygous viable but a pure-breeding stock could not be established as homozygouskona1females could not infect hosts. To establish this, 14 unmated, or 11kona1male-mated, heterozygous or homozygouskona1females, were introduced toy whosts. Ten males were used for the matings. Larval hosts were dissected to assess the presence of eggs. To examine ifaurum1andkona1mutations assort independently, unmated homozygousaurum1females were mated withkona1males. Thirty-six unmated double heterozygous females were used for two rounds ofy winfections. Over 1,000 male progeny of the four expected genotypes were scored. Ovaries from wild type, heterozygous, or homozygouskona1females were fixed in ethanol, mounted in 50% glycerol, and imaged on a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U microscope attached to a Diagnostic Instruments Inc. camera and NIS Elements Imaging Software 64.0 bit 3.22.14. Ovipositors of 10 wild type and 30 homozygouskona1females were gently pulled out using sharp forceps, briefly dipped in 70% ethanol and PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and washed in PBS, before mounting in Vectashield. Images were acquired with a Leica Aperio CS2 microscope. We support inclusive, diverse, and equitable conduct of research.

Values in bold identify genes included in Table 2. Original transcriptomic data (raw read counts and FASTQ files) from bulk RNA-Seq experiments on hosts and parasites have been deposited in and can be accessed from NASA’s publicly available Open Science Data Repository (https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo). Accession numbers are listed in thekey resources table. Version D of NASA GeneLab’s bioinformatics pipeline, available on GitHub, was used to processDrosophilaRNA-Seq reads. A DOI is listed in thekey resources table. A modified version of theDrosophilapipeline was used to analyzeL. boulardiandL. heterotomareads. Those scripts are available with the supplemental materialData S1(L.boulardi_ L.heterotoma_RNAseq_processing_scripts.zip).
