E-mail:a.matin@stanford.edu Received 2009 Dec 9; Accepted 2010 Apr 21; Issue date 2010 Jul. We describe here a new application of a recently developed device (8-10,13), the “BioFlux” device consisting of microfluidic channels for biofilm growth. Other microfluidic devices have recently been used for biofilm formation (14,19,21,23), but none of them has been used for HTP screening. The BioFlux device permits rapid measurement of the fluorescence of flow biofilms with a plate reader, which permits initial HTP screening of the viability of such biofilms. UropathogenicE. coli(UPEC) strain AMG1, a clinical isolate obtained from the Infectious Disease Department at the Stanford Medical Center (25), was cultured in Lennox L broth (LB).Pseudomonas aeruginosaPAO1 andPseudomonas fluorescens700830 were cultured in Bacto tryptic soy broth (TSB). To obtain a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing strain, UPEC was transformed by electroporation with plasmid pFPV25.1 (37). PAO1 carrying pSMC2 (4) for GFP expression was graciously provided by Terry Machen (University of California, Berkeley). Ampicillin was added to the medium to maintain the expression vectors (100 and 16 μg/ml for UPEC/pFPV25.1 and PAO1/pSMC2, respectively). LB agar and Difco tryptic soy agar (TSA) were used for plating the UPEC and PAO1 strains, respectively. Growth and determination of the viability of microtiter plate (“static”) biofilms. Biofilm growth and determination of viability for the BioFlux flowthrough device. BioFlux high-throughput system for screening of flow biofilm viability and other parameters. (A) Photograph of BioFlux system. The device consists of a pneumatic pump connected via an interface to the top of a BioFlux plate (shown on the microscope stage). (B) Schematic diagram of the BioFlux plate, showing 48 wells and 24 independent channels connecting pairs of wells. (C) Schematic diagram showing the inlet and outlet wells containing fresh and spent media, respectively. Pneumatic pressure delivered to the top of the inlet well pushes fresh medium through the microfluidic channel (containing the biofilm) and into the outlet well. The biofilm can be viewed with a microscope or scanned with a plate reader. (D) Close-up of two microfluidic channels (black lines). Each channel has a serpentine region (one serpentine region is enclosed in a box) to provide sufficient back pressure and a chamber for microscope viewing (arrow). Two strategies were employed to provide fluorescence for measurement of viability. One strategy involved the use of GFP-expressing strains and staining with PI (30 μM in 0.85% saline) for 15 min at a flow rate of 93 μl/h (997 μm/s), followed by a 20-min rinse with saline. The second strategy involved bacteria not expressing GFP and viability staining with LIVE/DEADBacLight stain (Invitrogen). TheBacLight stain consists of SYTO9 (5 μM in 0.85% saline) and PI (30 μM in 0.85% saline), which were pumped through the channels (at the same flow rate and for the same time as described above), which were then rinsed with saline for 20 min. Viability of PAO1 BioFlux biofilms determined using SYTO9-PI and GFP-PI. Treatment with low levels (0.01 and 0.1 μg/ml) of gentamicin increased SYTO9 uptake and green fluorescence, resulting in enhancement of false-positive viability (>100%), which did not occur with GFP-PI fluorescence. The StudentttestPvalue is shown for each concentration of gentamicin; aPvalue of <0.05 indicates that there is a statistically significant difference. Biofilm formation and development in a BioFlux channel. The images are phase-contrast images obtained after flow began (the flow was from left to right; each channel was 370 μm wide) and show initial attachment (0.5 and 1 h), microcolony formation (2 and 3 h), and development (4, 5, and 6.5 h) into fully formed biofilms (21 h). Quantification of viability by measurement of fluorescence. Flow cell biofilm viability is generally determined using the LIVE/DEADBacLight stain combined with imaging of green fluorescence and red fluorescence, which indicate live and dead cells, respectively. However, according to recent reports, this method can overestimate the number of viable cells remaining after treatment with low levels of antimicrobial agents, evidently due to changes in membrane permeability that facilitate disproportionate uptake of SYTO9 green (the green “viable” dye) (3,24). An alternate method to measure viability by fluorescence is to use green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing bacteria and the red fluorescent dye propidium iodide (PI) (24). The plate reader-based BioFlux viability screening method relied on the use of bacterial strains expressing GFP; for non-GFP-expressing bacteria another method, such as LIVE/DEADBacLight staining, must be used. However, theBacLight viability method, as reported previously for planktonic cells (3,24) and confirmed here for biofilms, is limited to treatments causing a relatively higher level of killing. This finding appears to limit use of the BioFlux to bacteria capable of expressing GFP. However, there are other possibilities. For example, the LIVE/DEAD stain is accurate for determination of viability where the level of killing is high, which is often the goal of HTP screening; another possibility is to use a fluorogenic substrate, such as 4-methylumbellyferyl-β-d-glucuronide (28), to measure biofilm metabolic activity. The BioFlux device is also likely to be useful in HTP screening of other biofilm parameters. One example is investigating expression of a fluorescently tagged protein under different conditions, such as fluid shear. Another example is determination of the formation or elimination of the extracellular matrix, which can be done by using poly-N-acetylglucosamine-binding wheat germ agglutinin-Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate (5).
