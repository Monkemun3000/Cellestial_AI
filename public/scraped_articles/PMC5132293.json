Tissues of C57Bl/6J mice were dissected and preserved at various time points post-euthanasia and stored at -80°C for up to 11 months. In some experiments, tissues were recovered from frozen carcasses which had been stored at -80°C up to 7 months. RNA quantity and quality was assessed by measuring RNA Integrity Number (RIN) values using an Agilent Bioanalyzer. Additionally, the quality of tissues was assessed by measuring activities of hepatic enzymes (catalase, glutathione reductase and GAPDH). Challenges continue to exist in regards to acquiring high quality samples from animal tissues despite recent technical advances. From the time spent collecting the samples to the use of stabilizing or preserving agents, and ultimately to the storage conditions and duration prior to actual analysis, each step is critical and requires attention. Timing plays a key role in obtaining high quality samples. Ideally, samples are harvested immediately post-euthanasia by trained and experienced staff, and the time between death and sample stabilization is minimized to limit sample degradation. If the samples are not analyzed at the time of euthanasia, then additional factors that may affect sample quality are of concern, including freezing rate and duration of storage. Understanding these challenges faced in the laboratory aids the researcher to optimize protocols to maximize sample quality and accomplish science objectives; translating those practices for use in the space environment, however, raises new challenges. In the studies reported here, we investigated various time points and storage conditions for retrieving tissues from mice, and then determined the impact that these conditions had on sample quality. By measuring RNA Integrity Number (RIN) and enzyme activities in tissues under various recovery scenarios, we have characterized and established an acceptable timeline for rodent tissue isolation, preservation, and storage to optimize science return from both ground based and on-orbit flight sample collection. Adult female C57Bl/6J mice from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) were used in all the experiments. All animals were euthanized by intraperitoneal injection of Euthasol (Virbac, Fort Worth, TX) followed by cervical dislocation. All efforts were made to minimize suffering. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the NASA Ames Research Center approved the animal care and experimental procedures. Fresh tissue samples: To provide positive control tissues representing preservation by standard laboratory conditions, spleens and livers were harvested immediately post-euthanasia then were either promptly (within 5 min) frozen in liquid nitrogen (liver) or preserved in RNAlater (spleen). To simulate the anticipated dissection timing by astronauts on-orbit, spleens were removed at 6 or 22 minutes after euthanasia, and livers were removed at 9 or 25 minutes post-euthanasia (Fig 1), then placed in cryovials (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Spleens were preserved in RNAlater (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and livers were frozen by embedding the cryovials in pelleted dry ice. Samples were either stored at -80°C for 3.5 mo (spleen) and 4.5 mo (liver), or for 11 mo prior to analysis. Fig 1. Experimental design schematic. Time-delay between euthanasia and stabilization: To bracket the possible time frames that the astronaut crew may need to dissect then preserve the samples, spleens were harvested at 1, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 minutes post-euthanasia and preserved in RNAlater. Livers were harvested from the same mice at 2, 25, 45, 65, 85, and 105 minutes post-euthanasia and frozen in dry ice. Samples were stored at -80°C for 1 month prior to analysis. Whole Carcass (WC): Mice were euthanized by intraperitoneal injection of Euthasol followed by cervical dislocation. The carcasses were then wrapped in two layers of foil and placed in Ziploc bags. The carcasses were frozen using an aluminum block that was pre-chilled with liquid nitrogen, to simulate the freezing kit used on-orbit, and transferred to a -80°C freezer for storage (up to 10 months). Various tissues (spleen, liver, heart, kidney, lung, brain, adrenal glands, eye, thymus, small intestine, large intestine, femur, tibia, hindlimb muscle, and bone marrow) were collected from 2.5, 4 and 6–7 month frozen WC after thawing at room temperature for 20–30 minutes, and then preserved in RNAlater. Positive control WC were immersed in liquid nitrogen immediately after euthanasia and were stored in a 80°C freezer for 4 and 6–7 months. Partially Dissected Carcass (PC): Spleens and livers were removed following euthanasia, and utilized for a different study. The dissected carcasses then were wrapped with two layers of aluminum foil, and sealed in a Ziploc bag before freezing on dry ice. The time from euthanasia to the carcass freezing in dry ice was about 2 hours. PC were stored at -80°C for 2.5 months prior to harvesting the tissues (brain, adrenal glands, eye, thymus, small intestine, hindlimb muscle, and bone marrow). PC were removed from the -80°C freezer, and placed at room temperature with the aluminum foils open for partial thawing to the extent that dissection commenced, which was up to 35 minutes after removal from -80°C. Tissues were preserved in RNAlater. RNA was extracted from homogenized tissues using TRIzol reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). RNA concentration and purity were assessed using a NanoDrop 2000 UV-Vis Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). RNA quality was measured by calculating the RNA integrity number (RIN) using the Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA), where a RIN of 10 is considered intact and 0 totally degraded RNA [20,21]. The analysis was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The activities of three hepatic enzymes (catalase, glutathione reductase and GAPDH) were measured to assess sample quality after various collection conditions. Catalase activity was measured using the colorimetric assay for Catalase (Oxford Biomedical Research, Oxford, MI) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and normalized to total protein levels (Thermo Scientific™Pierce™Micro BCA™Protein Assay Kit, Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL). Catalase protein levels were measured using the Catalase Human ELISA Kit (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), and specific activity of the enzyme calculated (U/μg catalase protein). Glutathione reductase activity levels were determined using the Glutathione Reductase (GR) Assay Kit (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) and GAPDH activity levels were determined using the colorimetric GAPDH assay kit (ScienCell Research Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA). The activity levels were also normalized by the total protein concentrations using the Micro BCA Protein Assay Kit. Positive controls were obtained according to standard laboratory protocols where dissections were followed by immersion of the samples in liquid nitrogen. RNA quality in tissues collected at various time points post-euthanasia Fig 2. Effects of preservation times post-euthanasia on RNA quality in spleen and liver. Spleens and livers were collected from up to 3 minutes (Positive Control), 9 minutes (Set 1), and 25 minutes (Set 2) post-euthanasia. Set 1 and 2 time points were selected to simulate anticipated dissection timing in microgravity. Spleens were preserved in RNAlater, and livers were frozen on dry ice. All samples were stored at -80°C, and analyzed after 3.5 months for spleen and 4.5 months for liver. RNA quality was measured by calculating the Bioanalyzer-based RNA integrity number (RIN) using the Bioanalyzer 2100. Samples harvested up to 25 minutes post-euthanasia, and stored for less than 5 months at -80°C, yielded RIN values greater than 8. Data sets were assessed for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test, followed by the Kruskal-Wallis test. Values shown are medians within interquartile (boxes) and full range (whiskers). Spleens: n = 4, 9, and 8 for Control, Set 1 and 2, respectively. Livers: n = 3, 10, and 10 for Control, Set 1 and 2, respectively. Fig 3. Effects of delayed dissections on RNA quality in spleens and livers. Spleens were collected at 1 (Positive Control), 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 minutes post-euthanasia, and were preserved in RNAlater. RNAlater-preserved spleen samples yielded high RIN values (RIN > 7.5) for all time points (A). Liver tissues from the same mice in (A) were collected at 2 (Positive Control), 25, 45, 65, 85, and 105 minutes post-euthanasia, and were frozen on dry ice. RNA quality in samples collected up to 45 minutes post-euthanasia were minimally affected, resulting in RIN values > 8. RIN value decreased by 24% in samples collected at 105 minutes post-euthanasia, compared to controls (B). All samples were stored at -80°C for 1 month prior to analysis. Data sets were assessed for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test, followed by the Dunn post-hoc test (Joint Ranks, compared to Control). Values shown are medians within interquartile (boxes) and full range (whiskers). (n = 4 for each time point). * p<0.05, ** p<0.01 Activity levels of three liver enzymes also were measured from the time-delayed dissections. Glutathione reductase (Fig 4a) and GAPDH (Fig 4b) levels were similar to those of the positive controls. Catalase activities were only moderately lower in the samples collected at 105 minutes after dissection compared to the control samples (Fig 4c). Overall, the activities of these enzymes in harvested liver tissues were not significantly affected by collection time or storage at -80°C for 1 month. Fig 4. Effects of time-delayed dissections on hepatic enzyme levels. Activities of three hepatic enzymes, glutathione reductase, GAPDH and catalase, were measured from samples collected at various times post-dissection. Glutathione reductase (A) and GAPDH (B) activity was similar to those of positive controls, with no significant effects observed at any time point. Catalase activities were similar to those of the positive controls; however, samples collected at 105 minutes post-euthanasia displayed significantly lower levels when compared to tissue collected at 65 minutes (C). Activity levels of glutathione reductase and GAPDH were normalized by the total protein concentrations. Catalase activity levels were normalized by catalase protein. Data sets were assessed for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test, followed by the one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s post hoc test. Values are means ± SD (n = 4). ** p<0.01 Effect of storage duration at -80°C on tissue quality To assess the influence of storage duration on sample quality, spleens and livers were collected per standard laboratory procedures (up to 5 minutes post-euthanasia), and then stored at -80°C for 1, 3.5, 4.5, and 11 months prior to analysis. At all time points investigated, no significant degradation was found in the RNA quality of any of the tissue samples (RIN > 8) (Fig 5). These data demonstrate that quality of the tissues can be maintained for up to 11 months when the tissues are stored at -80°C. Fig 5. Effects of long duration storage at -80°C on RNA quality in spleen and liver. Spleens and livers were collected up to 5 minutes post-euthanasia. Spleens were preserved in RNAlater, and livers were frozen on dry ice. Samples were stored at -80°C for 1, 3.5, and 11 months for spleen, and 1, 4.5, and 11 months for liver. Samples stored up to 11 months at -80°C resulted in RIN values greater than 8. Data sets were assessed for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test, followed by the Kruskal-Wallis test. Values shown are medians within interquartile (boxes) and full range (whiskers) (n = 4 for all months except for n = 3 for Liver 12 months). * p<0.05 Integrity of RNA harvested from whole frozen carcasses Fig 6. Integrity of RNA harvested from whole frozen carcasses. Whole frozen carcasses (WC) were frozen using an aluminum block that was pre-chilled with liquid nitrogen to simulate the freezing kit used on-orbit (2.5, 4 and 6–7 month WC) prior to being placed into a -80°C freezer. Spleen, liver, heart, kidney, and lung were collected within 30 minutes post thawing of the WC, and preserved in RNAlater prior to analysis. Data sets were assessed for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test, followed by the one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s post hoc test. Values are means ± SD (n = 9 for 2.5 month, except n = 8 for lung; n = 4, 5, 6, 3, 4 for 4 month spleen, liver, heart, kidney and lung, respectively; n = 3 for 6–7 month). * p<0.05; ** p<0.01 Using a separate group of WC we dissected numerous additional tissues and determined the RNA quality. High quality RNA was recovered from various tissues (brain, adrenal glands, eye, thymus and hindlimb muscle); RIN values were greater than 7.5 in all tissues (Fig 7a). Small intestine and bone marrow, however, showed severe degradation (RIN values less than 3,) despite rapid preservation in RNAlater at the time of dissection. Additionally, femur, large intestine, and tibia yielded RNA with RIN values less than 5 (Fig 7a). These findings suggest that after long term storage in -80C high quality RNA can be recovered from select tissues of whole carcasses. Fig 7. The effects on RNA quality in various tissues recovered from whole and partially dissected carcasses stored at -80°C for 2.5 months. Tissue samples were removed from the frozen carcasses for RIN analysis. Tissues were preserved in RNAlater prior to analysis. Brain, adrenal glands, eye, thymus, and hindlimb muscles resulted in high RIN values in both WC (A) and PC (B). RNA quality in WC and PC small intestine and bone marrow samples were severely degraded, resulting in RIN values < 3 (A and B). Values are means ± SD (n = 8 for Fig 7A, except n = 7 adrenal gland, n = 5 femur and bone marrow, and n = 4 tibia; n = 4 for Fig 7B, except n = 3 adrenal gland). Integrity of RNA harvested from partially dissected carcasses Tissues preserved in RNAlater showed significant improvement in RNA quality compared to tissues immersed in liquid nitrogen [22]. In the present study, we observed that freshly harvested spleens preserved in RNAlater showed a higher RIN (RIN >8) compared to spleens dissected from frozen carcasses (RIN = ~5.5). In the absence of RNAlater, liver samples yielded relatively high quality RNA (RIN >6.5). Sample quality collected under various conditions varied depending on tissue type and endpoint measured. Spleens collected up to 100 minutes after euthanasia yielded high quality RNA since they were preserved in RNAlater. Liver tissues collected up to 65 minutes after euthanasia, also yielded high quality samples. However, liver samples showed a significant decline in RNA quality (RIN <8) after 65 minutes post-euthanasia. These data demonstrate that tissues collected with appropriate timing that is typical for laboratory dissections (i.e., up to 30 minutes between euthanasia and tissue collection) can yield samples of acceptable quality to achieve exceptional science return, as expected [23]. These findings are consistent with those of others who showed that RNA samples from tonsils can be stable for several hours, and even after overnight storage at room temperature, RNA did not significantly degrade [6]. However, long-term storage (e.g. 16 hours) at room temperature could result in significant changes in expression levels of some genes. In addition to the time delay in tissue collection and storage, the repetitive freezing and thawing of the snap-frozen tissues could affect RNA integrity. However, RNA degradation in frozen liver tissue did not occur in seconds or over few minutes, but over 30 minutes of thawing at room temperature [18]. Thus, if tissues accidentally are thawed for a brief period, those tissues do not necessarily have to be discarded from gene expression analyses. Schoor et al. report that partially degraded RNA may still be usable even though suboptimal quality [24]. Furthermore, it was reported that RNA with low RIN still allows for reliable monitoring of mRNA expression by qPCR if small amplicon sizes are targeted, although large amplicons failed to generate measurable expression values [25]. These findings, along with our own, allow investigators in the future to use carcass that have been preserved by freezing, to address questions that may arise at a later time.
