Vanapalli (siva.vanapalli@ttu.edu) Muscle strength is a functional measure of quality of life in humans. Declines in muscle strength are manifested in diseases as well as during inactivity, aging, and space travel. With conserved muscle biology, the simple genetic modelC. elegansis a high throughput platform in which to identify molecular mechanisms causing muscle strength loss and to develop interventions based on diet, exercise, and drugs. In the clinic, standardized strength measures are essential to quantitate changes in patients; however, analogous standards have not been recapitulated in theC. elegansmodel since force generation fluctuates based on animal behavior and locomotion. Here, we report a microfluidics-based system for strength measurement that we call ‘NemaFlex’, based on pillar deflection as the nematode crawls through a forest of pillars. We have optimized the micropillar forest design and identified robust measurement conditions that yield a measure of strength that is independent of behavior and gait. Validation studies using a muscle contracting agent and mutants confirm that NemaFlex can reliably score muscular strength inC. elegans. Additionally, we report a scaling factor to account for animal size that is consistent with a biomechanics model and enables comparative strength studies of mutants. Taken together, our findings anchor NemaFlex for applications in genetic and drug screens, for defining molecular and cellular circuits of neuromuscular function, and for dissection of degenerative processes in disuse, aging, and disease. Skeletal muscle provides the contractile system critical for animal locomotion across phyla. The conserved biology of muscle includes sarcomere composition and organization, the calcium-initiated contractile mechanism, and the ATP-driven translocation of actin and myosin for force generation1,2. A powerful indicator of muscle health is strength —a measure of maximum force that can be voluntarily exerted for a given task. Diagnosis of muscle degenerative disorders such as muscular dystrophy relies on strength and physical performance tests in the clinic3,4. Similar diagnostic evaluation is crucial for, sarcopenia and dynapenia, the age-related progressive loss of muscle mass and muscle strength, respectively5,6. Additionally, muscle atrophy and strength declines are a major impediment for manned deep space exploration7. Given conservation of basic muscle biology, simple genetic models such asDrosophila melanogaster8and the 959-celledCaenorhabditis elegans9,10constitute attractive platforms with which to decipher the molecular mechanisms of age-10,11, disease-12, or microgravity-13associated muscle decline. For example, studies inC. eleganshave led to important new insights into the assembly, maintenance, and regulation of striated muscle10,14–16, with the loss-of-function mutants in sarcomeric proteins showing reduced capacity to swim or crawl17–19. These model organisms also offer a powerful means with which to investigate how diet, exercise protocols, and drug interventions may combat muscle dysfunction. Still, the notion of muscle strength and its measurement in these simple models has remained elusive. A technical challenge in reporting muscle strength in invertebrate models is that its definition crucially depends on system geometry and measurement protocol. As a result, even though forces on the order of microNewtons have been reported to be exerted byC. elegans20–26; the approaches used yield different values of forces due to worm locomotion, body posture, and behavior. Without a measurement protocol that is reproducible and system geometry that is validated, fluctuating forces cannot be used to extract a meaningful metric for strength. Additionally, the influence of animal size on force production has not been established, even though it is well recognized that animals from the same culture as well as mutants can have different body sizes. Thus, force measures that reveal muscular strength independent of animal behavior and approaches to compensate forces for variations in animal size, have not been established in theC. elegansmodel. In humans, precisely defined strength metrics such as maximum voluntary force (MVF) and one repetition maximum (1RM) are absolutely essential to quantitate and compare subjects, which constitutes the clinical basis of muscle physiology investigations27(Fig. 1a). Here, MVF is defined as the peak force recorded for a particular set of muscle (leg extensor, elbow extensor etc.) during one trial28,29, and 1RM is defined as the maximum weight that a person can lift for one repetition30. It is imperative to recapitulate analogous metrics and standardize them in theC. elegansmodel for the field to move forward with genetic studies on problems ranging from Duchenne muscular dystrophy to muscle wasting due to aging to metabolic disorders. (a) Human muscle function is measured in terms of maximum voluntary force (MVF) during a standardized knee extensor test, where the peak force exerted by the quadriceps muscle is recorded using a force sensor. An equivalent measure of maximum exertable force inC. elegansis currently unavailable. (b) Image of the NemaFlex device filled with green food dye for highlighting the arena and the ports. Scale bar, 1 cm. (c) Schematic showing theC. elegansstrength measurement apparatus including the chamber for housing worms, deformable pillar arrays, microscope objective for visualizing pillar deflection, and crawling nematode. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) picture of the pillars (inset). Scale bar, 100 μm. (d) Schematic showing interaction with a pillar by the worm body (exaggerated view). The pillar is deflected due to the action of the body wall muscles (shown in red and green). Parameters defined inEqn. (1)are shown with actual values beinga= 38.3 ± 0.4,h= 71.8 ± 2.9,c= 27.6 ± 2.9 andD= 50 -70 μm (for WT, age = 60 – 84 hrs). Here we define a microfluidics-based system for strength measurement in nematodes by pillar deflection that we call “NemaFlex” (Fig. 1b-d). We study the effects of micropillar forest design and animal behavior to identify robust measurement conditions that define maximum exertable force (MEF) as a measure that is reproducible and insensitive to animal locomotion and behavior. Our force-velocity analysis in animals experiencing different confinements and validation studies using a muscle contracting agent mutants indeed show that MEF is analogous to MVF measured in humans. We also report a scaling factor to correct MEF for animal size, thus establishing NemaFlex as a quantitative and reproducible system for measurement of muscle strength among individual worms, mutants, and/or prospectively in an individual worm with age or experimental intervention. Our findings establish the means to exploit drug, genetic, and experiential outcomes that may define molecular and cellular circuits of muscle use and maintenance, which in turn might inspire therapies for extended muscle healthspan. C. eleganswere maintained onE. coliOP50 bacterial lawns using standard protocol31. Wild-type (WT) animals were Bristol isolate (N2). Other strains used in this study wereunc-52(e669),unc-112(r367ts)V,unc-17(e245), andlon-2(e678)X. Age synchronized, well-fed young adult animals were used for all force measurement experiments unless otherwise indicated. Age synchronized populations were obtained using a standard protocol. Approximately 20 gravid adult animals were transferred to a NGM plate (previously seeded with bacteriaE. coliOP50) by hand picking and allowed to lay eggs on the bacteria lawn for 3 hours. After 3 hours, gravid adults were removed from the plate. Hatched worms were cultured at 20°C. The age of animals whose strength was evaluated is mentioned in either the main text or figure captions and is given as the time from hatching. Microfluidic device fabrication Geometrical details of the composite arena and measured gait and velocity in different regions of the arena. HereD= 65.1 ± 3.2 μm. Age of the worm is 84 hours after hatching. The height of the pillars in the composite arena is 83.6 ± 1.8 μm. All the master molds used in this study were fabricated using the following procedure. A two-layer mold was fabricated in SU-8 2050 negative photoresist (Microchem) on a 3\" silicon wafer as substrate (University Wafer)22. First, a 25-μm-tall, oval-shaped flat layer was fabricated, which forms the boundary of the arena. On top of this layer, a second layer of 75-μm height was fabricated with cylindrical holes that form the micropillars. This two-layer approach provides a total chamber depth of approximately 100 μm and creates dangling (deformable) pillars of height 75 μm (Fig. 1c,d). Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) devices were casted (Sylgard 184 Part A (base) and Part B (curing agent) 10:1 by weight; Dow Corning) over the SU-8 mold by curing for ~2 hours at 75°C. The PDMS replica was then treated in an air-plasma cleaner (Harrick Plasma, Ithaca, NY) for 1 minute and bonded to a 1×3\" glass slide. Bonding was done ensuring the pillars did not collapse or deform. Inlet and outlet holes were cored with a 1mm hole puncher (Accuderm) before bonding. Device preparation and worm loading into the device Bonded and cleaned microfluidic pillar arenas were prepared by surface treating with 5 wt% Pluronic F127 solution. Pluronic solution was loaded into the device through one of the inlets and incubated for 30 minutes, followed by washing with M9 buffer. The pluronic treatment minimizes protein/bacterial fouling and also helps to reduce bubble formation during worm loading33. Immediately before each strength experiment, plates were flooded with 3-4 mL of M9 solution (approximately 100 animals/mL). For individual worm loading, the worm solution from the M9-flooded culture plate was diluted to 10X (approximately 10 animals/mL). Single animals were loaded into the device by using a syringe connected to tubing. Individual loading can also be done by hand picking a single worm. Experiments involving the composite arena, levamisole drug treatment, and body size effects were carried out with individuals. Muscle strength of mutants was evaluated at a population level, in which case the identity of the worm is not preserved during imaging. For population studies, approximately 25-30 animals were gently injected into the NemaFlex using a 1 mL syringe. While retaining animals between pillar obstacles, residual bacteria were removed from the device by flow of M9 buffer. In both the individual and population experiments, animals were allowed to habituate in the arena for approximately 5 minutes before imaging in the food-free environment. The imaging was conducted on two sets of microscopes and camera combinations. Most of the initial trials and strength measurement of mutants were performed on an inverted microscope (IX71, Olympus, Center Valley, PA) with image acquisition from a CCD camera (ImageEM, Hamamatsu, Japan). The magnification used was 6.4X with an image resolution of 2.52 μm/pixel. Imaging for experiments dealing with arena design optimization, forced contraction assay with levamisole, and influence of body size on strength were carried out using another microscope (IX70, Olympus, Center Valley, PA) instrumented with a CCD camera (Retiga R6, QImaging, Canada). The magnification used was 6X with an image resolution of 0.7 μm/pixel. Images were acquired at 5 fps for a duration of 30-120 s of one single worm with a field of view of 1880×1540 μm2. All imaging was conducted at a temperature of 20 ± 1°C. Image processing for quantitation of pillar displacements Experimental error in the measurement of forces False positive force detections in the system were determined by tracking a single undeflected pillar from twenty movies of wild-type worms (age = 60 hrs). The error distribution has a mean at 0.9 μN, a standard deviation of 0.8 μN, and an f95value of 2.2 μN. Inset compares error distribution relative to the strength of the population. The f95value of the error distribution is less than 10% of the f95value for the worm population. There is also zero overlap between the two force distributions, allowing clear distinction between true forces and errors. Animal velocity and gait analysis To calculate the crawling speed ofC. elegans, the displacement of the midpoint of the body skeleton was tracked in time. For force-velocity correlation, instantaneous velocity from two consecutive frames was calculated, and the correlation was plotted using the maximal force in the later frame. For characterizing the mean crawling speed, the entire episode was used, and displacements of the midpoint were measured in time. Gait analysis included measuring the wavelength and amplitude of the undulatory forward motion by determining the distance between two peaks in the body wave and the peak height, respectively. Data from ten animals was measured and averaged. Muscle contraction (levamisole) assay 20-30 animals were loaded into the micropillar chambers housing individual worms. Since the loading process can take 15-20 min, bacteria suspension of 100 mgE. coliOP50/mL of S-complete was added to each chamber after worm loading so that the individuals did not suffer from food deprivation. Imaging of each animal before exposure to levamisole was carried out after removing food with S-complete and allowing the animal to habituate for 5 minutes in the food-free environment. The muscle contraction experiment was carried out with 1 mM levamisole solution in S-complete. The levamisole solution was added to the individual chambers using a 1 mL syringe after the first round of imaging. Muscle contraction induced by levamisole (worm body length contraction) was captured 30 seconds after addition of levamisole solution and continued for 3 minutes or until the worm was paralyzed. ImageJ 1.48v was used to measure the length of the worm before and after the levamisole exposure. Force characterization during long-time variation in behavior Individual wild-type young adult worms were loaded into the pillar chambers. The first set of images was captured 2 minutes after loading, which is denoted as t = 0 hr. Food (100 mgE. coliOP50/mL of S-complete) was added at the 1-hour mark to avoid food limitation. The food was then removed at the 2-hour time point, and then 2 minutes after food removal the worm was imaged to obtain strength data at t = 2 hr and 2.5 hr time points. All the data analysis was conducted in MATLAB (Mathworks, R2014b). Cumulative probability distributions were generated using Kernel Density Estimate (KDE). The bin size is estimated using the built-in asymptotic approximation. The force value at a cumulative probability of 95% (f95) is taken as the strength of the animal. A two-sample t-test was used to determine significance of data from muscle contraction assays. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test (WRST) was used to compare genetic mutants. Basic principle of NemaFlex and force analysis In general, we find that the magnitude of the pillar forces depends on the contact point along the nematode body, body configuration, and behavioral characteristics ofC. elegans. Given this probabilistic nature of pillar forces exerted by the worm, we sought to establish a robust and reproducible procedure for quantifying animal strength.Fig. 4a-dshows this procedure in which we typically record a 30 second behavioral episode per animal. In every image of the acquired video, we identify the pillar with the maximal deflection (labeled red inFig. 4aamong all the candidate pillars), allowing us to extract an instantaneous maximal force value from each frame (Fig. 4b). We bin all the instantaneous maximal force values and generate a cumulative force distribution curve that defines a probability for exerting a maximal force lower than or equal to a given value (Fig. 4c). From this distribution, we define the maximal force corresponding to 95% cumulative probability,f95, as the maximum exertable force (MEF) ofC. elegans(Fig. 4d). Our error in force detection, measured from pillars that are not in animal contact, is markedly lower than the maximal forces exerted by the nematode (Fig. 4b), with a cumulative measurement error of 2.5 μN in thef95value (c.f.Fig. 3). (a) Stack of images showing the worm interacting with different pillars during a locomotory episode. The deflected pillars are circled in blue, and the red circle denotes the pillar that experiences the maximum force. Scale bar, 200 μm. (b) Variation of maximal force over time due to a worm interacting with pillars (in red). The black curve shows force variation from the pillars that are not in contact with the worm – giving an estimate of error in our force measurement. (c) Cumulative probability distribution curves of maximal forces for different worms (age = 60 hrs) showing the variability between individuals (n = 14). The red trace represents the cumulative force distribution curve for the population. (d) From the cumulative force distribution curve, the maximum exertable force,f95, is defined as the maximal force at 95% cumulative probability. Our approach allows defining the MEF at the level of an individual or a population, depending on whether the data constitute maximal forces from a single worm or a collection of worms. The cumulative force distribution curve for individuals typically consists of 200 data points, and for a population at least 2000.Fig. 4cshows the cumulative force distribution curve for wild-type (WT, age = 60 hrs) individuals. We find variability in thef95values between individuals suggesting that some animals are naturally stronger than others, even though their body diameters are very similar (5% variation of mean body diameter). Resistance to locomotion in the pillar arena determines maximal forces Highly resistive pillar environment is characterized by low velocity and strong forces (a) A composite micropillar arena containing sections A1, A2, and A3 with different pillar spacings to investigate the influence of animal confinement on force generation. Scale bar, 5 mm. (b) The same nematode shown in the three different arenas. The level of confinement (D/s) increases as the worm crawls from arena A1 to A3. Scale bar, 100 μm. The force-velocity data for animals in (c) A1, (d) A2, and (e) A3 arenas. The lines indicate force-velocity cut-offs of 80 μN and 600 μm/s. The data correspond to 17 WT individuals of age 84 hours. Pooling data from individuals (WT, age = 84 hrs), inFig. 5c-ewe show the maximal pillar force (from each image) versus the instantaneous animal velocity in the three arenas. We observe that in the moderately confined A1 arena, animals move at velocities as large as 600 μm/s and rarely exert forces more than 80 μN (Fig. 5c). In contrast, animals in the strongly confining A3 arena move at much slower velocities and often exert forces > 80 μN (Fig. 5e). Such large forces occur less frequently in arena A2 (Fig. 5d). Scoring the forward crawling locomotion, we find that between A1 and A3 arenas, the body wavelength reduces by 12% and amplitude varies by 3%, suggesting that in the moderate-strong confinement regime the force-velocity correlation is much more strongly affected than the forward crawling gait. Frequent exertion of maximal forces in A3 arena can be understood from the high mechanical resistance to locomotion provided by this tight pillar arena where the nematode muscles push against the pillar, but its body cannot adjust its position in response to reaction forces due to the body being constrained simultaneously by multiple pillars. Evidence for the strong mechanical resistance is exemplified by the high frequency of turns and reversals in the highly resistive A3 and A2 arenas compared to A1 (Fig. 6). The frequency of reversals and turns is higher under tighter confinement due to strong mechanical resistance of the pillar environment. The data correspond to 17 WT individuals of age 84 hours. Identification of different regimes of resistance to locomotion In the non-resistive regime, the submerged nematode is typically in contact with one or two pillars (Fig. 7a). The forces would be low here because the nematode translates and rotates in response to a body contact with a pillar, exhibiting swimming-like behavior. An example of this regime was shown by Majmudaret al., where forD/s= 0.17, nematode swim trajectories were observed to be diverted by mechanical interactions with the pillars38. The nematode experiences increasing confinement (D/s) from left to right due to increasing density of pillars. (a) Weak resistance,D/s= 0.2, (b) moderate resistance,D/s= 0.6, and (c) strong resistance,D/s= 1.0. Large forces are expected under strong confinement due to enhanced mechanical resistance and constrained body shapes. The operating confinement regime of our NemaFlex system is highlighted. In the highly-resistive regime which corresponds to our arenas A2 and A3, frequent contacts with multiple pillars occur (Fig. 7c). Animal velocity is low and forces are high because of the incompatibility between nematode gait and pillar configuration. Our observations are in agreement with the work by Johariet al.and Khareet al., who used arenas withD/s= 0.86 -1.6 and showed that animals exert strong forces23,24. The existence of these regimes indicates that NemaFlex device needs to operate in the highly resistive regime to score MEF. However, even in this highly resistive regime, individual pillar forces fluctuate from low to high as evidenced by our cumulative force distribution curves, thus requiring robust measurement and data analysis protocols for standardized strength measurement. Previous works have been unable to establish behavior- and gait-independent measures of strength that are indicative of MVF inC. elegans. Maximum exertable forcef95is a reliable measure to score muscle strength inC. elegans In this section, we show that MEF, our proposed metric ofC. elegansstrength, yields consistent values in highly resistive pillar arenas and that it is independent of gait and behavior. By using a drug that contracts muscles we confirm that MEF due to induced muscle contractions is the same as that calculated from force distribution due to voluntary muscle action. Finally, we demonstrate that MEF can be used to reliably score neuromuscular weakness in mutants. Optimized pillar arena produces consistent readout of MEF A comparison between maximum exertable forcef95measured for WT individuals in (a) section A2 and section A3 (n = 14, slope = 1.01 ± 0.05, r2= 0.65) and (b) in section A1 and section A3 (n=13, slope = 0.46 ± 0.07, r2= -0.55). A similar comparison is shown forunc-112animals (n=13 individuals) in (c) A2 and A3 (n = 12, slope 0.99 ± 0.04, r2= 0.67) and (d) A1 and A3 (n= 10, slope = 0.81 ± 0.07, r2= -0.25). Comparison forlon-2animals (n=10 individuals) in (e) A2 and A3 (n=9, slope=0.98± 0.05, r2= 0.72) and (f) A1 and A3 (n= 8, slope = 0.75 ± 0.07, r2= 0.67). The red line is the best-fit curve to the data, and the dashed black line has a slope of unity and passes through origin. The blue lines demarcate the 95% confidence interval region. It is possible that the limits of validity of confinement that we have established here to obtain consistent MEF readout may vary, for example forC. elegansof different sizes or mutants. In such cases, the composite-arena approach with individuals that we have demonstrated here is a useful means to identify the optimal confinement range for maximum force exertion. MEF is independent of locomotory gait To address whether the locomotory gait impacts MEF in the NemaFlex device we isolated episodes from our videos where the animal (WT, age = 60 hrs) was making a forward crawl or omega turn or reversal (Fig. 9a-d). We note that the forward crawl involved either a long-wave or a short-wave body posture with the short-wave being less frequent (Fig. 9a,b). The cumulative probability force distributions corresponding to each of these locomotory modes is shown inFig. 9e. We find that the omega turns and reversals produce larger average force; however, the MEF estimates are very similar:f95(long wave) = 20.98 μN,f95(short wave) = 21.04 μN,f95(reversal) = 22.38 μN, andf95(omega) = 21.32 μN. Thus, the strength measure MEF provided by NemaFlex is not strongly dependent on animal gait. (a) Images showing the different gaits exhibited by crawling WTC. elegansin the pillar arena of the NemaFlex device. The arrows show direction of the animal motion. (b) The cumulative force distribution for the different gaits shown in (a). The horizontal dashed line indicates 95% probability, and the vertical bar highlights that thef95values for each gait are very similar. Animal age = 60 hrs andD/s= 0.87 – 0.98. MEF is insensitive to time-variation of behavior Next, we evaluated whether MEF is sensitive to time variation of behavior by recording behavioral episodes of individuals. In a 30-second behavioral episode we typically observed forward crawls, omega turns, and reversals (c.f.Fig. 6). We analyzed contiguous images of 30-second duration with a random starting point in the video. In complementary sampling, we scored non-repeating, discrete images randomly (totaling 30-second duration) from the full behavioral episode. Thef95of individuals calculated either from contiguous or random sampling of the behavior is shown inFig. 10a,b. We find that in both contiguous and discrete samplingf95typically varied by less than 10% of the mean value. This less than 10% variation is commensurate with the error in force measurement shown inFig. 3indicating therefore that MEF is insensitive to short-time variation in behavior. (a) MEF of WT individuals obtained from analyzing contiguous frames of 30-second duration with a randomly sampled starting point in the movie (movie length is 85 – 120 seconds). Data is shown as mean ± SD from N = 5 sampling trials. 17 individuals showed SD < 10%, while three showed SD between 10 - 16%. (b) MEF values obtained from non-repeating randomly sampled discrete frames. The movie sets are the same as in (a). Data is shown as mean ± SD from N = 5 trials. In this case all 20 individuals showed SD < 10%. (c) MEF of individuals evaluated at three time points: 0, 2, and 2.5 hours. Here a 2-minute episode was captured for each worm and a contiguous 30-second episode was analyzed to obtain MEF. Animal age = 60 hrs andD/s= 0.85 – 0.95. MEF before and after drug-induced muscle contractions is the same (a) A brief protocol for imaging and inducing muscle contraction on individual wild-typeC. eleganswith 1 mM levamisole. A 60-second episode is captured for each animal before levamisole treatment, and capturing continues for 60 to 200 seconds after the induction. (b) Levamisole treatment-induced muscle contraction causes the body length to decrease by 10.4 ± 3.2%. (age = 60 – 84 hrs, n=51, p < 0.0005). (c) Maximum strength of individual animals before and after the levamisole treatment for three different age groups – 60 hrs (n = 15), 76 hrs (n = 14) and 84 hrs (n = 20). The red line is a linear best fit of the pooled data: slope =1.09 +/− 0.06, intercept = -0.006, and r2=0.89. Dashed blue lines show the 95% level confidence interval (n =49). The dashed black line representsf95lev+=f95lev-(slope of 1 and intercept at origin). A two sample t-test confirms that NemaFlex is measuring the maximum muscular strength of the animal (p =0.24). For this data set, D/s = 0.95 - 1.02. (d) Comparison of population-level force distribution for wild type (n=20, N=3,475 data points) and threeC. elegansmuscular or neuromuscular mutantsunc-52(n=12, N=14,883 data points),unc-112(n=5, N=2,992 data points), andunc-17(n=20, N=6,997 data points). Wilcoxon rank-sum test confirms that NemaFlex is measuring neuromuscular weakness (p > 0.005). For this data set, D/s = 0.85 - 0.92. InFig. 11c, we show the force data for individual animals of three different ages (60, 76, and 84 hours) and find that thef95value after levamisole treatment shows an excellent linear correlation with thef95score of untreated crawling worms, i.e.f95lev+≅f95lev-(slope for 60 hrs = 0.89 ± 0.19, slope for 76 hrs = 0.85 ± 0.13, and slope for 84 hrs = 1.08 ± 0.16), supporting that MEF quantitates the maximum muscular strength ofC. elegans. It is remarkable that even though some animals are weak or strong to begin with due to differences in age or individual variability, thef95after drug exposure correlates well for both the weak and strong animals, highlighting the robustness of our strength measure. MEF detects muscle strength weakness in mutants Given that NemaFlex measures the maximum strength ofC. elegans, we tested its capability to detect strength changes due to genetic defects in body wall muscles and neuromuscular signaling. We measured strength in the muscle mutantsunc-112andunc-52, which have impaired production of the sarcomere proteins kindlin and perlecan respectively9,40,41. We also tested the mutantunc-17, which has decreased levels of acetylcholine, one of the major neurotransmitters responsible for muscle contractions39,42. In all three mutants, we found that force production decreased compared to wild-type animals (f95=11.92, 16.61, 22.74 μN, and 28.43 μN forunc-112, unc-52, unc-17, and wild-type respectively;Fig. 11d), confirming that the NemaFlex method can reveal neuromuscular weakness. Influence of body size on muscular strength inC. elegans Muscular strength depends strongly on body diameter but not length To address the influence of body size, we measured the mid-body diameter, length, and strength of at least 80 age-matched individuals of WT andlon-2mutants, which are longer than wild type (Fig. 12a-d). We find that even though the mean length oflon-2mutants is ≈1.3 times that of wild-type animals (Fig. 12a, b), the muscular strength of these two populations is not statistically different (Fig. 12c), suggesting that the worm body length does not significantly influence the muscle strength recorded by NemaFlex. In striking contrast, we observe a strong increase of muscle strength with the worm body diameter (Fig. 12d). The data fit to the scaling relationshipf95~ Dm, withm= 3.32 ± 0.48 and 3.04 ± 0.30 for WT andlon-2animals respectively. (a) Influence of the body length was evaluated by comparing the force production of wild type (top image) and alon-2mutant (bottom image). Scale bar, 200 μm. (b) Distribution of the body lengths of wild type (n = 89) andlon-2(n = 37) at a single time point (48 hours) for similar diameter worms. Thelon-2worms are ≈ 1.3 times longer than wild type. (c) The strength distributions of wild-type andlon-2worms are statistically similar. Animal populations are the same as in (b). (d) Both wild type (n = 94) andlon-2(n = 84) show approximately a cubic dependency of strength on body diameter. MEF data for each population was binned using bin widths of 2.5 μm. Data shown is mean ± SD. (e) Active bending of worm body curvature produces pillar forces. The vector sum of the pillar forces (red arrows) is zero in (i). The nematode pushes pillars when trying to (ii) increase or (iii) decrease its curvature. Increase of the curvature is induced by tension from contracting muscles (red in (ii), green shows relaxing muscle). Similarly, decrease of the curvature is initiated by transferring the tension to the other pair of muscles (red in (iii)) by initiating contraction in the relaxed muscle section. Scale bar, 200 μm. (f) Bending moment analysis in the human muscle arm that is lifting a weight. See main text for description of the symbols. (g) A schematic of the worm body segment under active bending where muscles are shown as (i) springs resembling the contraction and relaxation of muscles.Tis the muscle tension in the worm,Dis the body diameter,Fis the pillar force andsis the pillar spacing. (ii) Animals with larger diameters have more muscle cross-sectional area and therefore produce more force. To understand the relationship between worm body diameter and muscular strength, we consider active bending of the worm body that produces pillar forces whose vector sum is nearly zero (Fig. 12e, i). These pillar forces are produced byC. elegansdue to changes in body curvature induced by contraction or relaxation of its muscles. For the example shown inFig. 12e, the curvature increase is induced by tension in the dorsal contracting muscle (Fig. 12e, ii), and it is decreased during dorsal relaxation (Fig. 12e, iii). The reason why thick animals exert higher forces is analogous to why thick elastic rods require more force to bend than thin rods. This qualitative argument may explain the influence of body diameter onC. elegans’ maximal muscle strength measures. A biomechanics model explainsD3scaling To develop a simple model that incorporates the effect of body diameter, we consider the bending moment (M) induced in the muscles of a human arm that is lifting a weight (F),i.e.M = F×L, where L is the lever arm (Fig. 12f). Applying this analogy to the bending moment introduced in the worm muscles while pushing against pillars, we get M = F×L ~ T×D, where T is the muscle tension in the worm body (Fig. 12g). Assuming the muscle tension is proportional to the cross-sectional area of the muscle (Am) and the lever arm is equivalent to pillar spacing, we haveF ~ Am×D/s. Since Amis proportional to the worm body cross-section, i.e.Am~ D2, we finally have Eqn. (2)suggests thatf95should scale as the cube of worm body diameter and is inversely proportional to the pillar spacing. Assessment of scaling of strength with body diameter in wild-type and mutant animals. Our data set shows thatf95~D3and it is possible that deviations from theD3scaling may occur in some mutants or older animals. In such cases deviations fromD3scaling can be potentially corrected by knowing the detailed anatomy of the muscle cross-sectional area. If deviations still exist then it might indicate intrinsic differences in the tension of the muscle fibers in the nematode. Investigation of such differences resulting from genetic defects or age is one of the main motivations for the development of the NemaFlex system. C. elegansis a powerful genetic model with conserved muscle biology, and over the last few decades new insights have been gained into the assembly, maintenance, and regulation of striated muscle that are usually applicable to all animals. Kinematic measures, for example swim frequency or crawling speed, derived from locomotory assays have been typically used to assess neuromuscular function inC. elegans44. More recently, propulsive forces have been determined by tracking velocity fields and body kinematics during swimming45by challenging worms to swim up inclined surfaces46and by measuring drag coefficients of crawling animals47. In a parallel effort, building on advances in microfluidics48, important attempts for measuring forces generated by movingC. eleganshave been made using piezoresistance sensors20and deformable pillars22–26. However, these prior efforts reported forces that vary depending on pillar arena geometry, worm velocity, and body posture;thus, none of these yields a maximum force that is independent of animal behavior and accounts for variations in animal size. Without a behavior- and size-independent strength measurement, it is difficult to standardize muscle force investigations inC. elegans. Here we have optimized the micropillar forest design, defined the measurement conditions, and fine-tuned the workflow analysis so that NemaFlex can reliably score the maximum exertable force inC. elegans. To confirm that NemaFlex indeed reports behavior-independent strength, we evaluated different pillar spacings and duration of behavioral episodes and showed that animals push as hard as they can once they reach a certain level of confinement; a behavioral episode as low as 30 seconds is sufficient to capture a statistically invariant MEF for young adults. The force measures before and after levamisole-induced full muscle contractions were found to be similar, which supports our metric of maximum force. Indeed, the levamisole experiment shows thatC. elegansMEF is similar to human MVF - a critical advance for the ability to compare experimental data across muscle studies. Recognizing that animals from the same culture might have different body sizes or that mutations may cause variation in body size, we investigated the influence of body size on MEF. We showed that MEF is independent of the body length, but it strongly depends on body diameter. Importantly, we uncovered a relationship of strength withC. elegansdiameter that is consistent with a scaling analysis in which bending moments due to maximum external force and internal muscle tension balance each other. Thus, we have produced a compensation factor for body size that enables animals of different age, genetic makeup, or experience to be fairly compared. In humans, relative strength is a compelling indicator of muscle homeostasis, physical training, and disease. As we model these conditions in invertebrates, there is a critical need to establish standardized measures of strength that have relevance in human muscle physiology. The NemaFlex technology addresses this gap by providing a robust analog of MVF in vertebrates. With current throughput of strength evaluation being ~10 min/worm (loading, imaging, image analysis, and validation), the NemaFlex system is well equipped for targeted investigations on disease conditions that can be modeled inC. elegans. High throughput genetic and drug screens are also possible with NemaFlex, although this would require further microfluidic automation and parallelized analysis. At a more fundamental level, NemaFlex may help in defining molecular and cellular circuits of neuromuscular function49.
