Auxin is transported in plants with distinct polarity, defined by transport proteins of the PIN-formed (PIN) family. Components of the complex trafficking machinery responsible for polar PIN protein localization have been identified by genetic approaches, but severe developmental phenotypes of trafficking mutants complicate dissection of this pathway. We utilized a temperature sensitive allele ofArabidopsis thaliana SCD1(stomatal cytokinesis defective1) that encodes a RAB-guanine nucleotide exchange factor. Auxin transport, lateral root initiation, asymmetric auxin-induced gene expression after gravitropic reorientation, and differential gravitropic growth were reduced in the roots of thescd1-1mutant relative to wild type at the restrictive temperature of 25°C, but not at the permissive temperature of 18°C. Inscd1-1at 25°C, PIN1- and PIN2-GFP accumulated in endomembrane bodies. Transition of seedlings from 18 to 25°C for as little as 20 min resulted in the accumulation of PIN2-GFP in endomembranes, while gravitropism and root developmental defects were not detected until hours after transition to the non-permissive temperature. The endomembrane compartments that accumulated PIN2-GFP inscd1-1exhibited FM4-64 signal colocalized with ARA7 and ARA6 fluorescent marker proteins, consistent with PIN2 accumulation in the late or multivesicular endosome. These experiments illustrate the power of using a temperature sensitive mutation in the gene encoding SCD1 to study the trafficking of PIN2 between the endosome and the plasma membrane. Using the conditional feature of this mutation, we show that altered trafficking of PIN2 precedes altered auxin transport and defects in gravitropism and lateral root development in this mutant upon transition to the restrictive temperature. The process of auxin transport drives many aspects of plant development, including primary root elongation, lateral root development, and asymmetric growth in response to gravity and light gradients (Muday and DeLong, 2001;Vieten et al., 2007;Zazimalova et al., 2010). Auxin (indole-3-acetic acid; IAA) is transported long distances in two polarities in two root cell layers (Muday and DeLong, 2001). Cell to cell IAA transport is mediated by AUX/LAX influx carriers and by efflux carriers of the PIN and ABCB families (Zazimalova et al., 2010). Directionality is controlled by asymmetric localization of PIN proteins at the plasma membrane (Wisniewska et al., 2006;Adamowski and Friml, 2015). InArabidopsisroots, PIN1 is localized to the stele and implicated in auxin transport toward the root apex (Galweiler et al., 1998), which is now called rootward transport and this auxin flow is required for lateral root development (Reed et al., 1998;Lavenus et al., 2013). In contrast, PIN2 is localized to the epidermal and cortical cell layers of roots and mediates shootward transport from the root apex (Muller et al., 1998), which is integral to root elongation and gravitropism (Rashotte et al., 2000). PIN3 is localized to the columella cells at the root tip, where the angle of the gravity vector is perceived, and in the vascular cylinder, consistent with functions in gravitropism and root development, respectively (Friml et al., 2002;Harrison and Masson, 2007). The polar distribution of the PIN proteins is dynamic (Barbosa and Schwechheimer, 2014;Weller et al., 2017). Targeting of PIN proteins to the membrane in response to stimuli may be an important mechanism to allow changes in auxin transport and dependent growth processes (Paciorek et al., 2005;Barbosa and Schwechheimer, 2014). PIN proteins travel through the endosome to the plasma membrane afterde novosynthesis through a highly regulated process (Jasik et al., 2013,2016) involving the RAB and ARF families of small G proteins. GNOM, a well-studied ARF-GEF and target of the drug Brefeldin A, is critical in targeting of PIN1 and PIN2 between the endosome and the plasma membrane (Geldner et al., 2001,2004,2003). Although genetic approaches have identified pathways for targeting PIN proteins (Adamowski and Friml, 2015), non-conditional mutants with impaired auxin transport, such asgnom, have profound developmental phenotypes (Geldner et al., 2003). This complicates determination of whether altered auxin transport causes developmental phenotypes or the converse. This study used a conditionalscd1-1mutant to test whether auxin transport trafficking defects precede growth or developmental phenotypes. The SCD1 protein has a DENN domain, found exclusively in RAB-GEFs (Yoshimura et al., 2010;Marat et al., 2011). SCD1 and an associated protein, SCD2, have been shown to complex with a RabE1 at the exocyst inArabidopsisroots (Mayers et al., 2017), where it plays a role in exocytosis and recycling of membrane proteins. Threescd1mutant alleles have been described:scd1-1,scd1-2, andscd1-3(Falbel et al., 2003).scd1-2andscd1-3are loss of function mutants with altered guard cell development, and profound root growth and developmental phenotypes. However, the temperature sensitivescd1-1allele, displays these phenotypes only at the restrictive temperature of 25°C (Falbel et al., 2003). Root Elongation and Lateral Root Development Are Temperature-Sensitive inscd1-1 Root growth and lateral root formation inscd1-1are reduced at the restrictive temperature.(A)Col(g) andscd1-1roots 12 days after sowing grown under continuous light at 18°C or 25°C.(B,C)Primary root length(B)and lateral root number(C)were measured daily for Col(g) andscd1-1seedlings maintained at 25 or 18°C.

Rootward3H-IAA transport was measured in a pulse chase assay using seedlings grown for 9 and 10 days for Col(g) andscd1-1, respectively, to match seedling length. Transported auxin was quantified in progressive 2 mm segments downstream of the site of application.

Auxin-induced gene expression was reflected in the movement of fluorescence from the root tip toward the shoot in the epidermal tissue at the indicated times after application of IAA at the root tip at(G)18°C and (H) 25°C. Arrowheads indicate the most distal position of epidermal GFP signal. Scale bar = 50 μm. Gravity-Directed Asymmetric pDR5-GFP Expression Is Altered inscd1-1 scd1-1shows decreased lateral distribution of auxin at 25°C as compared to wild type. Col(g) andscd1-1pDR5-GFP-expressing seedlings were grown vertically for 5 days at 18 or 25°C. After 90° rotation, the asymmetrical pDR5-GFP expression was observed at the root tip at 4, 6, and 8 h after reorientation. The arrows indicate the position farthest from the root tip where asymmetric GFP fluorescence was detected. The seedlings were stained with propidium iodide (magenta) to delineate the cell walls. Representative images from more than 5 roots of each genotype and time point are shown.

PIN1, but not PIN3, ABCB19, or AUX1, was found in endomembrane bodies inscd1-1mutants. Col(g) andscd1-1seedlings expressing PIN1-GFP, PIN3-GFP, ABCB19-GFP (green), and AUX1-YFP (yellow) were grown for 7 days and imaged by LSCM using identical confocal settings after growth at the non-permissive temperature of 25°C. Propidium iodide was used to stain the cell wall (magenta). Representative images from at least 5 roots are shown.

Colocalization is indicated in the overlay as white. The merged image was enhanced using a pseudocolor fill of a thresholded image (last panel). Scale bar = 10 μm.(B)Roots were stained in FM4-64 for 20 min, transferred to water, and imaged immediately (20 min) or at later times as indicated.

The PIN2-GFP (green) and FM4-64 (magenta) channels are shown separately and in the overlay, where the overlap of both signals is shown in white. Scale bar is 10 μm. scd1-1PIN2-GFP Endomembrane Bodies Co-localize With ARA7 and ARA6 PIN2 overlays ARA7 and ARA6 in endomembrane bodies found in the root tips ofscd1-1mutants at 25°C. RFP-ARA7 or ARA6-RFP (magenta) were crossed intoscd1-1containing PIN2-GFP (green) roots and fluorescence visualized by confocal microscopy in 7 day old seedlings. Pixels with both green and magenta fluorescence are shown in white. Whenscd1-1seedlings expressing PIN2-GFP and RFP-ARA7 were grown at 25°C, endomembrane bodies were observed that have only PIN2-GFP signal (green) or RFP-ARA7 (magenta) signal, while a subset contain both signals (white). The insets are higher magnifications of the areas delineated by the white boxes above. For each reporter line, more than 20 seedlings were examined. The scale bar is 10 μm. PIN2 co-localizes with ARA7 and ARA6 in endomembrane bodiesscd1-1mutants at 25°C. Roots ofscd1-1containing ARA7-RFP or ARA6-RFP (magenta) and PIN2-GFP (green) roots were visualized by confocal microscopy in 7 day old seedlings. The overlay shows pixels with both green and magenta fluorescence as white. Using colocalization software, thresholds were generated to better illustrate pixels with both fluorescent signals from 4 roots of each line. Colocalization graphs are shown for endomembrane bodies that are circled. Polar transport of the hormone auxin from cell to cell is controlled by the asymmetric localization of the PIN family of IAA efflux carriers (Grunewald and Friml, 2010;Zazimalova et al., 2010;Adamowski and Friml, 2015). These carrier proteins are directed to specific plasma membrane domains through dynamically regulated membrane trafficking and recycling pathways (Geldner, 2009;Grunewald and Friml, 2010;Barbosa and Schwechheimer, 2014). Internal and external environmental cues also affect the localization of the PIN proteins through regulation of the flow of PIN proteins between the endosome and plasma membrane (Paciorek et al., 2005;Jasik et al., 2013,2016;Rakusova et al., 2015), as well as between the plasma membrane and the lytic vacuole (Kleine-Vehn et al., 2008a). In this study we utilized a temperature-sensitivescd1-1mutant to uncover the dynamics of auxin transport targeting and how these reversible changes in protein targeting control auxin transport and dependent process. SCD1 contains a DENN domain found in proteins with RAB-directed GEF activity and in proteins that interact with clathrin (Patino-Lopez et al., 2008;Sato et al., 2008;McMichael et al., 2013).SCD1null mutants have revealed the function of this protein as a RAB-GEF that participates in both endocytosis and exocytosis (Mayers et al., 2017). The effects of the temperature-sensitivescd1-1mutant on root development was examined at the permissive and restrictive temperatures of 18 and 25°C, respectively. We found thatscd1-1exhibits a suite of phenotypes only at restrictive temperature, which include impaired root elongation and gravity response, reduced lateral root formation, and inhibition of formation of asymmetric auxin-induced gene expression across a gravity-stimulated root. These phenotypes were also induced when plants were grown at the permissive temperature and then transitioned to the restrictive temperature and could be reversed when plants were transitioned from the restrictive temperature back to the permissive temperature. As all of these phenotypes are dependent on auxin transport, we also measured both shootward and rootward transport and found that both are impaired at the restrictive temperature. The ability to reversibly manipulate lateral root development in thescd1-1mutant provided unique insight into how this process is regulated and revealed the critical time point when SCD1 and auxin transport are needed for lateral root development. A temperature-switch assay was performed resulting in the shift of seedlings from the permissive temperature to the non-permissive temperature or vice versa over 10 days. These data support the hypothesis that SCD1 is needed for lateral root development between days 2 and 6. Transition from the permissive to non-permissive temperature also reduces auxin transport inscd1-1(but not Col(g)) showing reductions in the long distance rootward transport within 8 h after transition. A previous report suggested that there is specific regulation of auxin transport in this time window with a pulse of auxin moving from the shoot to the root at 3–5 days, which correlated with the emergence of the first lateral root (Bhalerao et al., 2002). Our ability to reversibly alter auxin transport by turning off or on SCD1 function support the model of an auxin pulse that drives root formation that occurs within a precise developmental window. The effects of thescd1-1mutation on auxin transport and gravitropism were evident after both long and short-term exposure to the non-permissive temperature, with changes in auxin transport evident preceding gravitropic differences. When grown continuously at 25°C or within 8 h after transfer from the permissive 18°C temperature,scd1-1seedlings showed reduced shootward3H-IAA transport and accumulation of auxin-induced gene expression at the root tip, consistent with impaired auxin transport away from the site of application. Similarly, continuous growth at 25°C or a shift from 18 to 25°C for 8 h showed a significant decrease in the gravitropic curvature inscd1-1compared to wild type. Auxin-induced gene expression, visualized via DR5-GFP fluorescence (Muday and Rahman, 2008;Geisler et al., 2014) was rapidly enhanced on the lower side of Col(g) roots after gravitropic reorientation, but was impaired inscd1-1seedlings relative to wild type only in plants grown at 25°C. These data support the hypothesis that a functional SCD1 protein is needed to maintain polar and lateral auxin transport and the physiological processes dependent upon dynamic changes in appropriate auxin distribution. Consistent with this model, altered PIN2-GFP trafficking is even more rapidly perturbed inscd1-1than auxin movements and gravity response. Because PIN2 is required for rootward transport and root gravitropism (Muller et al., 1998;Rashotte et al., 2000;Chen et al., 2002), we compared its localization in thescd1-1mutant and wild type using a PIN2-GFP reporter. At 25°C, PIN2 is normally localized to the plasma membrane on the shootward end of cells of the lateral root cap and epidermis of the developing root of wild type seedlings (Muller et al., 1998). In thescd1-1mutant, PIN2-GFP was not restricted to the plasma membrane but was also localized in endomembrane bodies.Mayers et al. (2017)showed thatscd1-2has altered PIN2-GFP trafficking during treatment with brefeldin A, a drug which blocks intracellular endosome and trans-Golgi transport. However, we find that inscd1-1at the restrictive temperature, PIN2-GFP accumulates in the absence of BFA. To confirm that the endomembranes in which PIN2-GFP accumulates inscd1-1are late endosomes, we crossed multiple endosomal markers into this mutant and performed colocalization analyses. Inscd1-1at 25°C, but not 18°C, we observed PIN2-GFP colocalization with ARA7 and to a lesser extent with ARA6. ARA6 and ARA7 are RAB5 GTPases contained in late multivesicular endosomes, with related, but not identical trafficking activities (Ueda et al., 2004;Beck et al., 2012;Ebine et al., 2012;Paez Valencia et al., 2016). ARA7 function is required for vesicle transport between the pre-vacuolar compartment (PVC) and the vacuole (Lee et al., 2004;Haas et al., 2007;Jia et al., 2013) and ARA6 is associated with transport between the PVC and the plasma membrane, where it may regulate trafficking from the endosome to the plasma membrane (Ebine et al., 2011,2012). PIN2 has also been localized to ARA7 vesicles inArabidopsisroots after treatment with endosidin 16, which inhibits apical membrane trafficking (Li et al., 2017). The colocalization of PIN2 with both ARA7 and ARA6 Rab-related GTPases is not surprising considering that compartments bearing ARA7 and ARA6 have been previously shown to partially overlap, despite evidence that they are distinct endosomal compartments (Ueda et al., 2004;Beck et al., 2012;Ebine et al., 2012). The PVC, where both ARA6 and ARA7 are found, is a distinct organelle in plants that facilitates the transport of materials from the endosomes to the vacuole (Contento and Bassham, 2012). Using immunogold and confocal microscopy, plasma membrane proteins that pass through the PVC have been shown to be directed to the vacuole for degradation (Haas et al., 2007;Viotti et al., 2010). Thus, association of PIN2 with the PVC inscd1-1suggests that PIN2 in the PVC is likely targeted to the vacuole for degradation. This could explain the reduced domain of PIN2-GFP staining seen in the mutants at the restrictive temperature, coincident with the changes in columella cells. However, there is also evidence that suggests that PIN2 can be retrieved from the PVC and recycled (Kleine-Vehn et al., 2008b;Spitzer et al., 2009). Indeed, PIN1, PIN2, and AUX1 are targeted to the vacuole through the multi-vesicular body (MVB), and RabF2A co-localizes in the MVB with PIN1-GFP (Spitzer et al., 2009). The localization of PIN2-GFP in late endosomal compartments inscd1-1is consistent with reports that PIN protein turnover involves both cycling between the endosome and plasma membrane and vacuolar degradation, depending on environmental conditions (Paciorek et al., 2005;Kleine-Vehn et al., 2008b;Grunewald and Friml, 2010;Jasik et al., 2013). For example, when roots are reoriented relative to the gravity vector, enhanced endocytosis of PIN2 at the apical membrane followed by degradation through sorting to a proteolytic endosomal compartment resulted in asymmetric distribution of PIN2, redirected auxin flow, and root bending (Abas et al., 2006). The mis-localization and loss of membrane PIN2 inscd1-1explains the observed reductions in auxin transport and the observed phenotypes. The efficient targeting of auxin transport proteins to the plasma membrane is required for appropriate auxin transport and dependent physiological processes. In this paper we have shown that the conditionalscd1-1mutant, with a defect in a gene that functions as a RAB-GEF (Mayers et al., 2017), has altered localization of PIN2, with accumulation of this protein in endomembrane bodies. The PIN2-GFP containing endomembrane bodies inscd1-1showed dye accumulation and fluorescent protein reporter expression consistent with a late endosomal/prevacuolar character. Consistent with this altered protein localization, polar auxin transport and gravity response are impaired inscd1-1. The kinetics of the alterations in these responses upon transition to the non-permissive temperature demonstrate that altered trafficking of PIN2 is observed within minutes of transition to this temperature, while auxin transport and gravity defects are measured hours later, and root developmental defects can be quantified days after transition. These findings provide direct evidence that disruption of the targeting machinery which disrupts PIN2 protein localization precedes reductions in auxin transport and changes in auxin transport-dependent physiological processes. Growth of Mutant and Transgenic Seedlings Seeds were sterilized (75% ethanol, 0.01% Triton X-100) for 2 min, followed by a 95% ethanol rinse. The culture medium was 0.8% (w/v) agar (MP Biomedical), 1X MS nutrients (macro and micro salts: MSP01-50LT, Caisson Labs, Inc.), vitamins (1 μg/mL–1thiamine, 1 μg/mL–1pyridoxine HCL, and 0.5 μg/mL–1nicotinic acid), 1.5% sucrose (w/v), and 0.05% MES (w/v); pH adjusted to 6.0 with 1M KOH. The seeds were placed in the dark at 4°C for 48 h before being moved to the permissive (18°C) or the restrictive (25°C) temperatures. The seedlings were grown vertically under continuous light at an intensity of 100 μmol m–2s–1for 5 or 7 days at the specified temperature. Characterization ofscd1-1Root Length and Lateral Root Development Seedlings of similar size were placed on fresh agar plates on the 5th day after growth at 18 or 25°C. Lateral roots initiation events corresponding to stages VI and VII of primordia (Malamy and Benfey, 1997) and emerged lateral roots (defined as any root that broke through the epidermis of the primary root) were quantified using a dissecting microscope. To examine lateral root formation in seedlings that were moved between temperature conditions, Col(g) andscd1-1seedlings were grown at 18 or 25°C continuously or transferred from 18 to 25°C at 2, 4, or 6 days. Parallel experiments were performed where seedlings were grown at 25°C continuously or transferred from 25 to 18°C at the indicated times. The number of lateral root initiation events and the number of emerged lateral roots were quantified by DIC microscopy using the Zeiss AxioObserver inverted microscope with a Plan Apochromatic 40x objective and the reported data is from 20 seedlings. Pulse-chase rootward (acropetal) IAA transport assays were performed using a previously published method (Lewis and Muday, 2009) in Col(g) seedlings at 9 and 6 days at 18 and 25° C, respectively.scd1-1seedlings were assayed at 10 days for both 18°C and 25°C to more closely match the length ofscd1-1and Col(g). An agar droplet (1.25% agar w/v) containing 1 μM tritiated IAA was placed at the root shoot junction and incubated at 18 or 25°C for 10 min. The seedlings were transferred to a new agar plate and exposed to a “chase” droplet of unlabeled 1 μM IAA. After 50 min, 2 mm sections were excised beginning at the base of the droplet toward the root tip. Three to six segments were recovered from all plants, and each segment was counted separately, and IAA levels quantitated using a Beckman LS6500 liquid scintillation counter. The average and SE of 19–25 seedlings is reported in all transport assays. Shootward IAA transport was measured by applying 500 nM tritiated IAA (3H-IAA) to root tips (Lewis and Muday, 2009) of 5 day seedlings grown at 18 or 25°C. For temperature switch experiments, seedlings were transferred to the appropriate temperature 4, 8, and 24 h before assay. Agar droplets containing 500 nM3H-IAA were applied to the root tips, and seedlings were placed into the indicated temperatures under yellow filters to prevent auxin degradation (Stasinopoulos and Hangarter, 1990). After 2 h, the droplets were removed from the root tip. A 5 mm segment was excised 2 mm from the site of3H-IAA application, and radioactivity was measured. Shootward IAA transport was also measured indirectly using the artificial DR5 promoter driving expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) (Ottenschläger et al., 2003). Droplets containing 1 μM unlabeled IAA in 1.25% agar were applied to the root tips of 5-day old seedlings grown at 18 or 25°C for the designated times. GFP fluorescence was visualized using a Zeiss 710 LSCM (Jena, Germany) using the argon laser with excitation at 488 nm. Images of root tips were captured using 80% laser power with 40x magnification, a pinhole of 2.64 airy units (AU), 560 gain and an emission spectrum of 493-656 nm. Images were exported to Adobe Photoshop, and the distance of GFP fluorescence in the epidermal layers was measured using the line tool. Five-day old Col(g) andscd1-1seedlings grown at 18°C were placed in diffuse light at 20–22 μmol m–2s–1and re-oriented 90°. Images were captured for low temporal resolution analysis at time 0 and at 2 h intervals until 8 h after re-orientation, with a final image 24 h after re-orientation. Images were captured using an Epson Perfection 3200 Photo Perfection flatbed scanner (Nagano, Japan) with 16-bit grayscale and 800 dpi resolution. Images were exported to ImageJ to measure degree of curvature. The gravitropic root response was also observed using high temporal resolution imaging using an AVT Marlin camera (Stadtroda, Germany). Root curvature after gravity stimulation was measured by a MATLAB based custom image analysis software (Lewis et al., 2007) and is the average and standard error of 12 seedlings of each genotype. Asymmetric Auxin Induced Gene Expression After Gravitropic Reorientation Col(g) andscd1-1seedlings crossed with the proDR5-GFP construct were imaged after roots were reoriented 90° relative to the gravity vector. Seedlings were placed on agar plates on the 5th day after growth at 18 or 25°C. After 1 h, seedlings were placed in diffuse light at 20–22 μmol m–2s–1and reoriented 90°. Images were captured at time 0 and at 2 h intervals until 8 h after re-orientation. Seedlings were stained with propidium iodide (PI) to visualize root structure and mounted in dH20 on slides. The root tips were visualized with the 40x objective of a Zeiss 710 LSCM using the argon laser at an excitation wavelength of 488nm and a pinhole of 1.0 AU. GFP emission was collected between 492 and 547 nm, while PI was collected at 567–735. All images were collected at identical gain and laser power and exported to Adobe Photoshop for analysis. Representative images of more than 5 roots at each time point and from each genotype were shown. Localization of Auxin Transport Protein-Fluorescent Protein Fusions Col(g) andscd1-1seedlings containing PIN2-GFP, PIN1-GFP, PIN3-GFP, ABCB19-GFP, and AUX1-YFP (protein fusions driven by endogenous promoters) were grown for 7 days at a constant 18 or 25°C. Seedlings were mounted in dH2O and maintained at the indicated temperatures using a Julabo F25 temperature stage (Seelbach, Germany). Images were captured using a 63x water objective with or without a 1.5x optical zoom on a Zeiss 710 LSCM, using the argon laser for excitation at 488 nm with a pinhole of 1.0AU. PIN2-GFP, PIN1-GFP, PIN3-GFP, and MDR1-GFP were imaged with an emission spectrum of 500–525 nm, while AUX1-YFP was imaged with an emission spectrum of 519–621 nm. For temperature shift experiments, wild-type andscd1-1were grown at 18°C for 7 days. Seedlings were transferred to microscope slides and then placed on the temperature-controlled stage at 25°C. Samples were imaged as described above at various times after transfer. For each reporter construct more than 5 roots were analyzed at each treatment, with representative images shown. Seedlings grown at 25°C were incubated in 5 μM FM4-64 to visualize endosomes (Bolte et al., 2004) for either 5 or 20 min, as indicated. The roots were rinsed in dH2O and imaged at various times after staining. The GFP and FM4-64 signals were visualized using a multi-track setting, as described above. No FM4-64 fluorescence was detected in the GFP channel. The FM4-64 signal was imaged using 80% laser power, a pinhole of 1.0 AU, 510 gain, and an emission spectrum of 632–759 nm. No GFP signal was detected in the FM4-64 channel. Individual images for each fluorophore and an overlay are shown with magenta for FM4-64, green for PIN2-GFP, and white for any pixels with both FM4-64 and PIN2. The red signal in these images was converted to magenta in Photoshop, changing the hue saturation. To better identify spatial colocalization independent of intensity, a thresholding function was applied to individual channels in Photoshop or in the Zeiss Zen colocalization module. We then prepared a thresholded overlay in which pixels are indicated as magenta for FM4-64, green for PIN2-GFP, and white for any pixels with both FM4-64 and GFP. To examine the change in colocalization of PIN2-GFP and FM4-64 over time, the number of PIN2-GFP, FM4-64, or both, signals in each cell with a PIN2-GFP labeled endomembrane compartment was quantified, and the percentage was determined for 740 cells from 20 roots. In the temperature shift experiments,scd1-1seedlings grown at 18°C for 7 days were transferred to 5 mM FM4-64 for 5 min, rinsed briefly, and then imaged at intervals of 2 min on a temperature-controlled stage at 25°C. Colocalization of PIN2 and Endosomal Markers Lines containing both PIN2-GFP and other RFP reporters were examined in dual channel mode as described above. PIN2-GFP SYP61-CFP transgenics were imaged using spectral imaging and linear unmixing at an excitation wavelength of 458 nm and a 464–648 nm filter.

Root elongation rate is reduced after transition to the restrictive temperature. Seedlings of Col(g) andscd1-1were grown at the permissive temperature of 18°C and then transferred to the restrictive temperature of 25°C. Root growth was measured in real time and is plotted as a function of time after transfer and is the average 12 seedlings with average and standard error reported. scd1-1has no apparent reduction in statolith abundance at either the permissive or restrictive temperature. Col(g) andscd1-1seedlings were grown for 5 days at 18 or 25°C, or were grown at 18°C and transferred from 18 to 25°C for 24 h before imaging. Representative images are shown from analysis of at least 5 seedlings. Scale bar = 20 mm. Inscd1-1grown at 25°C, PIN2-GFP and FM4-64 show limited colocalization in vesicles after a short incubation with FM4-64. PIN2-GFP (green) roots were incubated in FM4-64 (magenta) for 20 min, rinsed, and imaged immediately, where pixels of both signals are shown in white. Images were enhanced using a pseudocolor fill of a thresholded image (last panel). The figure shown is representative of the 17 roots analyzed. PIN2-GFP and FM4-64 do not colocalize in wild-type roots. Treatment of PIN2-GFP transgenic wild-type seedlings grown at 25°C with FM4-64 for 30 min resulted in endosomes stained with FM4-64, but not PIN2-GFP. PIN2-GFP does not colocalize with other endomembrane markers. The localization of a prevacuolar marker (SNX1-RFP,n> 50), a trans-Golgi marker (VHA1-RFP,n> 20), and a trans-Golgi/endosome marker (SYP61-CFP,n> 50) had limited overlap with PIN2-GFP fluorescent endomembrane bodies.
