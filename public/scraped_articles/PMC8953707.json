Spaceflight experiments using mice are being conducted to determine the impact of microgravity on different muscle groups [1]. A major health problem in spaceflight is muscle wastage due to microgravity. The primary muscles in the human body are the muscles of the upper limb and lower limb. Experiments on hind limb muscle wasting after a 13-day shuttle flight have shown reduced knee weight bearing and meniscal degradation, inducing an arthritic phenotype in cartilage and menisci [2]. Changes in electrical impedance characteristics in gastrocnemius muscles are also induced by spaceflight [3]. Skeletal muscle atrophy is a secondary effect of aging (sarcopenia) and diseases such as diabetes, cancer and kidney diseases. The primary muscles in the human body are the upper limb and lower limb. Studies have shown that muscle gene expression is different in spaceflight vs. that on the ground. Models of sarcopenia and age-related muscle loss have been studied in [4]. Spaceflight induces similar muscle loss, and the analysis of their gene expression (see [5]) has revealed that a majority of 272 mRNAs that were significantly altered by spaceflight displayed similar responses to hind limb suspension. There are several molecular processes that influence muscle atrophy. The muscle RING-finger protein-1 that plays an important role in muscle remodeling is an E3 ubiquitin ligase expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle tissues [6]. Spaceflight induces unique muscle atrophy in animal models. The MuRF1 nullified mice did not show improvement in soleus muscle loss, showing that atrophy proceeds under unique mechanisms in spaceflight [7]. Muscle mass is a balance between protein generation and degradation. A decreased rate of synthesis causes skeletal muscle wasting. The ubiquitin proteosome is the protein synthesis pathway in muscle atrophy. It has been shown that proteosome inhibition reduces denervation-induced muscle atrophy [8]. One of the most important muscle-wasting cytokines is tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), elevated levels of which cause significant muscular abnormalities. Although there has been some advancement in understanding cellular and molecular mechanisms such as MuRF1/MAFbx/FOXO pathways and potential triggers behind muscle disuse, there is a significant gap in knowledge in the regulatory mechanism of the associated genes and their functional significance. It is known that anabolic and catabolic pathways regulate muscle atrophy in adult organisms. Deacetylase inhibitors represent a prototype of epigenetic drugs that have been proposed as a possible intervention that targets multiple signaling pathways in the pathogenesis of muscle atrophy. Niclosamide has also been proposed to regulate myogenesis and catabolic pathways in skeletal muscle. Datasets from the GeneLab repository [15] related to skeletal muscle atrophy were mined for studying the effects of microgravity and low radiation doses in low Earth orbit found beyond Earth’s atmosphere on mice. All the -omics datasets in GeneLab were preprocessed and normalized before being published. GLDS-111 and GLDS-135: Adult male mice C57BL/N6 were flown aboard the BION-M1 biosatellite for 30 days on orbit (BF) or housed in a replicate flight habitat on Earth (BG) as the reference flight control. GeneLab processed RNA sequencing data from mouse soleus and EDL muscles (GLDS-111) and longissimus dorsi and tongue (GLDS-135). The radiation inside the Bion-M1 mouse habitat dosimeters SPD2 and SPD4 recorded an average absorbed dose of 0.630 and 1.149 mGy, respectively. These are averages of low and high LET radiation doses. The total average absorbed radiation dose for the mission is 18.81 mGy and 34.30 mGy for the SPD2 and SPD4 dosimeters, respectively. The total average absorbed dose of Galactic Cosmic Radiation (GCR), Outer Radiation Belt (ORB), and Inner Radiation Belt (IRB) is 0.985 mGy. GLDS-21: Mice were flown on the STS-18 shuttle flight mission for 11 days, 19 h and gene expression analysis was performed on gastrocnemius muscle. Mice were maintained on earth for the same period. Additionally, to identify changes that were due to unloading and reloading, ground-based mice were subjected to hind limb suspension for 12 days and microarray analyses were conducted on their calf muscle. The average absorbed radiation dose is 2.19 mGy for the entire mission with an average absorbed radiation dose rate of 0.18 mGy. 2.2. Finding Regulatory Relationships between Gene Pairs (Stage 1) 2.3. Construction of Knowledge Graphs (Stage 2) The selected genes from Stage 1 are input to the Scalable Precision Medicine Open Knowledge Engine (SPOKE), which is a database of databases [19]. SPOKE is used for creating a network based on a data integration approach to prioritize disease-associated genes [20]. It is a graph-theoretic database organized in a hierarchical manner with inputs from molecular research, clinical insights, environmental data and others. Currently it integrates 19 different databases. The SPOKE creates a new graph with the provided list of skeletal muscle atrophy genes and the diseases associated with it. The list of genes and their associated diseases are input to Cytoscape to construct the Gene Disease Knowledge Graph (GDKG). The Disease Drug Knowledge Graph (DDKG) is constructed by finding the top ten drugs used to treat the diseases associated with skeletal muscle atrophy from the DrugBank database. A table of diseases and the top ranked drugs is built and input to Cytoscape to construct the DDKG. Graph Concepts and Properties for Analysis of GDKG and DDKG Graph concepts of random walk and preferential attachment used by the link prediction algorithms are described in this section. We also compute network measures on the constructed graphs. We follow Janwa, Massey, Velev and Mishra [21,22,23,24]. A graph is a representation of a set of entities and relations among them and represents an underlying concrete network, such as a GRN, the internet, or a social network. We formally present a graph as a pair of setsG=(V,E), whereVare the vertices (nodes, points) andE⊆V×Vare the edges (arcs), respectively. WhenEis a set of unordered pairs of vertices, the graph is said to be undirected. In a directed graph (representing key genes and target genes, for example)G=(V,E,o,t),Econsists of an ordered set of vertex pairs, i.e., for each edgee∈E,e→(o(e),t(e))whereo(e)is called the origin of the edgeeandt(e)is called the terminus of the edgee[22,23]. A graph is weighted if there is a map (weighting function,w:E→ℝ+), assigning to each edge a positive real-valued weight. Weighting can represent the strength of a signal in sender–receiver gene interaction, for example. A network’s properties are governed by its topology, such as the degree distribution, clustering coefficients, motifs, assortativity, hierarchicity, etc. (see [24,25,26]); a more in-depth treatment regarding biomedical networks is given in [27]. The degree of a vertexv,deg(v), is the number of edges that connect the vertex with other vertices. In other words, the degree is the number of immediate neighbors of a vertex. In directed graphs, the in-degree and out-degree of a vertex can be defined as the number of incoming and outgoing edges, respectively. Thus, the degree distributions can tell a great deal about the structure of a family of networks. As probability distribution, degree distribution can be binomial, Poisson, or Gaussian (in the limit), or as we will see, it can follow a power–law distribution that is characterized by a scale-free property. We say that a graph issparseif⟨k⟩=O(logN)(orM=O(NlogN)). In random probability models such as the Erdos-Renyi model, one does not find nodes of a very high degree. Similarity measures computed from neighborhoods in a graph are widely used in link prediction algorithms [28]. A semi-supervised scalable feature learning method is proposed in [29], where the authors develop a family of biased random walks resulting in a flexible search space of nodes for link (edge) prediction. We have used this method to obtain the highest ranked nodes for possible links between the muscle atrophy gene and its disease associations, as well as between diseases and drugs in the Graph Neural Network (GNN) method. Random walks: A walk of lengthnin a graph is a sequence of alternating vertices and edges,⟨v0,e1,v1,e2,…,en,vn⟩such that0(ei)=vi−1andt(ei)=vifor alli=1,…,n. LetTbe the diagonal matrix withdvalong the diagonal. First, we consider the stochastic matrixP=T−1A, which may be thought of as describing the probabilities of certain “information” being moved from one node to a neighboring node by a diffusion process. Let{v0,e1,v1,e2,⋯vs}be a random walk in the graph with(vi−1,vi)∈E(G), for all1≤i≤s, and determined by transition probabilitiesP(u,v)=Prob(xi+1=v|xi=u)which are independent ofi. Normally, we takep(u,v)=w(u,v)/du, as defined by the stochastic matrixP. Apart from random walks, we have computed preferential attachment measures to obtain possible gene–disease and disease–drug link associations. We follow [30] for computation of preferential attachment. For any nodeuletΓ(u)denote the set of neighbors ofu. LetΛbe a community ofG,i.e.,Λis a set of cohesive vertices such that it contains more connections inside the set than outside the set. The preferential attachment score ofuandvis defined as|Γ(u)||Γ(v)|. 2.4.1. Random Forest (RF) Method This method is based on decision trees, and an ensemble of trees is called a decision forest. Each tree is trained on a random subset of input features, and their predictions are combined to improve overall prediction. The tree is based on discriminants instead of likelihoods. Discriminants are estimated by passing class densities. The hyperparameters area: tree depth of 15 with 500 estimators. 2.4.2. Gradient Boosting (GB) Method The GB method is also an ensemble decision tree method which trains one tree at a time. The regression trees were built from the previous step on the prediction error of the previous tree. This is a useful method for tabular datasets. Multiple weak learners are combined to give a better performance. It can find nonlinear relationships between model targets and features and can deal with outliers, and missing values. The feature labels are the value of various node centralities. The positive and negative samples are the labels for the existent and non-existent edge in the network, respectively. The features of the nodes at the end of the edges, along with the positive or negative label, form a well-defined dataset for the task of link prediction. The learning rate is 0.2 for this algorithm. 2.4.3. Graph Neural Network (GNN) Method The GNN is a deep network with ten hidden layers with 100 nodes (neurons) in each of the hidden layers. The activation function for the hidden layers is the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLu) function. The limited-memory Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (lbfgs) solver from sktlearn library in Python was used to predict the links. The input layer of the GNN takes as input random walk features computed on the knowledge graphs. The output of the GNN is a matrix of predicted edges. 2.4.4. Graph Convolution Neural Network (GCN) Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is trained on the GDKG network. Figure shows the sparse GCN layer, ReLu activation function, graph embedding, and the decoded GCN with output predicted links between the genes and disease nodes. g1 and g2 are the gene nodes, d1, d2, and d3 are disease nodes. The output predicted links are shown as red dotted lines. 2.5. Gene-Disease and Disease-Drug Associations (Stage 4) Gene Disease Network (Red nodes–Genes, Blue nodes–Disease).
