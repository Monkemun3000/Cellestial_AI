  "content": "Release of CD36-associated cell-free mitochondrial DNA and RNA as a hallmark of space environment response Received 2022 Dec 9; Accepted 2023 Sep 20; Collection date 2024. Subject terms:Transcriptomics, Energy metabolism, Calcium and vitamin D It has been reported that a spaceflight causes mitochondrial stress in astronauts. Here the authors suggest that mitochondrial components are released into the plasma during spaceflight as components of CD36-marked extracellular vesicles (EVs). A detailed understanding of how the human body responds to spaceflight will be important to develop countermeasures for long-term space exploration1. Without effective solutions for aerospace health ailments, increasingly critical challenges will manifest as humanity ventures into crewed interplanetary travel. Solid biopsies have traditionally served as the gold standard for molecular monitoring of human physiology, but such invasive procedures require specialized equipment and carry an increased risk of infection and regional pain. To circumvent these difficulties, researchers on Earth have started to use blood or fluid samples, which are simpler to perform and require little to no recovery time, allowing for increased temporal resolution of sampling. These minimally invasive “liquid biopsies” permit the extraction of cell-free nucleic acids2,3, which are thought to detect changes earlier than conventional protein biomarkers4and to better resolve molecular heterogeneity than standard tissue biopsies5. Cell-free nucleic acids have emerged as potential space-relevant biomarkers of psychosocial and physical stress6, aging7, metabolic disorders8, and inflammation9, and have already been successfully utilized in various terrestrial healthcare contexts, including screening for infections10, diagnosing cancer11, and monitoring cancer recurrence and therapy12. On a similar note, cell-free nucleic acids can infer well-documented spaceflight responses, such as DNA damage13,14, in distal tissues without the need for invasive tissue biopsies15, which would be particularly difficult to conduct in orbit. Longitudinal and full-body molecular profiling using cell-free nucleic acids isolated from liquid biopsies is hence one viable avenue for advancing space healthcare. This approach may grant a detailed understanding of how the human body responds to the space environment and the development of modern countermeasures. Consenting astronauts could participate in lifetime surveillance through annual liquid biopsies, which could reveal the degree of full recovery from spaceflight responses, such as DNA damage and clonal hematopoiesis (CH), the latter of which causes increased lifelong risk of cardiovascular disease and blood cancers16,17. Liquid biopsies may be particularly constructive during interplanetary spaceflight missions, in which orbital healthcare autonomy will need to be optimized due to the large distance away from Earth. With the advent of the portable, nanopore-based Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION, nucleic acids could potentially be extracted and directly sequenced in-flight by crew to monitor their own health in near real time18–20. The NASA Twins Study provided a unique opportunity to perform a multi-omics analysis with monozygotic twin astronauts, where one participant resided on the ISS for 340 days, and the other remained on Earth16. The past few years have now welcomed the first studies to examine cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in astronauts, using data from the NASA Twins Study21and data collected 20 years prior with 14 astronauts on short-term missions22. These studies highlighted a theme of mitochondrial stress as a consistent spaceflight phenotype23, with bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) revealing mitochondrial RNA (mtRNA) spikes during flight, the levels of which were correlated to time spent on the ISS24, and plasma analysis revealing cell-free mitochondrial DNA (cf-mtDNA) spikes during flight21and in the immediate days after return22. Here, we report an independent study with six astronaut participants, where we examined plasma cfRNA profiles that reflect the longitudinal responses of internal tissues to the spaceflight environment. To disentangle microgravity from the various factors of the spaceflight environment, we directly compared our human plasma cfRNA data to mouse plasma cfRNA data from a published JAXA spaceflight mission that incorporated an artificial gravity device installed on the Japanese ISS Kibo Experiment Module25. Through this process, minimally invasive approaches were used in both species to gain a comprehensive overview of conserved environmental responses to microgravity, with increased mitochondrial components in plasma being one such prominent response.

Mean values (solid line) and SEM (error bar) were calculated from the same biologically independent samples as (c–k). Time-course profiles of cfRNAs linked to these tissue processes indicated that baseline levels of these RNAs tended to decrease during spaceflight and recover during post-flight phases (Fig.2c–k). Cerebellum-related genes calcium voltage-gated channel subunit alpha1 A (CACNA1A), HR (HR lysine demethylase and nuclear receptor corepressor), immunoglobulin superfamily member 9B (IGSF9B), and paired box 6 (PAX6) and skeletal muscle-related genes immunoglobulin-like and fibronectin type III domain containing 1 (IGFN1), ryanodine receptor 1 (RYR), and xin actin-binding repeat containing 1 (XIRP1) showed reduction during spaceflight. RNA levels of these genes showed a rapid increase at post-flight +3 days and decreased by post-flight +120 days. Skeletal muscle-related genes MAP3K7CL (MAP3K7 C-terminal like) and SH3BGRL (SH3 domain binding glutamate-rich protein like) showed opposite changes, with increased representation during spaceflight. Similar to mitochondrial RNAs, there were delays in the changes of RNA levels for tissue-specific genes during the transition from pre-flight to in-flight phases, but re-adaptation responses to the ground environment were faster. cfRNAs from genes involved in the vitamin D receptor signaling pathway, KANK2 (KN motif and ankyrin repeat domains 2), MN1 (MN1 proto-oncogene, transcriptional regulator), RXRA (retinoid X receptor alpha), and TRIM24 (tripartite motif containing 24), included a nuclear receptor and co-regulators. These RNA species were also altered in opposite directions between in-flight and post-flight phases (Fig.2l–o). Vitamin D plays a central role in inter-organ communication through hormones secreted by the parathyroid gland, which regulates skeletal and muscular health27. Changes in cfRNAs derived from these regulatory genes may indicate systemic shifts in mineral and metabolic homeostasis in space. Fig. 3.

The horizontal axis represents the corresponding tissue types listed above the graphs. Isolation of mitochondrial fraction An increase in plasma cell-free mitochondrial DNA and RNA indicated the presence of extracellular mitochondria (exMT) or the release of cytosolic mitochondrial components into the bloodstream during spaceflight. As unprotected nucleic acids in plasma are expected to be highly unstable, we hypothesized that cfDNA and cfRNA derived from mitochondria may be protected inside extracellular vesicles (EVs). We decided to isolate such EVs based on cell surface antigens for further characterization, as previously described29. To identify potential surface markers of EVs containing mitochondrial components, a panel of 361 antibodies was screened for enrichment of mtDNA (Fig.4a). Antibodies were pooled and mixed with in-flight and post-flight plasma samples, and antibody-bound materials were purified. Real-time PCR was used to evaluate the recovery of mtDNA in each purified material. Through three rounds of antibody screenings, only one antibody, the anti-CD36 antibody, consistently enriched mtDNA (Fig.4b–d). This enrichment was specific to in-flight plasma samples, consistent with the idea that mitochondrial components released in space are associated with CD36 as a surface molecular marker. Fig. 4.

CD36 has been well studied as a scavenger receptor expressed on various cell types. Although a direct link between CD36-expressing EVs and the release of mitochondrial components has not been reported, CD36 EVs have been described in the context of tissue injury and stress responses62. The release of CD36-expressing EVs from endothelial cells and skeletal muscles has been reported63,64. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that the CD36 fractions isolated from spaceflight plasma samples represent CD36 EVs that contain mtRNA and other RNAs derived from the nuclear genomes in their corresponding cells of origin. Our DNA and RNA-seq analysis of the CD36 fraction indicated qualitative differences in the mtDNAs and mtRNAs between the bulk plasma and CD36 fraction samples. Given that transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of mitochondrial gene expression has been described in the context of tissue-specificity and disease conditions50–52, further characterization of the CD36 fraction may provide clues to understanding spaceflight-associated mitochondrial responses. Tissue-specific RNAs identified space environmental responses in previously not well-characterized tissue types. The pituitary gland, thyroid gland, and parathyroid gland are thought to play central roles in the maintenance and alteration of homeostasis in space, but their small tissue sizes typically prevent their molecular analysis in animal models. These tissues are also inaccessible by direct sampling. It should be noted that the changes in the cfRNA profiles may represent altered tissue contributions as well as RNA expression changes in internal tissues, but our current study has limitations in distinguishing these possibilities. It is unclear if the two modes of cfRNA responses to spaceflight, an increase in mitochondrial components in plasma cfDNA and cfRNA and a decrease in other cfRNAs derived from internal tissues, are mechanistically related. It is also interesting that the tissue-specificity profiles of both groups of cfRNAs are similar, with brain and skeletal muscle as the most prominent tissue types. One of the potential explanations could be altered properties of blood–tissue barrier (BTB) functions. Recent studies reported altered integrity of the blood–brain barrier and blood–retinal barrier in space67,68. It is intriguing to note that both studies showed an association between oxidative stress and altered BTB-related molecular processes in space. Murakami et al. have reported seminal studies that directly linked gravity and environmental stressors to BTB regulation and inflammatory responses in the central nervous system (CNS), a process called the gateway reflex69–71. Thus, it is possible that the reduced release of cfRNAs from the brain into the plasma could be caused by a reduction in the BTB exchange of cfRNA-containing EVs triggered by microgravity or environmental stresses. As the gateway reflex is linked to pro-inflammatory signals through “IL-6-amplifier activation”, potential correlations to neuro-inflammatory responses in the brain and retinal tissues could be the targets for further analysis. As a specific clinical example, the plasma mtDNA-enriched CD36 fraction isolated from in-flight plasma samples contained tissue-specific RNAs indicating eye-related origins (Fig.4f), and visual diseases were also represented among the gravity-linked terms (Fig.6g). These findings indicate a possibility that liquid biopsies could be useful to detect early molecular events associated with retina tissue damage. Spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS) is one of the puzzling health issues in astronauts55. SANS is present in some astronauts after short and long duration spaceflight55and is defined as a constellation of unusual clinical findings, including optic disc edema, globe flattening, choroidal and retinal folds, hyperopic refractive error shifts, and nerve fiber layer infarcts72. The cause of SANS remains elusive, but two main hypotheses include elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) and compartmentalization of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to the area behind the globe73. Our study allowed for the resolution of gene expression in tissues that are traditionally difficult to access in humans, such as the retina and choroid plexus, both of which may be relevant to the study of SANS pathophysiology. Mitochondrial responses and ROS have been reported as characteristic features of neuro-inflammation in CNS and retinal diseases74. These changes have also been observed in mouse spaceflight experiments67,75. These studies, collectively, could suggest mitochondria-related processes, including the ROS and OXPHOS systems, as potential targets for countermeasure development to prevent health problems associated with spaceflight76,77. Overall, this example underlines that minimally invasive liquid biopsies could elucidate new perspectives on the cause of and countermeasures for unique space-related ailments. This study provided a unique opportunity to compare plasma cfRNA between mammalian species in a minimally invasive manner. The space environment consists of many factors, including microgravity, radiation, confinement, noise, altered air pressure and composition, and stress factors associated with launch and return. The use of on-board artificial 1-G controls in the published MHU-1 mission allowed us to identify gene categories specifically affected by the factor of microgravity, and nearly half (49.6%) of the enriched human disease terms were also observed in our human flight data. These gravity-linked terms were not limited to conventional disuse functions, such as bone and muscle loss, but also included metabolic stress responses, neurological disorders, and importantly, ocular and cardiovascular dysfunctions. With the development of sophisticated liquid biopsy technologies combined with multi-omics approaches, the rapid development of human research in space is expected to provide important insights that benefit human health both on and beyond Earth. The current human spaceflight study was proposed to and supported by the 2014 International Life Sciences Research Announcements, JAXA, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Ethics committee approvals were obtained at the University of Tsukuba, Institute of Medicine, Ethics Committee (No. 251, November 27, 2015), JAXA Institutional Review Board for Human Research (JX-IRBA-20–071, August 30, 2016), NASA Institutional Review Board (Pro1995, February 28, 2017), and European Space Agency (ESA) Medical Board (2017_04_09, April 20, 2017). Informed consent was obtained by the personal information manager of the study, and de-identified samples were made available to researchers who performed sample processing and data analysis. The study design and conduct complied with all relevant regulations regarding the use of human study participants and was conducted in accordance with the criteria set by the Declaration of Helsinki. The previously published Mouse Habitat Unit-1 (MHU-1) spaceflight mission is described by Shiba et al.25. Sample collection and transportation Human blood samples were collected using Vacutainer EDTA-plasma separate gel collection tubes (BD, cat. no. 362788) and frozen at −95 °C (ISS) or −80 °C (ground) after centrifugation for 30 min at 1239×g(3800 rpm, ISS) or 1600×g(ground). Frozen samples were transported to the University of Tsukuba after all samples were collected from the six astronauts. Mouse blood samples were collected from the inferior vena cava under anesthesia, and transferred into a 1.5 ml microfuge tube containing EDTA-2K for a final concentration of 5 mM. Plasma was obtained by centrifugation at 1500×gfor 10 min, and collected into a fresh tube. A 100 μl aliquot was frozen and transported to the University of Tsukuba. Plasma sample tubes were thawed on ice, aliquoted, and frozen at −80 °C. Plasma sample aliquots (120 μl) were thawed on ice, and centrifuged at 2000×gfor 10 min at 4 °C to remove cellular debris, and 100 μl supernatants were transferred into fresh tubes with 1 ml TRIzol-LS (Life Technologies, cat. no. 10296028). 200 μl of chloroform was added to the TRIzol sample, vortex mixed, and spun at 16,000×gfor 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were transferred into fresh tubes with 1 μl of glycogen (10 mg/ml stock, Roche, cat. no. 1091393001). 500 μl of isopropanol was added, mixed, and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. RNA pellets were recovered following centrifugation at 16,000×gfor 15 min and the removal of supernatants. Pellets were washed twice with 80% ethanol. RNA was resuspended in 8 μl of water. RNA concentrations were measured using the Qubit RNA HS Assay Kit (Invitrogen, cat. no.Q32852). Mouse plasma RNA was purified using the same method as human plasma RNA, except that, after the removal of cell debris, 50 μl of plasma aliquots were resuspended with 750 μl of TRIzol-LS and 200 μl of water. Cell debris was removed from the 120 μl plasma aliquot as described for the RNA purification, and 150 μl of SDS-Lysis Buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA, 1% SDS), 250 μl of TE Buffer (10 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA), and 10 μl of Pronase stock (Pronase from Streptomyces griseus, Roche Diagnostics, cat. no. 10165913103, dissolved in water at 20 mg/ml) were added and incubated at 42 °C for 1 h. To extract DNA, 500 μl of Phenol-CHCl3-Isoamylalchol (Wako, cat. no. 311-90151) was added and vortex mixed. The mixture was spun for 5 min at 16,000×g. The supernatant was transferred into a fresh 1.5 ml tube with 15 μl of 5 M NaCl and 1 μl of glycogen (10 mg/ml stock, Roche, cat. no. 1091393001). 1 ml of ethanol was added, mixed, and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The DNA pellet was recovered by centrifugation at 16,000×gfor 30 min. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was washed with 80% ethanol. DNA was resuspended in 20 μl of water. The DNA concentration was measured by the Qubit 1X dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Invitrogen, cat. no.Q33230). The quality of the purified RNA was examined by the RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies, cat. no. 5067-1513). Each sequencing library preparation used 2.5 μl of purified RNA. For the human plasma RNA and CD36-enriched RNA fractions, the SMART-seq Stranded Kit (Takara Bio, cat. no. 634443) was used at a half-volume scale following the user manual. The template amount was verified before the second PCR step by performing real-time PCR with the Fast SYBR Green Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 4385612) on a 1 μl aliquot of library reaction in order to adjust the PCR cycle for library amplification. PCR products were purified and eluted in 16 μl of Stranded Elution Buffer diluted with water at a 1:1 ratio. Mouse plasma RNA sequencing using the NEBNext Small RNA Library Kit (New England Biolabs, cat. no. E7330S) and 2 × 36 base paired-end sequencing with NextSeq500 (Illumina) were performed as described previously79. Reads in FASTQ files were imported into CLC Genomics Workbench (CLC-GW, ver.10.1.1, Qiagen), mapped to human (hg19) or mouse (mm10) reference genomes, and quantified using a 57,773-gene (human) or 49,585-gene (mouse) annotation set (downloaded from the CLC-GW server) to obtain the total count values, which were combined into a table. To plot normalized expression values, total counts were normalized by the scaling option in CLC-GW (normalization value = mean, reference = median mean, trimming 5%). Normalized total count values were log-2 transformed after adding a pseudocount of unity. ANOVAs and Empirical analyses of DRRs as described in figure legends were performed in CLC-GW. DNA was purified from input plasma and the CD36 fraction was sonicated with Bioruptor II (Sonic Bio) on the high setting for 10 min and converted to sequencing libraries using the NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs, cat no. E7645) at half-scale. Library products with insert sizes smaller than ~500 bp were selected using AMPure XP beads (Backman Coulter, cat. no. A63882). According to our examination, the majority of mtDNA were included in high-molecular-weight (>500 bp insert size) fractions in both total plasma cfDNA and DNA purified from the CD36 fraction. 2 × 36 base paired-end sequencing was performed, and FASTQ files were imported and mapped to the hg19 human reference genome by CLC-GW. Visualization of mapped RNA-seq and DNA-seq reads All the mapped RNA-seq reads for each sample were combined into pre-, in-, and post-flight groups. Due to variations in the data quantity and sample numbers in each phase, we decided to use all the reads for visualization. Mapped RNA-seq and DNA-seq reads were exported from CLC-GW as BAM format files, converted into bedGraph format files, and the sections corresponding to the mitochondrial genome were then selected and uploaded to the UCSC Genome Browser (https://genome.ucsc.edu/). Antibody screening and immunopurification of plasma fraction An antibody panel of 361 surface markers (LEGENDScreen Human PE Kit, BioLegend, cat. no. 700007, lot no. B328253) was used. Each antibody was reconstituted by adding 25 μl of water. For screening, 1 μl of each antibody was pooled. For the first round, 48 wells from rows A to H of four plates were pooled. For the second round, columns 1–6 and 8–12 of row G were combined into 6 pools. For the third round, antibodies from columns 2 and 8 in row G from four plates were used individually. For each round of screening, 120 μl of plasma aliquot was diluted with 750 μl of PBS, and 100 μl of diluted plasma was combined with pooled antibodies. The mixture was rotated at 4 °C for 1 h. At this incubation step, the dilution of each antibody was 1:100. For each immunopurification, 20 μl of Dynabeads Protein G (Invitrogen, cat. no. 1004D) were washed twice with PBS and resuspended in 30 μl of PBS with 1 μl of monoclonal goat anti-mouse IgM (Abcam, cat. no. ab9167, lot no. GR125217-5) and 0.1 mg/ml of BSA (New England Biolabs, B9001S). Washed Protein G beads were added to the plasma samples with antibodies and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. At this incubation step, the dilution of the IgM antibody combined with Protein G beads was 1:130. After binding, beads were washed twice with ice-cold PBS. Then, 25 μl of SDS–Lysis buffer, 25 μl of TE buffer, and 5 μl of pronase stock were added to the beads and incubated at 42 °C for 30 min. Eluted DNA was combined with 150 μl of TE. DNA was then purified following the plasma DNA purification protocol at half-scale.

Purification of CD36 plasma fraction and RNA extraction The 120 μl plasma aliquot was centrifuged to remove cell debris. The 100 μl supernatant was transferred into a fresh tube and combined with 650 μl of PBS, and 125 μl of the result was kept as input. The rest of the diluted plasma was combined with a diluted anti-CD36 antibody (2 μl of antibody and 40 μl of PBS with 1 × BSA per purification). The mixture was rotated at 4 °C for 1 h. Then, 20 μl of washed protein G beads combined with the goat anti-IgM antibody was added and rotated at 4 °C for 1 h. The supernatant was removed, and the beads were washed twice. Next, 1 ml of 1 × TRIzol (diluted TRIzol-LS with H2O at 3:1 for 1× concentration) was added to the washed beads. 850 μl of TRIzol-LS was added to the input. RNA was purified following the plasma RNA purification protocol. Pathway and tissue-specificity analysis Metascape 3.5 (https://metascape.org/gp/index.html) analysis was performed on filtered gene lists using default settings. Mouse genes were imported as mouse genes and analyzed as human genes. DAVID 2021 (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/tools.jsp) analysis was performed using default settings. Human gene expression profiles were obtained from the GTEx Portal (https://gtexportal.org/home) with the file that contains median gene-level transcript per million (TPM) by tissue “GTEx_Analysis_2017-06-05_v8_RNASeQCv1.1.9_gene_tpm.gct.gz”. Genes that matched within the filtered gene lists were selected for clustering and visualization. Plots, heatmaps, and visualization PCA plots, scatterplots, and normalized value plots were produced using the GraphPad Prism 9.3.1 software. Metascape and DAVID analysis output values and pathway terms were visualized using the bubble plot option in GraphPad Prism 9.3.1. Heatmaps were created using Morpheus (https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus/). Normalized log-2 total count values for filtered genes were exported from CLC-GW to Morpheus in Excel format. Clustering trees were produced using the One-minus Pearson option in the Morpheus clustering software. We thank the Japan Space Forum for project management, and N. Inoue, K. Murakami, and M.
