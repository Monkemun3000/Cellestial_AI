The mannose receptor C-type 1 (Mrc1) is a C-type lectin receptor expressed on the immune cells and sinusoidal endothelial cells (ECs) of several tissues, including the bone marrow (BM). Parallel to systemic metabolic alterations and hematopoietic cell proliferation, high-fat diet (HFD) feeding increases the expression of Mrc1 in sinusoidal ECs, thus calling for the investigation of its role in bone marrow cell reprogramming and the metabolic profile during obesity.Mrc1−/−mice and wild-type (WT) littermates were fed an HFD (45% Kcal/diet) for 20 weeks. Weight gain was monitored during the diet regimen and glucose and insulin tolerance were assessed. Extensive flow cytometry profiling, histological, and proteomic analyses were performed. After HFD feeding,Mrc1−/−mice presented impaired medullary hematopoiesis with reduced myeloid progenitors and mature cells in parallel with an increase in BM adipocytes compared to controls. Accordingly, circulating levels of neutrophils and pro-inflammatory monocytes decreased inMrc1−/−mice together with reduced infiltration of macrophages in the visceral adipose tissue and the liver compared to controls. Liver histological profiling coupled with untargeted proteomic analysis revealed thatMrc1−/−mice presented decreased liver steatosis and the downregulation of proteins belonging to pathways involved in liver dysfunction. This profile was reflected by improved glucose and insulin response and reduced weight gain during HFD feeding inMrc1−/−mice compared to controls. Our data show that during HFD feeding, mannose receptor deficiency impacts BM and circulating immune cell subsets, which is associated with reduced systemic inflammation and resistance to obesity development. The mannose receptor (Mrc1) is a unique type 1 transmembrane receptor that is a member of the C-type lectin family. Mrc1 can be located on non-vascular endothelium, macrophages [1], and dendritic cells [2] as well as in the serum in a shortened soluble form [3]. It presents eight C-type lectin domains (CTLDs), of which only number four is functional, and recognizes mannose, fucose, and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNac) [4]. Moreover, Mrc1 has a fibronectin type II (FNII) domain with a high affinity for collagen [5], and a terminal cysteine-rich (CR) domain which binds sulfated sugars [6]. Because of its complex structure, the mannose receptor recognizes several ligands, including circulating hormones [7,8] and adhesion molecules [9]. This aspect, together with its wide expression, allows Mrc1 to be involved in several processes including the immune response. It has been proposed that Mrc1 plays a key role during the immune response because of its ability to recognize mannose residues [10], expressed as terminal glycan moiety on lysosomal enzymes released during inflammation [11] or as part of microbial walls [12], and because of its participation in leukocyte trafficking. The mannose receptor expressed on sinusoidal endothelial cells interacts with the highly glycosylated protein CD44 on lymphocytes, directly regulating their trafficking [9]. Notably, Mrc1 is also expressed in the bone marrow compartment by both macrophages [13] and sinusoidal endothelium [14], which are known to modulate both the proliferation/maturation of hematopoietic stem cells and the extravasation of immune cells [15]. Conditions that cause systemic inflammation, such as metabolic disturbances and obesity [16], impair bone marrow hematopoiesis and promote the production of pro-inflammatory mediators by sinusoidal ECs [17]. The outcomes of these conditions also activate an immune inflammatory response within several target tissues, including the adipose tissue and the liver. The aims of our study were to investigate (1) the role of the mannose receptor in the bone marrow during obesity development and (2) the relationship between the mannose receptor function and changes in systemic inflammation. We fedMrc1−/−and control WT mice a high-fat diet (HFD) for 20 weeks and observed that Mrc1 deficiency resulted in reduced myelopoiesis associated with an increased adipocyte count in the bone marrow. This was associated with a significant reduction of circulating myeloid inflammatory cells together with a reduced infiltration of monocyte-derived macrophages in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and in the liver. The improved inflammatory response in Mrc1-deficient mice was paralleled by reduced body weight gain during HFD feeding, reduced liver steatosis, and improved glucose and insulin response compared to WT mice. These data suggest that the mannose receptor could be involved in the development of the immunometabolic response associated with diet-induced obesity. 2.2. Glucose and Insulin Tolerance Tests The glucose tolerance test (GTT) and insulin tolerance test (ITT) were used to measure the plasmatic clearance of glucose after intraperitoneal injection of glucose or insulin, respectively. For the GTT, animals were fasted overnight (approximately 14 h) and then blood glucose levels were measured at fasting and after 20, 40, 60, and 120 min from the injection of a glucose solution (10%w/vin physiological solution, 1 mg per gram of body weight). Blood glucose levels were measured with a glucometer (ONE-TOUCH Ultra glucometer, Lifescan, Milpitas, CA, USA). For the ITT, animals were fasted for 4 h and then glucose plasma levels were measured at fasting and after 20, 40, 60, and 120 min from the injection of human recombinant insulin (0.75 mU per gram of body weight, Humulin R U-100, 100 U/mL). 2.3. Sample Preparation for Flow Cytometry 2.4. Femurs, Liver, and Adipose Tissues Histology Mouse femurs were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 4 h at 4 °C, decalcified in 0.5 M EDTA pH 8 for 5 days at 4 °C, and frozen in liquid nitrogen-cooled isopentane. Longitudinal femur sections (10 μm thick) were incubated with anti-perilipin 1 antibody (1:200; Cat. No. 9349, Cell Signalling Technology®, Danvers, MA, USA). An anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, USA) diluted to 1:200 in PBS plus 1% BSA was incubated for 40 min at 37 °C. Nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33342 (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). Images (10×) were acquired with a Leica DM6B automated upright microscope (Leica Biosystems S.r.l., Milan, Italy) and then processed with Fiji/ImageJ software (version 1.50, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). Adipocytes were manually quantified with Fiji/ImageJ based on perilipin-1 immunostaining. Part of the liver, VAT, SCAT, and BAT was fixed overnight in 4% buffer formalin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) embedded in paraffin and then 5 µm tissue sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) (Sigma-Aldrich). Images of H&E-stained sections were acquired using the Axiovision Zeiss software (version 4.8, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) at 10× magnification. We evaluated liver steatosis using ImageJ software and the adipocytes area of VAT and SCAT using the Adiposoft Plugin, considering two fields per section, for a total of 10 sections per animal. To assess hepatic neutrophil activation, immunohistochemistry staining of liver sections was performed using the Anti-Neutrophil Elastase antibody (1:200; Cat. No. ab68672, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) followed by the HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1:750; Sigma-Aldrich), a reaction with DAB Liquid Substrate System (Sigma-Aldrich), and nuclei counterstaining with haematoxylin (Sigma-Aldrich). Images were acquired with Axiovision Zeiss software at 10x magnification and elastase-positive areas were quantified with ImageJ software. 2.6. Quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) For the gene expression analysis, brown adipose tissue was homogenized with TissueRuptor II (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Lipid Tissue Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was first quantified with a NanoDrop 1000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and then retro-transcribed to cDNA with iScript™ Reverse Transcription Supermix (Cat. No. 1708841, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). A 20 ng sample of the cDNA was used for amplification by real-time quantitative PCR (CFX Connect Real-Time PCR Detection System instrument, Cat. No. 1855201, Bio-Rad) with the Luna®Universal qPCR Master Mix (Cat. No. M3003E, New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). For each amplification, 1 µM of each primer was used to a final volume of 15 µL of the reaction mix with 7.5 µL of the master MIX. 3.2. Mrc1 Deficiency in Mice Fed with a High-Fat Diet Impacts Immune Infiltration of Metabolic Tissues during Obesity 3.3. Immunomodulation in Mrc1−/−Mice Is Associated with Improved Obese Phenotype Metabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, are associated with increased hematopoiesis [27] and dysfunctional endothelium, which in turn contribute to disrupting myelopoiesis [17]. This pro-inflammatory hematopoiesis not only aggravates the dysmetabolic condition but also stands as an important risk factor for cardiovascular diseases [28], calling for an investigation of the molecular mechanisms driving this effect. Intriguingly, the soluble mannose receptor has been shown to stimulate tissue macrophage activation towards inflammation, and its deficiency in mice fed an HFD resulted in reduced tissue inflammation and a better metabolic phenotype [25]. Interestingly, Mrc1 is expressed by both macrophages and medullary sinusoidal endothelial cells [14], where its expression increases following the onset of diabetes mellitus within a panel of inflammatory genes [17]. Highly active myelopoiesis observed in dysmetabolic conditions is commonly associated with a systemic immune activation characterized by the increased frequency of blood inflammatory cells and circulating markers of inflammation [29]. In our experimental setting, decreased levels of circulating neutrophils and pro-inflammatory CCR2+monocytes were indeed associated with the bone marrow phenotype switch in Mrc1-deficient mice. Our work revealed that the lack of the mannose receptor modulates myelopoiesis, thus hampering the enhancement observed in animals fed with an HFD to induce obesity [30]. We demonstrated an important downregulation of myeloid cell production as well as an increased presence of adipocytes. Considering the role of CXCL12 in promoting HSCs quiescence, an increase in adipocytes, a known source of CXCL12, could negatively modulate hematopoiesis by reducing the production of inflammatory cells [22]. As a confirmation, our plasma proteomics analysis showed that the lack of the mannose receptor is paralleled by an overall reduction in leukocyte migration and the tissue infiltration pathways. Notably, changes in glycoprotein catabolism play a critical role in lipoprotein metabolism and cardiometabolic diseases [31]. Therefore, we investigated the immune phenotype of the visceral adipose tissue and liver, as they represent tissues at the crossroad between the metabolic and inflammatory response to obesity [32,33]. In Mrc1-deficient mice, both tissues presented a reduced infiltration of myeloid cells that contributed to an amelioration of the metabolic response during HFD. Indeed, the recruitment of monocytes from circulation to adipose tissue promotes the differentiation of macrophages with a pro-inflammatory phenotype at the cost of anti-inflammatory macrophages [34]. Of note, in this study, we used whole-bodyMrc1knock-out mice. Therefore, it is possible that cells other than macrophages contributed to the phenotype observed. Indeed, in addition to macrophages, the mannose receptor is expressed by a variety of cells including non-immune cells, such as sinusoidal endothelial cells [1]. These cells have been implicated in leucocyte trafficking in lymphatic vessels [9]. Therefore, future studies should investigate whether leucocyte trafficking could also play a role in the observed phenotype. In conclusion, we have shown that, during the onset of obesity, Mrc1 impacts hematopoietic stem cell differentiation and release. In addition, Mrc1 deficiency impacts the BM cell profile and reduces the number of activated immune cells in circulation and their infiltration in tissues, thus dampening obesity development.
