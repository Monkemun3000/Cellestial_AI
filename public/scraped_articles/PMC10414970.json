Plant roots navigate in the soil environment following the gravity vector. Cell divisions in the meristem and rapid cell growth in the elongation zone propel the root tips through the soil. Actively elongating cells acidify their apoplast to enable cell wall extension by the activity of plasma membrane AHA H+-ATPases. The phytohormone auxin, central regulator of gravitropic response and root development, inhibits root cell growth, likely by rising the pH of the apoplast. However, the role of auxin in the regulation of the apoplastic pH gradient along the root tip is unclear. Here, we show, by using an improved method for visualization and quantification of root surface pH, that theArabidopsis thalianaroot surface pH shows distinct acidic and alkaline zones, which are not primarily determined by the activity of AHA H+-ATPases. Instead, the distinct domain of alkaline pH in the root transition zone is controlled by a rapid auxin response module, consisting of the AUX1 auxin influx carrier, the AFB1 auxin co-receptor, and the CNCG14 calcium channel. We demonstrate that the rapid auxin response pathway is required for an efficient navigation of the root tip. Plants colonize soil by the growth of their roots. Because plant cells are non-motile, mechanically coupled by their cell walls and symplastically connected by plasmodesmata, the extent and direction of root growth is driven by the elongation of cells that can differ across the organ (Braidwood et al., 2014). The balance between cell proliferation and differentiation in the root apex is controlled by several phytohormone and peptide signaling pathways, among which auxin plays a specific role, thanks to its long-distance intercellular transport that serves as the information carrier between distant plant tissues (Grieneisen et al., 2007;Wisniewska et al., 2006). The root apex is divided in several zones fulfilling various roles in root development. At the tip of the root, the root cap covers and protects the meristem, and is the center of gravity perception. In the meristem, stem cells produce transit-amplifying cells that populate the root tip (Dolan et al., 1993;Campilho et al., 2006). In the model plantArabidopsis thaliana, the root cap reaches up to the transition zone, where cells stop dividing and prepare for elongation; the transition zone is characterized by a distinct physiology and shows a high responsiveness to external factors (Verbelen et al., 2006). Further in the shootward direction, cells rapidly elongate in the elongation zone, propelling the root tip through the soil (Beemster and Baskin, 1998). After reaching their final length, cells differentiate in the maturation zone, where the root hairs emerge presumably to increase the absorptive root surface. To elongate, cells must expand their cell walls, increase turgor pressure or both (Lintilhac, 2014). Proton extrusion into the apoplast by the plasma membrane (PM) H+ATPases is crucial for both cell wall expansion and turgor maintenance. Acidic pH leads to activation of cell wall remodeling enzymes, and the H+gradient at the PM drives the transport of most nutrients and ions, and as such is required for turgor pressure generation (Falhof et al., 2016). It is therefore not surprising that root zones of numerous species show a distinct pattern of surface proton fluxes and cell wall pH (Siao et al., 2020). In general, the tip of the root and the late elongation and maturation zones show outward H+fluxes, while the transition zone and early elongation zones show inward H+fluxes (Weisenseel and Meyer, 1997). Several studies showed that this battery-like system, with positive charges flowing out of the maturation zone and entering at the transition zone, is mainly driven by H+fluxes without completely excluding calcium and chloride ions (Weisenseel et al., 1979;Björkman and Leopold, 1987;Behrens et al., 1982;Iwabuchi et al., 1989). Similar pattern of H+fluxes was determined inA. thaliana, where the fluxes also correlated with root surface pH: an alkaline domain was observed at the border between meristematic and transition zones (Staal et al., 2011). Other works have attempted to determine the pH of the epidermal cell walls, and show a general decrease of pH toward the maturation zone of the root (Barbez et al., 2017;Moreau et al., 2022;Großeholz et al., 2022). It is important to keep in mind that changes in proton fluxes and membrane potential are not always correlated with change in pH. For example, a simultaneous leak of protons and uptake through H+/K+symporter in the cytoplasm can lead to apoplast acidification with a relatively stable membrane potential (Stanković, 2006). In general, the relationship between H+fluxes, cell wall pH, and the growth rate in the particular zones remains unclear: the highest pH is observed in the transition and early elongation zones, while the lowest pH and highest outward H+fluxes are observed in the maturation zone where cells do not elongate. In particular, the mechanism of the alkaline domain formation and its physiological significance remain unclear. The apoplastic pH is largely controlled by the activity of the proton pump H+ATPases, encoded by 11 genes in theA. thalianagenome; in roots, the dominant paralogs are AHA1 and AHA2 (Haruta et al., 2010). While their activity is mainly regulated by phosphorylation (Falhof et al., 2016), the expression and membrane localization of AHAs along the longitudinal root axis seems to be important for the zonation of theA. thalianaroot.Haruta et al., 2018, showed that under conditions of dim light, the AHA2-mCitrine was less abundant in the membranes of transition zone cells, and this partially correlated with higher surface pH of the transition zone cells. Under conditions of light, the AHA2-mCitrine localizes to the membranes in the transition zone.Pacifici et al., 2018, presented a model where cytokinin signaling regulates root meristem size by controlling the expression of AHA1 and AHA2. Increased cytokinin signaling led to shortening of the meristem, similarly to an inducible relocalization of AHA2 fused to the glucocorticoid receptor. Finally,Großeholz et al., 2022, quantified the AHA2-GFP signal and demonstrated an increasing AHA2-GFP membrane abundance toward the maturation zone ofA. thalianaroot, which correlated with increased acidification of the root surface. Still, the observed patterns of proton fluxes along the root zones (Weisenseel and Meyer, 1997), and in particular the existence of the alkaline domain around the transition zone of the root, cannot be simply explained by the expression or abundance of AHA proton pumps. Here, by employing an improved method for visualization and quantification of root surface pH, we focus on the molecular actors involved in the establishment of the longitudinal surface pH zonation. In particular, we show that the alkaline domain around the transition zone is not caused by the lack of AHA H+ATPases activity. Further, we demonstrate that the alkaline domain at the transition zone is controlled by the components of the rapid auxin response pathway. Finally, we address the significance of the dynamic surface pH profile for the gravitropic response of the roots. TheArabidopsisroot shows distinct acidic and alkaline root surface pH domains The alkaline domain in the transition zone is not directly determined by AHA activation or localization The manipulation of the AHA proton pump activity resulted in the expected outcome of influencing the overall root surface pH and root growth. However, the spatial organization of the root surface pH profile with the alkaline domain of the TZ does not appear to be simply controlled by the activation or abundance of AHAs, as the alkaline domain cannot be fully removed by genetic or pharmacological modulation of the proton pumping activity. The establishment of the alkaline pH domain requires AUX1 The components of the rapid auxin response pathway steer the transition zone root surface pH The AUX1-AFB1-CNGC14 module facilitates root navigation Video 1.

High-resolution dynamics of root surface pH in Col-0, aux1, afb1, and cngc14 roots. The movie is assembled from individual movies, the lookup table is set identically for all genotypes. In summary, the alkaline surface pH domain originates from a constant rapid auxin response driven by the AUX1-AFB1-CNGC14 module. This response enables the roots to rapidly react to gravity vector changes and to adjust the root tip growth direction. According to the acid growth theory, acidic pH enables cell wall extension (Rayle and Cleland, 1992;Hager, 2003). We observed the lowest pH values in the very tip of the root and in the maturation zone where cells do not elongate. On the other hand, the alkaline domain partially covers the early elongation zone. The surface pH therefore does not fully correlate with the local growth rates (Beemster and Baskin, 1998;Shih et al., 2015). In addition, it remains to be resolved to what extent the surface pH correlates with the pH of the cell walls and the apoplastic space of the root epidermal cells, as previous work has reported a correlation between cell length and cell wall pH (Barbez et al., 2017;Moreau et al., 2022). It is possible that rather than driving cell elongation, the acidic domain in the maturation zone plays a role in nutrient acquisition and absorption by the root hairs (Martín-Barranco et al., 2021). The cytokinin-mediated cell wall stiffening may become the dominant growth-regulating mechanism in this root zone, leading to growth cessation despite low extracellular pH (Liu et al., 2022). Based on genetic and pharmacological experiments we concluded that the longitudinal surface pH zonation is not based solely on the activity and abundance of PM AHA H+ATPases, but instead, the alkaline domain in the transition zone is driven by AUX1-mediated auxin influx and AFB1 signaling. The surface pH might be determined solely by AHA activity in the specific case of theaux1mutant, where the pH progressively decreases in the shootward direction, and might then reflect the AHA activity gradient that is determined by the abundance of the proton pumps and their regulation by brassinosteroid signaling, as suggested byGroßeholz et al., 2022. Interestingly, even in theaux1mutant, a residual AHA-independent alkaline domain is present and can be visualized when AHAs are hyperactivated by the application of FC. What is the cause of the alkaline domain at the transition zone, if not the inhibition of AHA ATPase activity? It was shown that the auxin-induced apoplast and root surface alkalinization is accompanied by a decrease in cytosolic pH (Monshausen et al., 2011;Li et al., 2021), indicating that the alkaline domain visualized by the FS is caused by a proton influx into cells. The phenotype of theaux1mutant hints to the possibility that the AUX1-mediated auxin symport with protons (Lomax et al., 1985) might cause the observed root surface alkalinization. Also supporting this hypothesis, the transition zone of maize roots is the site of the highest auxin influx, as measured by an auxin-specific electrode (Mancuso et al., 2005). On the other hand, theaux1mutant was capable of surface alkalinization when higher concentrations of IAA were added, demonstrating that the AUX1-mediated influx per se is not required for surface alkalinization. Further, theafb1mutants show a defect in the alkaline domain formation, which favors the explanation that the auxin-induced alkalinization is triggered from the AFB1 receptor. Given that the mutant in CNGC14 is defective in establishing root surface pH profile, auxin-induced alkalinization and auxin-induced calcium influx (Shih et al., 2015), and calcium influx and pH changes are tightly coupled (Behera et al., 2018), we conclude that CNGC14 functions downstream of AFB1. Similarly,Li et al., 2021, suggested that auxin-induced alkalinization of the apoplast is mediated by a yet unknown mechanism. It is intriguing to speculate that the signaling pathway might operate via the adenylate cyclase activity of TIR1/AFB auxin receptors (Qi et al., 2022). Upon gravistimulation, the alkaline domain on the lower side of the root increased rapidly, while on the upper side, the alkaline domain diminished and the root surface acidified, which is consistent with previous pH measurements done by electrodes (Zieschang et al., 1993;Monshausen et al., 1996), indicating that the alkaline domain corresponds to a zone of a stalled cell elongation that can be rapidly regulated upon gravistimulation. In addition to the gene expression changes that occur during obstacle avoidance (Jacobsen et al., 2021) and the FERONIA-mediated mechanoperception (Shih et al., 2014), the rapid auxin response module in the root decreases the reaction time of the root to the changes of root growth direction, and thus increases the efficiency of root soil penetration. We used the Col-0 ecotype and the following mutant and transgenic lines. The PIN2>>AHA2delta95, PIN2>>PP2C-D1 originate from this study, see Molecular cloning. Further, we used theaha2-4(SALK_082786),pp2c-d2/5/6triple mutant (Ren et al., 2018) (pp2c-d2 WsDsLOX493G12, pp2c-d5GABI_330E08, and pp2c-d6 SAIL_171H03),aux1-100(SALK_020355),pin2(NASC_N16706). Theafb1-3and AFB1::AFB1-mCitrine inafb1-3originate fromPrigge et al., 2020. Theafb1-1s(SALK_144884C) was genotyped using the following primers SALK_LBb1.3,AACGGAAGACTAGGAAGCGAG,GCAACAGCTTCAAGACCTTTG. Thecngc14-1(SALK_206460) was genotyped by SALK_LBb1.3,CACCTGCTTGTAAAGCAAAGG,TCGGAACAATTGGCAGAATAC;cngc14-2(wiscDsLox437E09) by WisDsLox_LBP (AACGTCCGCAATGTGTTATTAAGTTGTC),TGTTTCACGTAAAGTCAAACCC,TAAGAATCCAAGTGGCCACAC. The CNGC14::CNGC14-GFP (see Molecular cloning) was transformed into thecngc14-1andcngc14-2homozygous lines. Thetir tripleis thetir1,afb2,3mutant (Dharmasiri et al., 2005). We used thetmk1-1 (SALK_016360),tmk4-1 (GABI_348E01) (Li et al., 2021), and theabp1-TD1(SK21825) (Gao et al., 2015). AUX1::AUX1-YFP (Swarup et al., 2004) was introduced intoafb1-3andcngc14-2by crossing. AUX1::AUX1-YFP was crossed with PIN::PIN2-mCherry (Retzer et al., 2019). Seeds were surface-sterilized by chlorine gas for 2 hr. Seeds were sown on 1% (wt/vol) plant agar (Duchefa) with ½ Murashige Skoog salts (MS, Duchefa), 1% (wt/vol) sucrose, adjusted to pH 5.8 with KOH, and stratified for 2 days at 4°C. Seedlings were vertically grown for 5 days in a growth chamber at 23°C by day (16 hr), 18°C by night (8 hr), 60% humidity, and light intensity of 120 µmol photons/m2/s. The tissue-specific estradiol-inducible lines were prepared as follows. For PIN2>>AHA2delta95, we cloned the CDS 1-886 of AHA2 (AT4G30190) lacking the last 95 amino acids as inPacheco-Villalobos et al., 2016, and fused mScarlet-I (Bindels et al., 2017) to the C-terminal part. For PIN2>>PP2C-D1, we cloned the CDS of PP2C-D1 (AT5G02760) and fused mScarlet-I to the C-terminal part. Both constructs were cloned downstream of the 4xLexA Operon fused to CaMV 35S minimal promoter (Sarrion-Perdigones et al., 2013) and the transcriptional units were terminated by the 35S terminator and cloned into the alpha1-3 vectors (Dusek et al., 2020). XVE (Zuo et al., 2000) was cloned under the control of the PIN2 promoter (1.4 kb upstream of the AT5G57090), terminated by the RuBisCo terminator fromPisum sativumand the resulting transcriptional unit was cloned into alpha1-1 vector. The alpha transcriptional units were then interspaced with matrix attachment regions (Dusek et al., 2020), combined with a Basta resistance cassette and introduced into the pDGB3omega1 binary vector (Sarrion-Perdigones et al., 2013). The CNGC14::CNGC14-GFP construct contains the CNCG14 promoter (1.5 kb upstream of the start codon) and the CNGC14 coding sequence (the AT2G24610.1 splice variant) with the GFP fused to the C-terminus and 35S terminator. This transcriptional unit was combined with a kanamycin resistance cassette and FastRed marker for rapid selection of transgenic seeds into the pDGB3omega1 binary vector. All cloning steps were performed using the GoldenBraid methodology (Sarrion-Perdigones et al., 2013;https://gbcloning.upv.es/). Col-0 ecotype (PIN2>>AHA2delta95, PIN2>>PP2C-D1) orcngc14-1andcngc14-2lines (CNGC14-mVenus) were transformed using the floral dip method (Clough and Bent, 1998). Pharmacological treatments and dyes Treatments were prepared using the following chemicals: IAA (10 mM stock in ethanol; Sigma-Aldrich), FC (1 mM stock in ethanol; Sigma-Aldrich), estradiol (20 mM stock in DMSO; Sigma-Aldrich). Fluorescein Dextran 10,000 MW, Anionic (D1821, Thermo Fisher) - 10 mg/ml stock in miliQ H2O, final concentration in media is 29 µg/ml. Oregon Green 488 Dextran, 10,000 MW (D7170, Invitrogen) - 1 mg/ml stock in miliQ H2O, final concentration in media is 2.5 µg/ml. HPTS (H1529, Sigma-Aldrich), 100 mM stock in H2O, final concentration in media is 1 mM. FS (F1130, Thermo Fisher), 100 or 50 mM stock in H2O, final concentration in media is 50 µM. Induction of PIN2>>AHA2delta95 and PIN2>>PP2C-D1 lines was done by incubating 5-day-old seedlings for 2.5 hr in 1/2 MS MES buffered media (g/l), 1% sucrose, pH 5.8 containing 2 µM estradiol before experiments. Measurement of FS excitation and emission spectra For measurement of fluorescent spectra of FS, ½ MS media with 1% sucrose were prepared with pH 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0 (adjusted with KOH). FS stock (50 mM in H2O) was added to the media to achieve a final concentration of 50 µM. For the measurement, 200 µl of this media was pipetted into a 96-well plate, five wells per each pH value and the spectras were measured using Spark multimode microplate reader (Tecan). The values for each pH were averaged and plotted. Measurement of FS range and effects of salts and redox status on FS signal For the gravitropic experiments, the seedlings were rotated ±90°. Only roots with a starting angle of 90°±10° were selected for analysis to obtain homogeneous gravitropic stimulations. Surface pH imaging was performed using a vertical stage Zeiss Axio Observer 7 with Zeiss Plan-Apochromat 10×/0.8, coupled to a Yokogawa CSU-W1-T2 spinning disk unit with 50 µm pinholes and equipped with a VS401 HOM1000 excitation light homogenizer (Visitron Systems). Images were acquired using the VisiView software (Visitron Systems). FS was sequentially excited with a 488 and 405 nm laser and the emission was filtered by a 500–550 nm bandpass filter. Signal was detected using a PRIME-95B Back-Illuminated sCMOS Camera (1200×1200 pixels; Photometrics). The Flat field correction mode was used for image acquisition. For vertical growth experiments, seedlings were imaged every 10 min for 30 min. The profiles shown correspond to the first time frame while the root elongation was calculated over the whole experiment. Imaging to observe oscillations of the root surface pH was conducted by imaging every 5 s. For gravitropic experiments, seedlings were imaged using the sandwich method (https://doi.org/10.1017/qpb.2022.4) every 2 min for 42 min. The profile shown corresponds to the last time frame except specified otherwise. The angles were quantified over the entire duration of the experiment. Whole mount immunolocalization of 5-day-oldA. thalianaseedlings was performed as described previously inSauer et al., 2006, with the following modifications. The protocol was adapted to the InSituPro VS liquid-handling robot (Intavis AG, Germany). Prior to immunolocalization, seedlings were fixed 1 hr with 4% paraformaldehyde dissolved in MTSB (50 mM PIPES, 5 mM EGTA, 5 mM MgSO4·7H2O pH 7, adjusted with KOH) at room temperature. In the robot, procedure started with 5×15 min washes with MTSB-T (MTSB+0.01% Triton X-100) then the cell wall was digested by 30 min treatment at 37°C with 0.05% Pectolyase Y-23 supplemented with 0.4 M mannitol in MTSB-T, followed by 2×30 min membrane permeation with 10% DMSO and 3% Igepal in MTSB-T. The samples were blocked 1 hr with BSA (blocking solution: 2% BSA in MTSB-T) and incubated 4 hr at 37°C with primary (antiAHA rabbit antibody, Agrisera AS07260, RRID:AB_1031584) and 3 hr at 37°C with secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 555 goat, anti-rabbit, Abcam ab150078, RRID:AB_2722519). The antibodies were diluted in 2% BSA in MTSB-T in concentration: 1:500 for primary and 1:1000 for secondary antibody. Between the all described steps the seedlings were washed 5×15 min with MTSB-T. For the final step, MTSB-T was exchanged by deionized water. From the robot seedlings were transferred to microscopy slides into 50% glycerol in deionized water and fluorescence signal was imaged by Zeiss LSM 880 inverted confocal scanning microscope equipped with Airyscan detector with 40×/1.2 C-Apochromat objective. Four-day-old seedlings were transferred on ½ MS, 1% (wt/vol) plant agar, 1% (wt/vol) sucrose, pH 5.8, covered with sterilized nylon meshes of pore sizes of 109, 119, 139 µm (polyamide mesh UHELON). Plates were grown overnight vertically and then were tilted to 45° and grown 24 hr. After that, the root penetration through the mesh was scored using a binocular microscope. The penetration efficiency was calculated by normalizing each variant (genotype × pore size) to the Col-0 efficiency in the 139 µm variant in the particular repetition. In addition, the reference Col-0 was normalized to the Col-0 average over all repeats. The averages and SD of surface pH or alkalinization factor in function of the distance from the root tip were plotted using the Sourcecode1.py Python script. The root elongation boxplots and the associated statistics were performed using the Sourcecode2.R: R script. Sample size and biological replicates were determined as the maximum number of roots fitting the microscopy chamber, this number being influenced by the number of conditions and genotypes for a given experiment. Experiment technical replicates were arbitrarily set to three replicates. Fluorescence values were measured blindly by fully automated scripts. Data depicted in this publication represent a pool of technical and biological replicates. No technical or biological replicates were excluded from this publication. Graphics were created with the R software or in Python (v3.8) with the Seaborn plugin (v0.11.2,https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.03021) and aesthetic modifications of the graphs (fonts, size) were modified in Inkscape (v1.0).

The experiment lacks good negative and positive controls (see reviewer 1) and quantification of the signal. Also, reviewer 2 indicates that the nature and specificity of the antibody have not been properly described. Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors): line 301ff: Would be nice to give an idea of the time scale of the pH variations in vertically growing roots? It appears that the fluorescence intensity variation on each side of the root also may show some periodicity. Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors): – Improve the presentation of the more acidic and alkaline domains. In Figures 1e, and f it would be beneficial to highlight the three regions.
