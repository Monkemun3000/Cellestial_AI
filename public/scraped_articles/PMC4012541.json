Department of Surgery, University of California, San Francisco, 521 Parnassus Ave., C341, San Francisco, CA 94143-0790, USA, Tel: 415-476-6069; Fax: 415-476-8694;tammy.chang@ucsf.edu Three-dimensional (3D) culture of hepatocytes leads to improved and prolonged synthetic and metabolic functions, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are unknown. In order to investigate the role of 3D cell-cell interactions in maintaining hepatocyte differentiated functionsex vivo, primary mouse hepatocytes were cultured either as monolayers on tissue culture dishes (TCD) or as 3D aggregates in rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactors. Global gene expression analyses revealed that genes upregulated in 3D culture were distinct from those upregulated during liver development and liver regeneration. Instead, they represented a diverse array of hepatocyte-specific functional genes with significant over-representation of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (Hnf4a) binding sites in their promoters. Expression ofHnf4aand many of its downstream target genes were significantly increased in RWV cultures as compared to TCD. Conversely, there was concomitant suppression of mesenchymal and cytoskeletal genes in RWV cultures that were induced in TCDs. These findings illustrate the importance of 3D cell-cell interactions in maintaining fundamental molecular pathways of hepatocyte function and serve as a basis for rational design of biomaterials that aim to optimize hepatocyte functionsex vivofor biomedical applications. Three-dimensional (3D) cell culture is critical for understanding the function of cells in a physiologically relevant context and for tissue engineering complex solid organs like the liver [1]. 3D culture of hepatocytes has been shown to maintain the differentiated functions of hepatic cell lines [2] and primary cells [3,4] as well as promote differentiation of stem cells toward the hepatic lineage [5–8]. Sustained differentiated functions of hepatocytes in 3D culture could be harnessed for drug toxicity screening [9,10] or to improve the efficacy of extracorporeal liver-assist devices [11]. In addition, 3D aggregation may facilitate transplantation of hepatocytes kept in culture, which would be particularly useful for hepatocytes derived from pluripotent stem cells [12,13]. While differentiated functions are improved in hepatocytes cultured either on 3D scaffolds [14–17] or as self-aggregated 3D spheroids [2–4], little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms that lead to those improved functions in 3D culture. Using the rotating wall vessel (RWV) system, we previously showed that one important factor for sustaining differentiated functions of a human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line is sustained 3D cell-cell interactions [2]. RWVs are rotational bioreactors with a gas permeable membrane that, when in operation, are completely filled with culture media so that it functionally rotates as a solid-body around a horizontal axis. This creates a suspension culture environment with minimal fluid shear stress and turbulence, allowing cells to co-localize and self-aggregate with 3D spatial freedom [18]. Studies have shown that hepatocyte spheroids cultured under these conditions could develop into larger sizes with less hypoxic limitations to the inner core compared to stationary culture [19]. Human hepatocytes and non-parenchymal cells co-cultured within RWVs demonstrated formation of complex 3D micro-architectures, including microvilli, bile canaliculi, and sinusoidal fenestrations [20,21]. Importantly, as tissue engineering strategies advance and the definitions of biomaterials evolve, self-aggregated hepatocyte spheroids developed within bioreactors may be considered biomaterials in their own right [22]. Self-aggregated cellular spheroids are the building blocks for organ printing, a bottom up synthesis approach to tissue engineering [23]. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms that regulate hepatocyte functions within 3D spheroids is critical for the optimization of organ function within a printed liver. Moreover, hepatocyte spheroids generated within RWVs allow investigation of the biological effects of 3D cell-cell interactions without the influence of contacting scaffolds, surfaces, or carriers. In this study, we performed global gene expression and promoter region analyses on primary mouse hepatocytes cultured on collagen-coated tissue culture dishes (TCDs) or RWVs to determine the underlying molecular mechanisms important for maintaining hepatocyte-specific functions in 3D culture. Primary hepatocytes were isolated from male C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME). All mice were handled in accordance with the “Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals” and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. 2.2. Hepatocyte Isolation and Culture Mouse primary hepatocytes were isolated by the two-step perfusion technique using Liver Perfusion and Liver Digest Media (Life Technologies, Pleasanton, CA), followed by separation using a 50% Percoll (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA) density gradient. Purity of live hepatocytes was routinely ≥90%. Hepatocytes were cultured in 5% fetal calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) in DMEM supplemented with L-glutamine, antibiotics, insulin-transferrin-selenium, and HEPES (Mediatech, Manassas, VA) and placed either in 6cm collagen-coated TCDs (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) or 10ml RWVs that were high-aspect-ratio-vessels (HARVs) with a diameter of 6cm (Synthecon, Houston, TX). RWV cultures were rotated at 16 rpm to maintain aggregates in suspension. Cells were cultured in 10mls of media at a cell density of 1×105cells/ml for both TCDs and RWVs. Phase contrast photos were taken with a Rebel T3i (Canon, San Jose, CA) adapted to the photoport of the Eclipse TS100 Inverted Microscope (Nikon, Melville, NY). Cell sizes were measured with a stage micrometer. Cell culture supernatants were collected and albumin concentration was determined by a mouse albumin ELISA kit per the manufacturer’s instructions (Bethyl, Montgomery, TX). 2.5. Assay for Cytochrome P450 1a1 Activity EROD (7-ethoxyresorufin-o-dealkylase) assays were performed as previously described [24]. 8μM of 7-ethoxyresorufin (Life Technologies) and 10μM of dicumarol (Sigma) were added to TCD or RWV cultures and incubated for 1 hour in the dark. Culture supernatants were then reacted with 15 Fishman units of β-gluconidase and 120 Roy units of arylsulfatase (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) at 37°C for 2 hours. Conversion of 7-ethoxyresorfin to resorufin was used to quantify CYP1A1 activity by determining the fluorescence optical density at 544nm/590nm (absorption/emission) measured against a standard curve of known amounts of resorufin (Life Technologies). Cells from TCD and RWV cultures were harvested, frozen, and lysed. DNA content was quantified using the Cyquant Assay following the manufacturer’s instructions (Life Technologies). Cell numbers were determined by using a standard curve generated by known numbers of isolated primary mouse hepatocytes. 2.7. Microarray Sample Preparation and Analysis RNA was isolated using RNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Initial RNA integrity was verified by the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Santa Clara, CA). For microarray hybridization, RNA was amplified and biotinylated using the MessageAmp II-Biotin Enhanced Kit per the manufacturer’s instructions (Ambion, Austin, TX). 10μg of biotinylated amplified RNA was hybridized on to the Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) through the UCSF Gladstone Institute Genomics Core (San Francisco, CA). Global gene expression analysis was carried out with GeneSpring GX v. 12.0 software (Agilent) using the GC-RMA summarization algorithm. The expression threshold for analysis was set to raw data greater than the 20thpercentile in at least 2 of the 15 samples. Genes with significant differential expression between any 2 of the 5 conditions were identified by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate multiple testing correction (p-value <0.01) post-hoc Tukey analysis. Complete MIAME (Minimum Information About a Microarray Experiment) –compliant microarray data will be submitted to the Gene Expression Omnibus. 2.9. Quantitative Real-time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) Reverse transcription was carried out with 300ng of RNA using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transciption Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) per the manufacturer’s instructions. One μl of the resulting cDNA was added to a final 20μl mixture containing 10μl of 2x SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and 12 pmol oligonucleotide primers. PCRs were carried out in a 7300 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). The thermal profile was 50°C for 2min, 95°C for 10min, followed by 40 amplification cycles consisting of 95°C for 15s, 63°C for 30s, and 72°C for 30s. Samples were normalized to rRNA 18S internal standard. Relative quantification of gene expression was calculated by using the 2ΔΔCtequation. Two-tailed t-tests were carried out using InStat 3.0 software. Significance was considered when p ≤ 0.05. Data are shown as mean ± standard error (SE) unless otherwise indicated. Statistical analyses for microarray data, including one-way ANOVA, principal components analysis, and hierarchical clustering analysis, were carried out using GeneSpring GX v. 12.0 software. 3.1. Morphology and function of primary mouse hepatocytes cultured within RWVs and on TCDs Hepatocyte 3D aggregates generated in rotating wall vessels (RWVs) demonstrated improved hepatocyte-specific functions compared to monolayers in tissue culture dishes (TCDs). (A) Primary mouse hepatocytes were cultured in either TCDs or RWVs and phase-contrast photomicrographs were taken at 24h and day 3 of culture. Scale bar = 100μm. Total magnification 40x. (B) Albumin production was significantly increased in RWVs at 36h and day 3 of culture compared to TCDs. (C) Likewise, cytochrome P450 1a1 activity was significantly increased in RWVs at 4h, 24h, and day 3 of culture compared to TCDs. Data are representative of 3 independent experiments. *p<0.001. Error bars indicate standard deviation. Primary hepatocytes cultured on TCDs have a slight growth advantage compared to those cultured in RWVs.

Data are representative of 3 independent experiments. Error bars indicate standard deviation. (B) Expression ofPcna(proliferating cell nuclear antigen) in hepatocytes cultured on TCDs was significantly higher than in those cultured in RWV. Data are the average of 5 independent experiments. *p<0.005. Error bars represent standard error. 3.2. Global gene expression profiles of hepatocytes cultured as 3D aggregates or as monolayers To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying improved hepatocyte functions in 3D aggregates, we analyzed the global gene expression of hepatocytes cultured as monolayers on TCDs and 3D aggregates in RWVs at 4 hours and 24 hours using microarrays. These early time-points were chosen to determine the initial gene expression profile of hepatocytes in TCD and RWV cultures. For each of the 5 conditions (freshly isolated hepatocytes, 4h TCD, 4h RWV, 24h TCD, and 24h RWV) we analyzed 3 independent biological samples from separate experiments to ensure experimental reproducibility and increase confidence in the microarray analysis.

Numbers represent the number of genes either distinct in or shared by the 3 processes. 3.3. Gene expression profile of 3D aggregate cultures compared to liver development and liver regeneration One hypothesis for the improved functional capacity of hepatocytes cultured in RWVs as compared to TCDs is that formation of 3D cellular interactions recapitulatedin vivo-like molecular pathways. To test this hypothesis, we compared the genes significantly upregulated in RWV with genes differentially regulated during liver development and liver regeneration. Raw microarray datasets (accession number:GSE6998) of the developing mouse liver and the regenerating mouse liver after two-thirds hepatectomy were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and re-analyzed using the GC-RMA summarization algorithm [27]. Because the same microarray platform was used to generate the curated datasets, re-analyzed data could be directly compared to the microarray data generated in this study. 3.4. Characterization of differential gene expression between 3D aggregate and monolayer cultures Gene ontology analysis of significantly upregulated biological process terms in 3D aggregates as compared to monolayers at 24h of culture. Metabolic and synthetic genes were upregulated in hepatocytes cultured as 3D aggregates in RWVs compared to monolayers in TCDs. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions (qRT-PCR) demonstrated that expression levels of bile acid co-enzyme A (Baat), aldo-ketoreductase 1c19 (Akr1c19), glycogen synthase 2 (Gys2), factor VII (F7), hemochromatosis type 2 (Hfe2), and leptin receptor (Lepr) were significantly upregulated in RWV compared to TCD. Data are the average of 6 independent experiments. *p<0.005, **p<0.0001. Error bars indicate standard error. 3.5. Promoter region analysis of genes upregulated in RWVs compared to TCDs Over-represented transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) in the promoter regions of genes upregulated in RWV culture. Expression ofHnf4awas significantly increased in 3D aggregates in RWVs compared to monolayers in TCDs, as determined by qRT-PCR. Expression levels ofCebpaandFoxa2, two other liver-enriched transcription factors, were not significantly different between the two culture conditions. Data are the average of 6 independent experiments. *p<0.001. Error bars indicate standard error. 3.6. Characterization of mesenchymal and cytoskeletal gene expression in monolayer cultures compared to 3D aggregate cultures Mesenchymal and cytoskeletal genes were upregulated in hepatocytes cultured as monolayers in TCDs compared to 3D aggregates in RWVs. qRT-PCR demonstrated that expression levels of Snail(Snai1), vimentin (Vim), lysyl oxidase-like 2(Loxl2), filamin A (Flna), α1 actin (Acta1), and β-tropomyosin (Tpm2) were significantly upregulated in TCD compared to RWV at 24h of culture. Data are the average of 6 independent experiments. *p<0.05, **p<0.005, ***p<0.001. Error bars indicate standard error. Hnf4a(also known asNr2a1) is a liver-enriched transcription factor and a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily. It can activate gene transcription in the absence of exogenous ligand [43], though it has a hydrophobic binding pocket and linoleic acid may be a potential endogenous ligand [44].Hnf4ais known to have essential roles in normal liver development, maintaining mature liver functions, and in inducing hepatic differentiation in stem cells and fibroblasts. Targeted disruption ofHnf4ain mice led to embryonic lethality due to failure to complete gastrulation [45]. Tetraploid complementation ofHnf4a−/−embryos demonstrated thatHnf4awas essential for hepatocyte differentiation during liver development [46]. Conditional knock-out ofHnf4ain fetal hepatocytes showed thatHnf4awas required for normal morphological and functional differentiation of hepatocytes and development of hepatic epithelium [47]. In addition to its critical role during liver development,Hnf4ais also required to maintain normal metabolic functions of mature hepatocytes. Conditional knock-out ofHnf4ain mature hepatocytes, generated by matingHnf4aloxp/loxpmice with mice expressing Cre under the albumin promoter, showed thatHnf4awas an essential regulator of lipid homeostasis [48], bile acid metabolism [49], glucose metabolism [50], and xenobiotic metabolism [51]. Moreover, ectopic expression ofHnf4ais required for conversion of fibroblasts to hepatocyte-like cells that have mature hepatocyte functions, including the ability to reconstitute liver tissue after transplantation [52]. Over-expression ofHnf4ain human embryonic stem cell and induced pluripotent stem cell derived hepatoblasts was able to significantly improve the mature hepatocyte functions of differentiated cells [53]. Finally, genome-wide studies demonstrated thatHnf4abound the promoters of liver-specific genes significantly more often than other liver-enriched transcription factors [54,55], indicating thatHnf4awas one of the most important transcriptional master regulators of hepatocyte function. Our global gene expression and promoter region analyses indicate thatHnf4aalso plays a central role in maintaining hepatocyte-specific functions in 3D culture. Three-dimensional culture has been shown to improve hepatocyte differentiated functions but the underlying mechanisms of how 3D culture induced these effects were previously unknown. Our data suggest that 3D cell-cell interactions are important for maintaining expression of the master regulatorHnf4aat a higher level compared to monolayer culture. Increased expression ofHnf4ain 3D culture in turn leads to sustained expression of a wide range of downstream hepatocyte-specific functional genes as well as improved overall metabolic function of the hepatocyte. Several gene targets correlating with mature hepatocyte functions significantly upregulated in RWVs are known direct targets ofHnf4a(e.g.Baat,F7, andGys2) [47,49,56] or haveHnf4abinding sites within their promoter regions (e.g.Akr1c19) [57]. There are also functional genes highly upregulated in RWVs that do not possessHnf4aTFBS (e.g.Hfe2andLepr) [57], suggesting thatHnf4amay have an indirect role in controlling expression of these genes or that other transcriptional networks may be involved. Nevertheless, our analyses reveal thatHnf4ais likely the major transcriptional effector for maintaining differentiated functions of hepatocytes in 3D culture. Using global gene expression and promoter region analyses, we demonstrated that the master transcriptional regulatorHnf4ahas a major role in maintaining differentiated hepatocyte functions in 3D culture. Concomitantly, expression of mesenchymal and cytoskeletal genes induced in monolayer cultures were suppressed in 3D aggregates. These findings provide a basis for rational design of biomaterials that aim to optimize hepatocyte-specific functions forin vitroandin vivoapplications.
