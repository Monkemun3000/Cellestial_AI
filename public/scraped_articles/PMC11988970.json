Exploring the role of microgravity in the damage caused by space composite stress has become an important topic in ground-based experiments in recent years [11,12]. Various damages or abnormalities caused by microgravity in the body are collectively referred to as microgravity effects. The microgravity effects are mainly manifested as changes in multiple physiological systems such as the cardiovascular, liver, bone, muscle, nervous, endocrine, and immune systems [13,14,15]. In recent years, researchers have conducted studies on multiple physiological systems related to microgravity, either independently or focusing on some of their interactive effects. However, these studies mainly concentrate on the musculoskeletal and cardiovascular systems, while there are relatively few studies on the liver–brain system, especially on its mechanisms. The liver, as the largest internal organ involved in detoxification and metabolism to maintain the body’s homeostasis, experiences significant gravitational changes. Comparisons between flight specimens and ground controls have shown that among ten types of mouse tissues including muscle, eyes, and kidneys, the liver has the largest number of differentially expressed genes and proteins [16]. As an important detoxification organ for preventing physical injuries caused by space risks, the liver also has a significant impact on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of drugs taken during spaceflight [17,18]. In addition, microgravity exposure can lead to liver dysfunction, resulting in liver injuries and inflammation related to apoptosis and oxidative stress, impaired metabolism, changes in the liver’s exogenous biotransformation mechanism, and lipid deposition [14]. Obviously, these dysfunctions are related to changes in liver metabolism or morphological structure caused by microgravity. Specifically, the major pathophysiological steps involved in these processes are summarized as follows: (1) apoptosis and oxidative stress: microgravity can disrupt the intracellular redox balance, leading to increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [19,20]. Excessive ROS can attack biomacromolecules such as lipids, proteins, and DNA within liver cells, causing oxidative damage. Microgravity also activates apoptotic signaling pathways in liver cells, such as the mitochondrial pathway and the death receptor pathway. In the mitochondrial pathway, microgravity induces changes in mitochondrial membrane permeability, causing cytochrome c to be released into the cytoplasm. This activates caspase-9 and downstream caspase-3, triggering cell apoptosis; (2) inflammatory response: microgravity can induce or exacerbate liver injury by stimulating the release of inflammatory factors and the infiltration of inflammatory cells [21]; (3) metabolic impairment: microgravity affects pathways or enzymes related to glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, and protein metabolism [22], leading to metabolic abnormalities of glucose, lipids, and proteins; (4) changes in the liver’s exogenous biotransformation mechanism: microgravity can influence the expression and activity of drug-metabolizing enzymes (such as the CYP450 enzyme system) in the liver, as well as alter the expression levels of drug transporters (such as P-glycoprotein and organic anion-transporting polypeptides) [23,24]; and (5) lipid deposition: microgravity disrupts the activity of enzymes related to fatty acid metabolism in the liver [25,26], leading to increased fatty acid synthesis and decreased oxidation. Additionally, microgravity affects the expression of genes related to lipoprotein synthesis in the liver, reducing the synthesis and secretion of lipoproteins. Long-term Space Composite Stress in Rats (LSCS) can also trigger depression and cognitive impairments in the body in multiple ways. The possible pathogenic mechanisms remain elusive and poorly understood, involving multiple aspects, including the dysregulation of neural plasticity in astronauts’ brains, decreased levels of neurotransmitters, dysfunction of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, oxidative stress, and abnormal inflammatory responses [27]. Among them, the volume of brain regions, neurotransmitters such as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and dopamine (DA) in the hippocampus, and antioxidant capacity are greatly affected by spaceflight. These physiological indicators with abnormal changes have become the targets for studying the pathogenesis of cognitive impairments [28,29,30]. Besides other factors such as space radiation, isolation and confinement, and circadian rhythm disorders, increasing evidence suggests that microgravity itself can affect the brain through multiple mechanisms, including vestibular deprivation, weightlessness, and cerebrospinal fluid shift [31]. This study is based on the principle of the 3D-Clinostat causing bone loss in mice to establish a new microgravity model in mice, and explores the effects of microgravity on the structure of the gut microbiota and serum metabolites in mice. Combined with the functional prediction of PICRUST 2, behavioral experiments, and a series of physiological and biochemical tests of liver and brain tissues, it has been verified that microgravity changes the structure of the gut microbiota and serum metabolic profile, with abnormal changes in liver and brain tissues. Furthermore, through fecal microbiota transplantation technology, we have also explored the important role of the imbalance of gut microbiota in the abnormal changes in liver and brain tissues caused by microgravity. 2.1.

Similar to the distribution of gut microbiota diversity, we observed that the serum metabolite profiles of the SMG group and the FMT group were essentially overlapping, while being significantly separated from the WT group. The similar microbial community characteristics and serum metabolic profiles between the SMG and FMT groups suggest that microgravity may alter the serum metabolic spectrum by restructuring the gut microbiota of the mice. This finding implies that the changes in the gut microbiota under microgravity conditions could be a key factor in the metabolic shifts observed in the serum, potentially leading to a better understanding of the physiological impacts of microgravity on the organism. 2.6.

Hepatic and Cerebral Metabolic Disorders Induced by Microgravity The findings from gut microbiota and serum metabolomics suggest that microgravity may cause an imbalance in the gut microbiota, leading to disruptions in amino acid and lipid metabolism, and potentially inducing functional damage to the digestive and endocrine systems. The liver, being the primary organ involved in lipid and amino acid metabolism within the digestive system, and the brain, as the central control hub of the nervous and endocrine systems, are of particular interest [43,44]. To verify the hypothesis that microgravity-induced restructuring of the gut microbiota could lead to metabolic disorders in the liver and brain, we examined the morphological structure of the liver and brain in the SMG, FMT, and WT groups of mice using HE staining and magnetic resonance imaging. SMG and FMT induced liver damage and cognitive deficits in mice. (a) HE stained sections of the liver in SMG, FMT, and WT mice.

The data shown are presented as mean ± SD,n= 6, *p< 0.05, **p< 0.01, ***p< 0.001 versus WT group. Changes in physiological and biochemical indexes related to the liver and brain in serum. (a) Changes in blood lipid levels, AST (aspartate aminotransferase), and ALT (alanine aminotransferase) in serum. (b) Changes in the serum HPA axis (corticosterone, cortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone). The data shown are presented as mean ± SD,n= 6. n.s, no significance, *p< 0.05, **p< 0.01, ***p< 0.001 versus WT group. Metabolic disorders and abnormalities in the digestive system are closely related to the liver. In this study, the livers of the model group mice showed diffuse microvesicular/macrovesicular steatosis, inflammation and infiltration of inflammatory cells, as well as abnormalities in antioxidant indicators such as T-AOC (total antioxidant capacity), SOD (superoxide dismutase), CAT (catalase), and GSH-Px (glutathione peroxidase). These changes also frequently appeared in previous studies. Japanese quails that stayed on the Mir orbital station for five days showed a large number of lipid droplet depositions in almost all liver cells of all the flight chicks, and the total amount of lipid droplets was nearly five times higher than that of the ground control chicks [52]. Meanwhile, the accumulation of lipids in the liver led to the consumption of adipocytes in the bone marrow of these flight chicks. Abnormal lipid accumulation was also observed in the livers of all spaceflight mice as measured by Oil Red O staining [53]. Numerous studies have demonstrated that the physiological disorders and pathological development of diseases in organisms are closely related to gut microbiota. Hundreds to thousands of kinds of bacteria colonize in the human intestine, and their quantity is so large that it far exceeds the number of human cells [67]. Gut microbiota mainly colonize in intestinal mucus, the intestinal lumen, and feces, and the number of genes they carry is more than 100 times that of human genes [68]. The changes in human physiological functions are closely associated with the intestinal microbial community. The mutually beneficial intestinal microbial ecology is of great importance for the homeostasis of metabolism and the liver–brain system [69,70]. Intestinal microorganisms play a role in metabolic regulation, intestinal peristalsis and barrier homeostasis, nutrient absorption, and neural signal transduction [71]. The relationship between the host and microorganisms is complex, and when an imbalance occurs, it may lead to abnormalities in the body’s systems. We have found that compared with the control group, the model group and the fecal microbiota transplantation group of mice exhibited gut physiological abnormalities (intestinal structure and tissue cytokines), fecal abnormalities, and gut microbiota imbalance under conditions of liver–brain metabolic disorders and functional abnormalities. The damage and inflammatory response in the colonic tissue of the SMG group mice suggest the disruption of the intestinal barrier and an abnormal physiological environment. This may directly affect the stability of the gut microbiota [72]. The group’s yellowish and soft feces further confirm this point [73]. Furthermore, we have discussed the common differential gut microbiota of the model group mice and the FMT group mice relative to the WT group. It was found that the imbalanced gut microbiota was found to be related to liver–brain abnormalities in functional prediction. This may be because microgravity affects the terminal metabolism of mice by reconstructing gut microbiota, thus inducing liver–brain abnormalities. Studies suggest that microgravity stress can change the physiological environment of the intestine and also have an impact on the virulence of intestinal bacteria and their resistance to antibiotics. Microgravity, low fluid shear, and microgravity-related dynamics have been proved to play a role in microbial gene expression, physiology, and pathogenesis [74]. In order to explore the possible relationships among metabolite changes, gut microbiota alterations, and apparent liver–brain metabolic disorders under microgravity stress, this study used MetaMapp (version 2.0.1 45) to analyze the interactions between different metabolites and screen for key metabolites in the stress response of mice induced by microgravity at the metabolic level. MetaMapp is a tool for metabolomics data analysis and visualization. Its main function is to construct a network map of metabolites by integrating chemical similarity and mass spectral similarity matrices, as well as the KEGG reaction database [75]. It helps researchers map metabolomics data to biochemical modules, aiding biological interpretation. The network maps generated by MetaMapp clearly show the relationships and interactions among metabolites, which is very helpful for understanding complex metabolic networks. Moreover, MetaMapp does not rely on genomic information, allowing it to independently map and visualize metabolites. This makes it suitable for studying organisms without complete genomic information. Vancomycin (50 mg/kg), Neomycin (100 mg/kg), Metronidazole (100 mg/kg), Ampicillin (1 mg/mL), and 4% Paraformaldehyde were purchased from Macleans Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Acetonitrile (99.9%), Methanol (99.9%), and Diethyl Ether (99.9%) were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co., Ltd. (St. Louis, MO, USA). Standard compounds of neurotransmitters Serotonin (5-HT), Norepinephrine (NE), Dopamine (DOPA), Acetylcholine (ACH), Glutamate (Glu), and Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA) were obtained from Alfa Aesar Chemical Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). 4.2. Structure and Parameters of the 3D-Clinostat 4.3. Animals Experimental Design C57BL/6 male mice (specific pathogen free, SPF grade, 6 weeks, weighing (20 ± 2)g) and sterilized mouse growth maintenance feed were obtained from Changsheng Biotech (Benxi, China). The brief experimental protocol is as follows. Two batches of mice were sequentially obtained. For the first batch, the mice were randomly divided into two groups (6 mice per group): group 1 (SMG), mice were used to establish a microgravity model and investigate its effects; and group 2 (WT), mice served as a control reference. In the second batch (group 3, FMT), mice underwent fecal microbiota transplantation to replicate the gut microbiota structure of the SMG group, thereby exploring the role of the gut microbiota in microgravity effects. The details are as follows. Mice were housed in a controlled environment at 22 °C with a 12 h light/dark cycle for 1–2 weeks for acclimation, with food and water provided ad libitum. For the establishment of the microgravity simulation model using a 3D-Clinostat, after two weeks of acclimation, the first batch of mice underwent a one-week adaptation training on the clinostat (6 h of rotation on the first day, followed by 18 h of rest; 12 h of rotation for the second and third days, with 12 h of rest; 24 h of rotation on the fourth day, and a rest day on the fifth; and another 24 h of rotation on the sixth day, with a rest day on the seventh). On the eighth day (denoted as Day 1), the mice were randomly divided into two groups (n= 6): the 3D-Clinostat group with 3D-printed mouse survival boxes (Patent No.: ZL202022855659.9) and the WT group with 3D-printed mouse survival boxes only, labeled as SMG (Simulated Microgravity) and WT (Wild Type), respectively. The SMG group underwent a 42-day rotation treatment. During this period, both groups were fed with solid agar and normal growth maintenance feed (with water and food separated inside the survival boxes), and daily weight, water, and food intake were recorded. The water and food were replaced regularly, and the survival boxes were cleaned to ensure a comfortable living environment for the mice. After the 42 days of rotation, fecal samples were collected from both groups. Some samples were directly stored at −80 °C for 16S sequencing after morphological observation, and others were stored with 30% glycerol at −80 °C for subsequent FMT. The learning and memory capabilities of the mice were assessed using the Barnes maze and Y-maze tests. Subsequently, small animal magnetic resonance imaging was used to scan the brains of both groups to observe any differences in brain region volume and morphology between SMG and WT mice. After dissection, bilateral femurs were collected for length and weight measurement. Micro-CT and HE staining were then used to observe the morphology of the mouse femur tissue to confirm the success of the microgravity simulation. Intestinal, liver, serum, and brain samples from both groups were collected for further testing. For the establishment of the pseudo-germ-free mouse model induced by a mixture of antibiotics, we referred to the studies of Hoedt EC, Hueston CM, Cash N, et al. [85]. In brief, six mice after one week of acclimation were intragastrically administered a mixture of vancomycin (50 mg/kg), neomycin (100 mg/kg), and metronidazole (100 mg/kg) every 12 h, with a gavage volume of 10 mL/kg; ampicillin (1 mg/mL) was also added to the drinking water. This intervention was continued, and mouse feces were collected daily for anaerobic culture counts. On the seventh day, we found that the total number of viable bacteria in the feces was less than 1 CFU/mg, indicating the successful establishment of germ-free mice. After the pseudo-germ-free mice underwent the same adaptation training as before, they were housed in 3D-printed mouse survival boxes without simulated microgravity treatment for 42 days. During this period, the feces from the SMG group were used to intragastrically administer the pseudo-germ-free mice twice every seven days. After 42 days, the group was labeled as the FMT (Fecal Microbiota Transplantation) group. Feces were collected as before, and the mice’s learning and memory abilities were assessed. The mice were then dissected, and their livers, serum, and brains were collected for subsequent tests. All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Harbin Institute of Technology (Approval Number: IACUC-2023003, 15 February 2023; IACUC-2024141, 10 December 2024) and conducted in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The right femurs of mice fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde were scanned using a Micro-CT scanner (Quantum GX2, PerkinElmer, Berlin, Germany) with appropriate scanning parameters. The scanning parameters were set as follows: voltage at 85 kV, current at 200 μA, and exposure time at 384 ms. The images were reconstructed using GPU NRecon Server V1.7.4.2 software. Microstructural analysis of the bone was conducted on a region located 0.5 mm above the growth plate in the metaphysis of the distal femur, with a width of 0.5 mm. This analysis provides insights into the bone’s microarchitecture, which is crucial for understanding the effects of microgravity simulation on bone tissue. 4.5. Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) equipment used was a small animal MRI scanner from the Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. After anesthetizing the mice with 5% isoflurane to stabilize their condition, scans were conducted. A three-dimensional T2-weighted imaging with a rapid acquisition and relaxation enhancement (RARE) sequence was employed to acquire structural images with the following parameters: repetition time (TR) of 1800 ms, echo time (TE) of 45 ms, a flip angle of 90°, a sampling matrix of 256 × 256, voxel size of 0.078 mm × 0.078 mm × 0.512 mm, 32 slices, and slice thickness/spacing of 0.512/0 mm. The images, originally in DICOM format, were converted to NIFTI format. ITKSNAP 3.6.0 and MATLAB R2022a (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) software were utilized to automatically and manually remove the mouse brain scalp. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis was performed using SPM 8.3.2.0 in conjunction with MATLAB software. 4.6. Behavioral Experiments (Barnes Maze and Y-Maze) 4.7. Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE) Staining 4.8. Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISA) Inflammation-related cytokines in colonic tissue, including IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6, as well as the levels of serum ATCH, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL), were measured using corresponding enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (Institute of Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering, Nanjing, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 4.9. Detection of Lipid Levels, Liver Function, and Antioxidant Capacity in Liver and Brain The serum levels of total cholesterol (TC) and triglycerides (TG), as well as the activities of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in both serum and liver, were measured using commercial diagnostic kits (Institute of Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering, China) according to the instructions. The total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and malondialdehyde (MDA) in liver and brain tissues were also analyzed with the respective commercial diagnostic kits. 4.10. Detection of Neurotransmitters and Corticosteroids Mouse brain tissue samples (20 mg) were washed with sterile saline. Deionized water (200 μL) and a mixture of acetonitrile–methanol solution (800 μL) were added to the brain tissue samples. The mixture was sonicated at 4 °C, then vortexed and quickly frozen with liquid nitrogen. The mixture was allowed to return to 25 °C, and the process was repeated three times to obtain a homogenate of brain tissue. The contents of representative neurotransmitters such as serotonin (5-HT), norepinephrine (NE), dopamine (DOPA), acetylcholine (ACH), glutamate (Glu), and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain tissue homogenate were detected using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS). The treatment method and testing conditions were referenced from the literature [90]. The expression levels of cortisol and corticosterone in serum were also measured by LC–MS. Briefly, diethyl ether (500 μL) was added to the serum samples (800 μL) and rotated for 5 min. After centrifugation at 10,000 rpm, the upper organic phase was collected, and the process was repeated once more. The product was dried with nitrogen gas and then dissolved in methanol (200 μL), vortexed for 3 min, and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant (100 μL) was used for LC–MS detection. Reference standards for these substances were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Corporation (St. Louis, MO, USA). 4.11. DNA Extraction and 16S rDNA Sequencing 4.12. Serum Untargeted Metabolomics Analysis Serum metabolites were extracted using a mixture of methanol and acetonitrile (2/1,v/v) by ultrasonication. After centrifugation, the supernatant was filtered and used for liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) analysis. A Dionex Ultimate 3000 RS UHPLC system coupled with a Q-Exactive quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer equipped with a heated electrospray ionization (ESI) source (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was utilized to analyze the metabolic profiling in both positive and negative ESI modes. An ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 column (1.7 μm, 2.1 × 100 mm) was employed for both positive and negative modes. Metabolites were identified using Progenesis QI 2.0 (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA) Data Processing Software, based on public databases such as the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) and LIPID MAPS, as well as self-built databases. Principle component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least-squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) were performed to visualize the metabolic alterations among experimental groups after mean centering (Ctr) and Pareto variance (Par) scaling, respectively. The Hotelling’s T2 region, depicted as an ellipse in the score plots of the models, defines the 95% confidence interval of the modeled variation. Variable importance in the projection (VIP) assesses the overall contribution of each variable to the OPLS-DA model, with variables having VIP > 1 considered relevant for group discrimination. In this study, a default 7-round cross-validation was applied, excluding 1/seventh of the samples from the mathematical model in each round to prevent overfitting. The positive and negative data were combined to obtain a comprehensive dataset. Differential metabolites were selected based on a statistically significant threshold of variable influence on projection (VIP) values from the OPLS-DA model andpvalues from a two-tailed Student’st-test on the normalized peak areas. Metabolites with VIP values > 1.0 andpvalues < 0.05 were considered differential metabolites. Metabolite classification and functional analysis were completed using MetaboAnalyst 6.0 and the KEGG database. All data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) and were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 8.0 software (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). Differences between groups for 16S data were assessed using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, while metabolic profiling data and physiological parameter data were evaluated using a two-tailed, unpaired Student’st-test. Ap-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Overall, in this study, the 3D-Clinostat was used to conduct ground simulation of the microgravity effect on mice. It was found that the number of trabeculae in the femoral tissues of mice was significantly reduced and osteoporosis was evident. The obvious osteoporotic state of the mouse femur indicated the successful establishment of the mouse microgravity model. Subsequently, based on the 16S data detection of the feces of the model group mice, it was discovered that microgravity reconstructed the gut microbiota of mice. Based on the functional enrichment analysis of the microbiota, it was found that microgravity might impair the functions of lipid metabolism and amino acid metabolism of the body as well as the health of systems including the intestine, liver, and brain. Then, through fecal microbiota transplantation, it was found that the serum metabolism of the model group and the FMT group was significantly different from that of the WT group, which was similar to the distribution of gut microbiota diversity data. Thus, the gut microbiota dependence of microgravity-induced metabolic disorders was determined, indicating that microgravity affects the terminal metabolism of mice by reconstructing gut microbiota. Based on the functional analysis of the gut microbiota and serum metabolome of mice, we supposed that the reconstruction of gut microbiota induced by microgravity would lead to abnormal metabolism in the liver and brain tissues of the body. Finally, based on the serum metabolome data, the oxidation indicators of the brain and liver tissues and serum of the model group mice, as well as the detection of behavioral memory ability and neurotransmitters, it was verified that the reconstruction of gut microbiota induced by microgravity would lead to metabolic imbalance and functional abnormalities in the liver and brain tissues of the body.
