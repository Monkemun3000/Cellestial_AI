Although leptin played an important role in the abnormal skeletal bone growth, leptin was a multiple-effect hormone, affecting energy metabolism, appetite, thermogenesis, immune system, and neuroendocrine (14,15), each of which could independently determine the growth pattern of skeletal bone longitudinal growth (16). Leptin is responsible for the secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone, and leptin deficiency directly leads to a reduced level of estrogen in ob/ob mice (17). Estrogen and its receptor (ERα and ERβ) signaling pathway played an essential role in skeletal growth, and the absence of estrogen in rats presented an accelerated bone elongation as compared with that in normal female rats (18,19). Effects of different ERs (α and β) on the axial and appendicular bone elongation were distinct, which were proved by ER knock-out mice. ERα knock-out mice showed a decreasing bone growth, while mice with inactivation of ERβ had increased appendicular bone growth (20–22). Our previous study also showed that blocking different ERs presented opposite effects on the appendicular longitudinal growth (23). Recently, a crosstalk effect between leptin and ERs in the endochondral bone formation has been reported in our previous study (24), and a stage-specific effect of leptin on the ER expression was obvious during the hypertrophic differentiation stage in a model of chondrocyte differentiationin vitro(25). The integration of estrogen and leptin signaling, which is responsible for contrasting growth patterns in appendicular and axial longitudinal growthviaERs, is still unknown. Therefore, we hypothesize that leptin deficiency may influence the ER expression in axial and appendicular GPin vivo, contributing to the contrasting phenotypes of skeletal growth in ob/ob mice. The current study was designed to determine the role of ERs in the skeletal longitudinal growth of leptin deficiency mice. We examine the femur and spinal GP using densitometric, histomorphometric, and immunohistochemical techniques to expand our current understanding of how the absence of leptin affects axial and appendicular growth. In total, 24 C57BL/6 mice and 24 ob/ob mice were purchased from GemPharmatech Co., Ltd. (Jiangsu, China) and were randomly divided into eight groups. In the first stage, C57BL/6 was used as WT (n = 6), ob/ob mouse was used as ob/ob (n = 6). These two groups of mice did not receive any drug treatment and were euthanized for tissue collection. In order to determine the role of ERs in skeletal growth of ob/ob mice, the second stage was performed as follows: WT, ob/ob control (ob/ob + ctrl), ob/ob mice treated with methyl-piperidino-pyrazole, an ERα-selective antagonist (ob/ob + MPP), and ob/ob mice were treated with 4-(2-phenyl-5,7-bis(trifluoromethyl)pyrazolo(1,5-a)pyrimidin-3-yl)phenol, an ERβ-selective antagonist (ob/ob + PHTPP). After 1 week of adaptive feeding, mice were treated with different kinds of ER antagonists during the puberty of female mice (4 to 10 weeks). The control group ob/ob mice were subcutaneously injected with 100 μl of saline solution. The MPP group mice and PHTPP group mice were intraperitoneally injected with MPP [0.3 mg/kg/day, dissolved in 1‰ dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)] and PHTPP (0.3 mg/kg/day, dissolved in 1‰ DMSO), respectively, according to previous studies (23,26). All the groups received injections at 5 days/week for 6 weeks. The body weight of each mouse was recorded every week. At the end of each stage, X-ray radiography (Shanghai United Imaging Healthcare Co., Ltd. Shanghai, China) was used to get the images of all mice, which were in the prone position. Femur length and spine (L1–L6) length were quantified using ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD). The femur length was recorded as appendicular length, and the spine length was recorded as axial length. Tissue Sample Length Measurements and Collection After euthanasia, the femur and lumbar L5 vertebrae were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for at least 24 h. Ten percent ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) was used for decalcification of these bone tissues for at least 3 weeks. After decalcification, the femur and spine were embedded in paraffin for future histological analysis. Quantitative Histology of Axial and Appendicular Growth Plate Using H&E Staining H&E staining and the quantitative analysis of GP were performed according to previous studies (23). Briefly, 4-μm-thick two nonconsecutive sections were made from paraffin of femur and lumbar (L5 vertebrae) tissues of each mouse and were then deparaffinized with xylene, followed by staining with H&E according to the manual protocol. The quantitative analysis was carried out by measuring the GP under the ×10 magnification using Nikon Eclipse microscope (Nikon, Japan). The height of GP was recorded by the mean values of 20 measurements per section. Furthermore, the height of the proliferative and hypertrophic zones was analyzed by 20 columns in each section and was recorded as an average. ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD) was used to measure the height of the femur and lumbar GP height in a blind method. TUNEL Assay (Apoptosis Analysis) The TUNEL assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Roche, USA). Briefly, the apoptotic GP cells were identified by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated deoxy UTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) IHC. The DAB method was used to detect the staining. The positive cells were counted within the GP and presented as a percentage of the total cells. Quantification of Immunohistochemistry Staining Femur Growth Plate Harvest and RNA Extraction The distal femur or vertebrae were median incised using a surgical blade, and the GP can be seen under the field of a microscope. Micro-forcep was used to harvest the GP tissue. The harvested GP tissues were immediately placed in TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies). A homogenizer was used to make the homogenized GP. Then, the total RNA was extracted according to our previous studies (23,25). NanoDrop spectrophotometer was used to quantify RNA, and 0. 5 μg was reverse transcribed into cDNA. Gene expression was evaluated by qPCR using a Roche LightCycler®480II (Roche Diagnostics). PCR amplification was performed with TB green premix Ex Taq (Takara) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The forward and reverse primer sequences were as follows: ERα: 5′-CCTCCCGCCTTCTACAGGT-3′ and 5′-CACACGGCACAGTAGCGAG-3′; ERβ: 5′-CTGTGCCTCTTCTCACAAGGA-3′ and 5′-TGCTCCAAGGGTAGGATGGAC-3′; β-actin: 5′-GGCTGTATTCCCCTCCATCG-3′ and 5′-CCAGTTGGTAACAATGCCATGT-3′. The progress of qPCR contained two steps: first, an initial 30 s of heating to 95°C and then 20 cycles consisting of 5 s at 95°C followed by 20 s at 60°C. The ΔΔCt method was used to evaluate the transcript levels, and data were normalized for input based on β-actin and expressed relative to mice in the control group. The distal femur or vertebrae were median incised using a surgical blade, and the GP can be seen under the field of a microscope. All GP tissues were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (Beyotime, Jiangsu, China), and the protein concentration was analyzed using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) kit (Beyotime, Jiangsu, China). The tissue lysates (35 μg) were separated by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) using electrophoresis, and then the proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane. After being blocked with 5% non-fat milk for 1 h, the membranes were incubated with primary anti-ERα (1:1,000, affinity, USA, Catalog No. AF6058), anti-ERβ (1:1,000, affinity, USA, Catalog No. AF6469), and GAPDH (1:5,000, ProteinTech, China, Catalog No. 10494-1-AP) at 4°C overnight. After being washed thrice with PBS, the membranes were incubated with an appropriate secondary antibody. Finally, the membranes were determined by Bio-Rad ChemiDoc (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., USA) and were quantified by ImageJ software. At the end of mice’s puberty, X-ray was performed to collect images of the femur and lumbar spine. As shown inFigure 1, the femur of ob/ob mice was shorter than that of WT mice, and the lumbar length of ob/ob mice was longer than that of WT mice, which suggested that leptin deficiency mice had the contrasting phenotypes between femoral and lumbar spinal growth compared with those of WT mice. H&E staining of femoral and vertebral sections was used to investigate the thickness of GP in WT mice and ob/ob mice. The body weight (Figure 1D) of ob/ob mice was higher than that of WT mice at the beginning of the experiment (4-week-old mice), which was in line with the phenotype of obese ob/ob mice. The femur GP height of ob/ob mice was thinner than that of WT mice (Figures 2A, B), while the spinal GP of ob/ob mice was thicker than that of WT mice (Figures 2F, G). Additional histological analysis for the proliferative zone and hypertrophic zone of femur GP showed that both zones were decreased in the ob/ob mice compared with WT mice (Figure 2C), while the ratio of hypertrophic/proliferative zone of femoral GP was higher in ob/ob mice than in WT mice (Figures 2D, E). Located at the spinal GP, the proliferative zone in ob/ob mice was thicker than that of WT mice. However, there was no difference in the hypertrophic/proliferative zone ratio between ob/ob and WT mice (Figures 2G–J).

During the terminal differentiation procedure, GP hypertrophic chondrocytes undergo apoptosis with calcification of cartilaginous matrix followed by deposition of new bone. The positive number of TUNEL (+) chondrocytes at the hypertrophic zone were evaluated using a percentage of the total number of cells in the hypertrophic zone. At the end of our experiment (12-week-old WT mice), the mean percentage of apoptotic TUNEL-positive cells among the femur GP hypertrophic chondrocytes was 14.38 (Figure 3A). However, in 12-week-old ob/ob control mice, the percentage of apoptotic vertebral GP chondrocytes in the hypertrophic zone was greater (35.1%). The apoptosis rate in the vertebral GP chondrocytes of ob/ob mice was lower than that of WT mice (Figure 3B).

In conclusion, we found that leptin deficiency presented contrasting phenotypes in axial and appendicular growth of ob/ob mice at the end of puberty, with reduced level of proliferative and hypertrophic markers in femoral GP and an increased level of these markers in spinal GP. Furthermore, we first found a significant change of expression of ERα located at femoral and spinal GP (lower in femoral GP and higher in spinal GP as compared with that in WT mice). These findings suggested that region-specific expression of ERα might be associated with the formation of contrasting phenotypes of axial and appendicular bone growth in the ob/ob mice. However, further studies are needed to clarify the relation between ERs and leptin in regulating endochondral ossification.
