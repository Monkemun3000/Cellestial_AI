E-mail:mdelp@ufl.edu Received 2012 Oct 24; Accepted 2013 Feb 11. Approximately 29% of astronauts on short-term (∼2 wk) space shuttle flights and 60% on long-duration (∼6 mo) missions to the International Space Station (ISS) are reported to have experienced some impairment in distant or near visual acuity (1). These visual disturbances have been hypothesized to be related to increases in intracranial pressure (1–3). An increase in intracranial pressure associated with spaceflight could occur through several mechanisms, including the movement of arterial, venous, and cerebrospinal fluids toward the head due to the loss of the head-to-foot gravity vector present on Earth. However, given autoregulatory mechanisms that prevent cerebral perfusion from increasing in the presence of elevations in arterial perfusion pressure (4,5), a putative rise in cerebral arterial pressure (Pa) of 20–30 mmHg in a microgravity environment (6) would not be expected to increase cerebral blood flow (CBF) and, correspondingly, fluid filtration into the cranium to drive elevations in intracranial pressure. Ground-based animal studies in rats subjected to chronic head-down tail suspension (HDT) have been conducted to simulate the cephalad fluid shift (7–10) and general cardiovascular deconditioning (11,12) that occurs with spaceflight. In the HDT animal model, elevations inPato the head result in decreases in CBF (13,14), increases in the intrinsic vasoconstrictor responsiveness of cerebral arteries (14–18), and remodeling of the cerebral arterial vasculature that is characterized by the thickening of the medial smooth muscle cell layer and, in some cerebral arteries, a decrease in maximal intraluminal diameter (14,16,19,20). Experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and conformed to the U.S. National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH Publication no. 85-23, revised 1996). The present study was performed as part of a larger study in which 9-wk-old female C57BL/6 mice were divided into 4 groups: SF-vehicle (n=15), SF-treatment (n=15), GC-vehicle (n=15), and GC-treatment (n=15) mice. One day before flight, all mice received a subcutaneous injection (0.01 ml/g body mass) in the vicinity of the hip of either an A5SuT buffer solution (vehicle) or a sclerostin antibody (treatment). SF mice were flown for 13 d on the STS-135 space shuttle mission. Through a NASA Biospecimen Sharing Program (BSP), the current study was to be conducted only on SF-vehicle (n=15) and GC-vehicle (n=15) mice. However, on the day after experiments with SF mice were concluded, it was discovered that both SF-vehicle (n=7) and SF-treatment (n=8) mice were mistakenly passed to BSP investigators, so only data from the 7 SF-vehicle animals are reported herein. SF-vehicle and SF-treatment mice were interspersed with each other at the time of death, so the time frame over which SF-vehicle studies were conducted was similar to the timeframe over which the GC-vehicle experiments were completed. SF mice were housed in NASA's animal enclosure modules (AEMs) located on the orbiter's middeck, maintained on a 12-h light-dark cycle, and provided food (21) and waterad libitum. Age-matched GC mice were housed in identical AEMs within an orbital environment simulator at Kennedy Space Center (KSC; FL, USA) to replicate the temperature, humidity, and partial pressure of CO2on the space shuttle middeck. GC animals were maintained under these conditions beginning 48 h after launch and ending 48 h after landing. All experimental procedures conducted on SF animals were duplicated on GC animals. The KSC veterinarian deemed all animals healthy before SF and GC experiments. A different group of 16-wk-old male C57BL/6J mice from a separate project were housed at NASA Ames Research Center (Mountain View, CA, USA), maintained on a 12-h light-dark cycle, and provided food and waterad libitum. Mice were randomly assigned to either a cage control (CON;n=5) or 16 d HDT group (n=5). The HDT treatment, which was carried out as described previously in rats and mice (14,20,22), induces an array of cardiovascular changes that occur in astronauts after return from space, including resting tachycardia (22,23), hypotension (14), and decreased aerobic exercise capacity (11,12,22). For the shuttle flight study, tissue dissection procedures commenced ∼3–4 h after landing. Animals were anesthetized through isoflurane inhalation and euthanizedviacardiac puncture and exsanguination. The brain was rapidly removed and placed in a 4°C physiological saline solution (PSS). Basilar and posterior communicating arteries (PCAs) were then dissected from the brain using a stereomicroscope (Olympus SZX12; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan), placed in PSS on ice, and transported in a staggered fashion from KSC to the University of Florida campus in Gainesville, FL (∼3 h drive). Basilar arteries were used forin vitroexperimentation to determine myogenic vasoconstrictor properties, passive pressure-diameter characteristics and gross vascular structure. PCAs were used to determine vascular tissue mechanics using a nanoindentation methodology. For the HDT study, animals were anesthetized through isoflurane anesthesia and killed by thoracotomy; the brain was rapidly removed and placed in 4°C PSS. The basilar artery was dissected from the brain forin vitroexperimentation to determine myogenic vasoconstrictor properties, passive pressure-diameter characteristics, and gross vascular structure. Basilar arteries were transferred to a Lucite chamber containing PSS, cannulated at each end with glass micropipettes, and securedvia11-0 ophthalmic suture (Alcon Laboratories, Fort Worth, TX, USA). After cannulation, the isolated vessel tissue chamber was transferred to the stage of an inverted microscope (Olympus IX70) interfaced in series with a video camera (Panasonic BG310; Panasonic, Osaka, Japan), a horizontal video caliper (307A; Colorado Video, Boulder, CO, USA), a data-acquisition system (Powerlab; ADInstruments, Colorado Springs, CO, USA), and a video monitor (Panasonic WV-BM1410). Intraluminal pressure was set at 100 cmH2O (74 mmHg; ref.24) provided by way of 2 independent PSS-filled reservoirs connected to the glass micropipettes, and the distance between the cannulating micropipettes was adjusted so that the vessel axial length was straight but not stretched. Basilar arteries were equilibrated for 60 min at 37°C in PSS, which was replaced every 15 min during the equilibration period and throughout the experimental procedures. Intraluminal diameters were continuously measuredviavideomicroscopic techniques (14,19). To evaluate myogenic vasoconstriction, intraluminal pressure was lowered to 0 cmH2O for 5 min and then increased from 0–140 cmH2O in increments of 20 cmH2O every 5 min by raising both PSS-fluid reservoirs simultaneously so that all pressure changes occurred in the absence of intraluminal flow. Arteries were then incubated for 30 min in Ca2+-free PSS at an intraluminal pressure of 100 cmH2O. A bolus dose of sodium nitroprusside (SNP; 10−4M; refs.25,26) was added during the second 15-min incubation in Ca2+-free PSS to ensure complete vascular smooth muscle relaxation. Maximal intraluminal diameter and medial wall thickness were determined at the end of the second 15-min incubation in Ca2+-free PSS at 100 cmH2O. Medial wall thickness was taken as the mean of 3 separate wall thickness measurements from positions randomly selected along the microvessel length. To measure medial wall thickness, the video caliper used to measure intraluminal diameter was positioned on the far right or far left side of the vessel. The focal plane was adjusted through the medial wall, and the smallest distance between the inner and outer medial surface was taken to be medial wall thickness. Finally, a passive pressure-diameter relation was determined using identical procedures to those used for the active myogenic response described above, except that the arteries were maintained in Ca2+-free PSS containing 10−4M SNP. Nanoindentation of all PCA samples occurred within 23 h of the vessels being dissected from the brain. Before the indentation procedure, the samples equilibrated for 30 min at 25°C in PSS.

Adhesion to the microscope slide allowed the sample to lie flat as shown. All samples were translucent in appearance, and had uniform texture as observed by visual inspection. Indents were made ≥100 μm from the edges of the sample.

Indentation testing was performed with the sample submerged in PSS.C) Optical microscope image of the sample in the reservoir. Nanoindentation was performed using a TriboIndenter (Hysitron, Minneapolis, MN, USA) with a laboratory noise floor displacement resolution of 1 nm, and force resolution of 100 nN (Fig. 3A). The transducer utilizes a 3-plate capacitor, with the indenter tip attached to the middle plate. As such, the displacement of the tip (actuation of the middle plate in regard to the outer plates) is quantified by changes in capacitance. The generated force (electrostatic actuation) is measured through the displacement of a spring with a known calibrated stiffness (U.S. National Institutes of Standards and Technology traceable), which acts in accordance with Hooke's law. Force and displacement are regulated by electronic control and continuously measured during each indentation. A) Photograph of nanoindenter showing transducer that actuates the diamond tip.

A nominal 100-μm-radius diamond conospherical fluid cell tip (AA03171104; Hysitron;Fig. 3B,C) was used, as its radius is appropriate for soft samples (∼kPa range). Accordingly, the tip is designed such that there is a minimization of stress concentration, enabling measurement within the linear stress-stain limit (elastic region) of the material (27). The microscope slide with sample was attached to an aluminum block (6×4×2 cm)viaadhesive discs (Lift-N-Press; SPI Supplies, West Chester, PA, USA) and loaded into the nanoindentation system. The sample was located using anin situoptical microscope. The TriboIndenter was calibrated to allow indentation at the position identified using the optical microscope. Indents were made in the displacement-control mode of the instrument with a maximum displacement of 4000 nm. A trapezoidal displacement cycle was used with a loading rate of 400 nm/s to maximum displacement, followed by a 5-s hold, followed by an unloading rate of 400 nm/s. All indentations were performed at 25°C with the sample submerged in PSS. The surface of the sample was identified when the tip detected a 7 μN force after passing through the air and the fluid above. Then, a preliminary 500-nm maximum displacement indentation was performed. The force-displacement response was observed to ensure that the tip was in contact with the sample surface. Next, the indenter tip was lifted from the sample surface 2 μm, and the indentation used for measurement of the sample's properties was performed. This surface detection and indentation procedure was repeated 5 times with indents spanning the length of the sample at a spacing of 10–100 μm. A total of 21 samples from GC (n=14) and SF (n=7) mice were tested. To avoid cross contamination, the indenter tip was gently cleansed with an acetone-soaked (99.8%) cotton swab between testing of each sample. PSS contained (in mM) 145 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 1.2 NaH2PO4, 1.17 MgSO4, 2.0 CaCl2, 5.0 glucose, 2.0 pyruvate, 0.025 EDTA, and 3.0 MOPS, pH 7.4. PSS was supplemented with bovine serum albumin (BSA; 1 g/100 ml; USB Corp., Cleveland, OH, USA) and passed through a 0.22-μm cellulose acetate filter (430015; Corning, Corning, NY, USA). Ca2+-free PSS buffer preparation was identical except for the addition of 2 mM EDTA, the replacement of CaCl2with 2.0 mM NaCl, and the exclusion of BSA. A5SuT buffer solution contained 10 mM sodium acetate, 9% sucrose, and 0.004% Tween 20, pH 5. The development of spontaneous tone was expressed as the percentage of constriction relative to maximal diameter and was calculated as follows: where IDmaxis the maximal inner diameter recorded at a pressure of 100 cmH2O, and IDBis the starting baseline diameter. The effective elastic modulus (Er) of each indent was measured by the method of Oliver and Pharr (28). The method utilizes hertzian elastic contact mechanics with modifications by Sneddon (29) for various rigid punch geometries. The method assumes isotropic and homogeneous elastic or elastic-inelastic behavior of the sample material. The effective elastic modulus is given by: whereSis the measured contact stiffness determined from the derivative (slope) of the unloading portion of the load-displacement curve (Fig. 3D), andAcis the contact area at maximum force. Contact stiffness was calculated from the slope of the loading portion of the load-displacement curve (Fig. 3D). This adaptation was suitable due to the absence of inelasticity in the samples. It also minimizes errors encountered on unloading due to adhesion between the tip and sample. IGOR Pro (WaveMetrics, Portland, OR, USA) data analysis software was used to determine the effective elastic modulus for each indent. A power law fit was applied to the loading curve, and the derivative was calculated to determine the contact stiffness. The contact area, as a function of indenter displacement (h), was calculated based on the known geometry of the spherical tip with a radius (R) of 100 μm: The means ±seof the effective elastic modulus of indents for each sample were calculated. Active myogenic and passive pressure-response curves were evaluated by using 2-way repeated-measures ANOVA to detect differences between (SFvs.GC or HDTvs.CON) and within (pressure) factors.Post hocanalyses were performed with Bonferroni's test for pair-wise comparisons where appropriate. Student's unpairedttests were used to determine whether differences in developed spontaneous tone, maximal diameter, medial wall thickness, elastic modulus, stiffness, soleus muscle mass, and body mass were significant between groups. All values are presented as means ±se. A value ofP< 0.05 was used for significance. Preflight body mass (20.7±0.4 g) of SF mice was greater (P<0.05) than postflight body mass (18.4±0.5 g). Likewise, body mass (20.8±0.3 g) of GC mice was greater (P<0.05) pre-vs.post-AEM housing (19.5±0.3 g). There was a tendency for postflight body mass of SF mice to be less than that of GC mice (P=0.09). In a subset of right soleus muscles from GC (n=9) and SF (n=7) animals, soleus muscle mass was lower (P<0.05) in SF than GC mice (SF: 4.7±0.2; GC: 6.0±0.4 mg). Pre-HDT body mass (25.8±0.4 g) was not different from the post-HDT body mass (25.5±0.7 g), and likewise, pretreatment body mass of CON mice (26.4±0.5 g) was not different from that at the end of the study (26.6±0.3 g). Pre- and post-treatment body masses of CON animals were also not different from that of the HDT mice. Soleus muscle mass of the HDT animals (9.2±0.8 mg) was lower (P<0.05) than that from the CON mice (14.3±1.2 mg), thus confirming the efficacy of the elevated hindlimb treatment.

Active and passive pressure-diameter responses Basilar arteries from SF mice were less constricted during incremental increases in transmural pressure than those from GC mice (Fig. 4A).

PCA load-displacement curves from both GC and SF mice have linear loading segments that are indicative of an elastic response. Representative load-displacement curves for GC and SF samples are plotted inFig. 7A. The SF PCA loading segment has a lower slope or stiffness than that of the GC PCA and reaches a maximum force of ∼15 μN. The lower resistance to deformation among SF PCAs resulted in a lower stiffness relative to that of GC PCAs (Fig. 7B). PCAs from both GC and SF mice demonstrated nonlinear unloading behavior (Fig. 7A). The upper 20% of the unloading segment has the highest curvature. The curvature is indicative of adhesion effects between the tip and sample and is quite common in nanoindentation of soft biological samples (30). Also, the adhesion force causes the unloading curve to end at a negative force value rather than returning to 0.

Numerous factors are involved in the regulation of cerebral perfusion (4,5), and many of these factors may be altered in a microgravity environment. As it relates to fluid flow, Ohm's law can be used to estimate the effects of microgravity on brain blood flow according to the equation: where CBF is proportional to thePaand venous pressure (Pv) difference across the brain and is inversely related to the cerebral vascular resistance (CVR) to flow. The loss of the head-to-foot gravity vector normally present on Earth induces a cephalad fluid shift during spaceflight (6). It is believed that this elevatesPato the head by 20–30 mmHg (6), whereas possible increases inPvin the head are less certain, given that direct measures of inflight astronaut centralPvshow a decrease rather than an increase (31). Thus, any possible rise inPvof <20–30 mmHg would indicate an elevation in cerebral perfusion pressure. The cerebral circulation, however, is unique in that intracranial pressure (ICP) will determine the pressure difference across the brain (Pa− ICP) when ICP >Pvin the head. Although the extent to which the loss of the head-to-foot gravity vector will elevate ICP is presently unknown, it seems unlikely that it would exceed the putative 20- to 30-mmHg rise inPain the head. Therefore, the microgravity-induced headward fluid shift should result in either no change or an increase in cerebral perfusion pressure. At present, it is unknown what factors underlie the alterations in mouse cerebral artery function, mechanics, and structure with spaceflight. One factor that has been hypothesized to alter cerebral perfusion and, consequently, intracranial pressure in astronauts is carbon dioxide (CO2; ref.3). CO2is a potent cerebral vasodilator (47–49) and has been shown to interact with cerebral autoregulation to elevate intracranial pressure (50–52). Chronic cerebral artery relaxation during exposure to high levels of CO2could also potentially affect the intrinsic functional and structural properties of cerebral arteries. The space shuttle and ISS are closed environments with nominal CO2levels (2.3 to 5.3 mmHg) well above the ambient partial pressure of CO2(0.23 mmHg) at sea level on Earth (3). Mice from the current study were chronically exposed to these higher levels of CO2on the space shuttleAtlantisduring the STS-135 mission (Fig. 8), and a putative state of chronic relaxation could have contributed to the alterations observed in cerebral arteries. However, high levels of CO2alone cannot account for the alterations in the intrinsic properties of the cerebral arteries from the SF mice, as conditions for GC mice (i.e., temperature, humidity, and partial pressure of CO2) were maintained the same as those occurring on the space shuttle flight deck. The possibility exists that the chronic vasodilator effects of CO2with spaceflight could compromise the integrity of the blood-brain barrier, as has been previously hypothesized (53), and make the cerebral circulation susceptible to the same circulating factors previously considered to only affect the peripheral circulation. For example, in HDT rats, the peripheral arterial circulation shows diminished vasoconstriction regardless of whether it is exposed to higher or lowerPa; diminished vasoconstrictor responsiveness has been reported to occur in carotid arteries (54) and the thoracic aorta (55) wherePais elevated during HDT (7,13), in mesenteric arteries near the hydrostatic indifference point of rats (56,57), and in arterial segments of the lower hindlimb region (54,58) wherePais reduced with HDT (7). Only the cerebral circulation in HDT rats are not likewise affected (14–18). This impairment of peripheral artery vasoconstrictor function, albeit due to unknown factors, is presumed to be a systemic circulating agent, because impairment of smooth muscle contraction also occurs in the venous circulation (57,59), as well as in the lymphatic circulation from the head to the hindlimbs (60). Moreover, peripheral arterial and venous vasoconstrictor impairment has also been previously shown to occur in rats and mice flown on the space shuttle (61–63), including mesenteric veins from the same mice of the present study (61). Therefore, we propose that the chronic vasodilator influence of CO2may compromise the tightness of the junctions between endothelial cells that make up the blood-brain barrier in the cerebral circulation during spaceflight and enable the unknown factors affecting the peripheral circulation to likewise diminish the intrinsic vasoconstrictor responsiveness of cerebral arteries, thereby compromising autoregulation of cerebral perfusion and facilitating elevations in intracranial pressure. Partial pressure of CO2(pCO2) in the space shuttleAtlantisimmediately before and during the STS-135 mission, on whichAtlantisdocked with the ISS. The CO2sensor was located on the orbiter flight deck, located immediately above the middeck where the mice were housed. These studies were originally flown on space shuttle mission STS-107, on which the orbiterColumbiatragically disintegrated during its return flight to Earth. This article is dedicated to the STS-107 crew, who were willing to risk their lives to advance our understanding of the effects of microgravity on human health.
