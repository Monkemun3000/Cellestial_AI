Escherichia coliare versatile bacteria; with the majority being non-pathogenic and considered as commensals. A subset of these bacteria has acquired specific virulence attributes that confer an ability to survive in different niches and cause a broad spectrum of intestinal and extra-intestinal diseases[1],[2]. One of the important aspects of the fitness ofE. coliis thought to be its ability to survive and persist in a variety of environments, including varied anatomical niches, food, soils, poultry litter, and acidic conditions. Extra-intestinal pathogenicE. coli(ExPEC) cause infections outside of their normal intestinal habitat in both mammals and birds, resulting in a considerable economic and public health burden[3],[4]. Major infections associated with ExPEC in humans include urinary tract infections (UTI), newborn meningitis (NBM) and septicemia[4]. In birds, a subgroup of ExPEC, named Avian PathogenicE. coli(APEC), causes a complex of systemic infections, mainly respiratory, often leading to death[4]. The genetic relationship between APEC and other ExPEC of human and animal origin[4]emphasizes the potential zoonotic risk of avian-derivedE. colistrains. In poultry, isolates associated with fecal matter, environmental contamination and chicken meat products possess virulence gene profiles similar to those causing human outbreaks[5],[6], which suggests that retail chicken may be an important reservoir forE. colicausing ExPEC infections in humans. ExPEC exhibit a high degree of antigenic and genetic diversity, which complicates their diagnosis and the design of cross-protective vaccines[7]. ExPEC are defined by a limited number of O-antigens, with specific O antigens being associated with certain clinical syndromes. For example,E. colifrom a small number of O serogroups (O4, O6, O14, O22, O75, and O83) cause 75% of urinary tract infections[8]and a limited number of serotypes, principally O1, O2, O78, O8, and O35, are commonly implicated in avian colibacillosis[9], suggesting that not all O polysaccharides have identical virulence properties[10],[11]. The possession of multiple large plasmids is often a defining feature of ExPEC, especially APEC, in which the virulence is partly plasmid-mediated[12],[13],[14],[15],[16],[17],[18],[19]. Although many studies have been dedicated to understanding the pathogenesis of ExPEC, little is known about the mechanisms of their persistence. Since a correlation between the ecology of bacteria and their virulence exists, understanding the mechanisms of fitness and survival of these bacteria in extreme and changing conditions would not only improve our understanding of their persistence, but also will contribute to better design strategies for their prevention and treatments. aNalr, nalidixic acid resistant; Tcr, tetracycline resistant; Strr, streptomycin resistant; Sxtr, Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole resistant. Genome sequencing has made major contributions to our knowledge of virulence and the evolution of pathogenic bacteria. So far, virulence plasmids associated with ExPEC are ColV, ColBM and Vir plasmids[20]; many of which are already fully sequenced and have been determined as belonging mainly to the IncFIB/FIIA backbone. Although PCR characterization of UPEC and APEC plasmids has revealed the presence of plasmids from other Inc groups[21], studies on their role in ExPEC has been limited. Previously, we examined the role of the three large plasmids of APEC χ7122 in pathogenesis in chickens[12]and sequenced the plasmid pChi7122-1[19]. We were able to assign roles for pChi7122-1 in the virulence in systemic infection of bacteria; however the roles of pChi7122-2 and pChi7122-3 in APEC χ7122 were equivocal. General sequence features of plasmids pChi7122-2, pChi7122-3, and pChi7122-4 ATB, antibiotic; Strr, streptomycin resistant; Sxtr, Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole resistant; -, absent. The different rings represent (from outer to inner) CDS which are color coded by functional group (ring 1 and 2), deviation from average G+C content (ring 3), and GC skew [(G−C)/(G+C); ring 4]. Colors represent the following: red, virulence-associated; green, plasmid transfer; yellow, plasmid replication; grey other functions; brown, hypothetical protein. Our past work has determined that plasmids pChi7122-2 and pChi7122-3 are self-conjugative[12]. Herein, their sequences analysis has revealed the presence of genes required for their transfer (Fig. 1,Table S1andS2). The transfer region of pChi7122-2 is about 34 kb consisting of 24traand 9trbgenes (Table S1) and is identical to the one of the virulence plasmid pAA (FN554767.1; 99% identity with 92% coverage), whereas thetraregion of pChi7122-3 has the same organization as its equivalent inE. coliconjugative plasmid IncI2 R721 (AP002527.1); it contains 11tra/trbgenes, grouped in two clusters separated by twopilgenes (Fig. 1,Table S2). pChi7122-3 also harbors genesnikB,nikC, andnikAfor relaxome formation involved in plasmid transfer[22],[23](Fig. 1,Table S2). Among the three plasmids, only pChi7122-2 carries antibiotic resistance genes (MM2-101, MM2-102 and MM2-103) (Table S1). These genes encode for a dihydropteroate synthase (sul1)[24], a GCN5-related N-acetyl transferase[25]and a streptomycin 3′-adenylytransferase(SP-R) (aadA)[26], respectively. The phenotypic expression of streptomycin and sulfonamide (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) resistance in strains containing pChi7122-2 has been determined by disk diffusion tests. Although streptomycin has only limited current usage in clinical medicine, it remains important for therapy of, and growth promotion in, animals and bacterial disease control in plants[27]. It was suggested that sulphonamide resistance genes can be transferred from commensal bacteria via integrons, transposons or plasmids, into more virulent bacteria in the intestine[28]. Comparative analysis of the pChi7122 plasmids with those in the public databases using BLASTn showed that pChi7122-2 shares high homology with plasmids fromShigella sonnei(pEG356), an urinaryE. coliisolate (pHK01), EAEC (pAA), andK. pneumoniae(pKF3-70), respectively (with 100% identity and 70% coverage). The pChi7122-3 genome has shown homology with only one plasmid, theE. coliplasmid R721 (with 99% identity and 90% coverage), which includes the type IV fimbriaepiloperon[29],[30]and shufflon[31],[32]. Mauve alignment of pChi7122-2 and pChi7122-3 with their respective homologous plasmids confirmed these homologies (Fig. S1). TheeitABCDregion from pChi7122-2 was compared to its equivalent in pHK01 (HM355591.1), pEG356 (FN594520.1), pAPEC-O2-ColV (NC_007675.1), pAA (FN554767.1), and pAPEC-O1-ColBM (NC_009837.1) (A); and sugars pathways genome regionpChiA pChiOTDRin pChi7122-2 to its equivalent found in the genomes ofS. Enteritidis (AM933172.1),S. Gallinarum (AM933173.1),S.Weltevreden (FR775220.1) andS. Agona (CP001138.1) respectively (B). New putative sugar utilization pathways identified in pChi7122-2 An important aspect of pathogenesis is the ability of bacteria to adapt their metabolism to the available nutrients by coordinating their metabolism with their life cycle[35]. Recent reports have shown that in the intestine, both commensal and enterohemorrhagicE. coli(EHEC) require multiple carbon metabolic pathways[36],[37]. In this study, DNA sequence analysis of pChi7122-2 has revealed the presence of two systems of sugar utilization pathways. This system, with two divergent operons, consists of a gene for a starvation-sensing protein (pChiA) located in the opposite orientation to four successive genespChiOTDR(Fig. 2B,3). These genes have no significant homology with DNA sequences of otherE. coliavailable on public databases, as determined by MegaBLASTn search analysis, but share 94% homology (with 100% coverage) with the chromosomal DNA sequence of genomes ofSalmonellaEnteritidis (AM933172.1), Gallinarum (AM933173.1), Weltevreden (FR775220.1) and Agona (CP001138.1), respectively (Fig. 2B). The sequence analysis of this region in theseSalmonellaserovars has determined that, with the exception ofS. Agona, in which thepChiA-equivalent gene is truncated, the organization of thepChiOTDRhomologous genes in the genome of the four pathogens is the same (Fig. 2B). The identities of the proteins translated by these genes were between 86%–99% (Fig. 2B,Table S3, andFig. S3). Illustration of the proposed biochemical pathway for putative sugar utilization encoded by the operonpChiOTDR(A), the predicted 3D model and function of each enzyme are presented; and diagrammatic representation of the genetic organization of the putative sugar utilization operonpChiA pChiOTDR(B). The two promoter regions identified are indicated with arrows. Bioinformatic analysis indicated that pChiR may act as a transcriptional regulator ofpChiOTDRgenes. The promoter region contains independent CRP binding boxes indicated in red. The promoter elements forpChiOTDR(Ppchi) located in the positive DNA strand are underlined. The promoter elements forpChiA(PpChiA) in the negative strand are in bold and red without underlining. The putative functions and the predicted 3-D structures of thepChiAandpChiOTDRgene products, determined by Blast-PSI and HHpred[38], show thatpChiAencodes for a bifunctional dehydratase that utilizes both D-mannonate and D-altronate as substrates[39]andpChiOTDRencode for a gluconate 5-dehydrogenase, pChiO; an exonate sugar transport, pChiT; an L-idonate 5 dehydrogenase, pChiD; and a regulator protein GntR-like, pChiR, respectively (Table S3,Fig. 3A). Two promoter regions, PpChiAand PpChi, with independent cAMP receptor protein (CRP) binding boxes[40],[41], were detected in the promoter region ofpChiAandpChiO(Fig. 3B). Bioinformatic analysis indicated that pChiR is a putative transcriptional regulator from GntR family[42]. In the absence of glucose, the preferred carbon source forE. coli, the CRP would activate the pChi7122-2 sugars pathways[40],[41]; whereas pChiR would have an opposite effect. It is known that colonic mucus contains several sugar acids that represent an important source of nutrients and that genes involved in the catabolism of N-acetylglucosamine, sialic acid, glucosamine, gluconate, arabinose, and fucose are expressed in both commensalE. coliand EHEC[36]. It has also been reported that UPEC bacteria grown in urine express enzymes for catabolism of sialic acid, gluconate, xylose, and arabinose[43]and genes involved in the transport of gluconate and related hexonates are up-regulated inS.Typhimurium in macrophages[44], suggesting that the new pChi7122-2 sugar pathways could also be important either in the pathogenesis of APEC, as well as inSalmonellaserovars Enteritidis, Gallinarum, Weltevreden and Agona or in their persistence in different hosts. AA, amino acid; -, absent; NSH, no significant homology. Intestines are suspected to be a primary reservoir of ExPEC strains causing diseases in both humans[50]and chickens[5]. To determine if large plasmids would increase the fitness of their carriers in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract environment, we assessed the ability of strains to colonize intestine cells and resist both acid and bile, attributes that allow enteric bacteria to live and persist in the intestine of their host[51]. APEC strain χ7122 associates with and invades into intestinal epithelial cells without affecting the distribution of the tight junction protein ZO-1 Some APEC strains are genetically similar to human ExPEC, especially to uropathogenicE. coli(UPEC)[52], and could cause human diseases[53]. Herein, we investigated the ability of APEC-derivative strains to associate with, and invade into, human cells of the kind that may be targeted by human ExPEC bacteria during their commensal life cycle in the intestine. The intestine is suspected to be a reservoir of ExPEC that cause infections in humans[50]. Since APEC strains are now considered as potential food-borne pathogens that could be transmitted to humans via poultry products[4],[6],[28], we aimed to investigate the interaction of APEC-derivative strains with 3-D organotypic models of human intestinal epithelial cells. The 3-D model of intestinal epithelium used in this study has been shown previously to mimic the in vivo parental tissue more closely than monolayer cultures with regard to morphology and function[54]. The highly differentiated character of the 3-D intestinal cells is reflected in the presence of distinct apical and basolateral polarity, increased expression and better organization of tight junctions, extracellular matrix, and brush border proteins, highly localized expression of mucins, and multiple epithelial cell types relevant to those found in vivo[55]. Our data showed that APEC-derivative strains were able to associate with, and invade into, human intestinal epithelial cells, and large plasmids did not have significant effect on these characteristics (Fig. 4). Although tight junctions efficiently restrict most microbes from penetrating into deeper tissues and contain the microbiota, some pathogens have developed specific strategies to alter or disrupt these structures as part of their pathogenesis, resulting in either pathogen penetration, or other consequences such as diarrhea. In this study, evaluation of different APEC-derivative strains for their interaction with 3-D human intestinal epithelial cells, showed that although these strains attached and invaded into these cells, they did not disturb their tight junctions, based on immunofluorescence evaluation (Fig. 4). These data suggest that invasion of the intestine and dissemination would not occur through intercellular transportation of the bacteria, which could potentially disseminate through transcellular transportation, a mechanism used by meningitis-causing bacteria, includingE. coliK1 to invade brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs)[56]. These bacteria could live as commensals in the intestines from where they shed and cause diseases in different hosts or other sites of the same host.

Our study also confirmed the importance of the full expression of O78-antigen LPS for the acid tolerance ofE. coli[65], and demonstrated that the nature of LPS had a minor effect on this stress response (Fig. 5B). Large plasmids increase biofilm formation at host temperatures Bacterial biofilm formation is a major concern in both medical and industrial systems. Biofilm formation is associated with many medically-important pathogenic bacteria, as an estimated 65-80% of all human infections are thought to be biofilm-related[66]. However, elucidating the mechanisms of biofilm formation necessary for establishing strategies for their prevention and treatments is becoming a matter of urgency. In general, the different strains tested formed more biofilms at 30°C than at 37°C or 42°C (Fig. 6A). Compared to the wild-type, the plasmidless strain produced significantly more biofilm at 30°C (P<0.05) (Fig. 6A). In the same conditions, the presence of the three plasmids, either individually or in combinations in the strains, reduced the level of biofilm formation to the level of the wild-type strain (Fig. 6A). In contrary, at host temperatures (37° and 42°) (Fig. 6A), the plasmidless strain produced less biofilm than the wild-type strain, with the data being statistically significant (P<0.05) at 42°C (Fig. 6A). Biofilm formation of different strains were compared at different temperatures: χ7122 and its plasmid derivatives strains: No-plasmids (χ7368), pChi7122-1 (χ7394), pChi7122-2 (χ7392), pChi7122-3 (χ7367), pChi7122-1,2 (χ7561), pChi7122-1-3 (χ7562), and pChi7122-2,3 (χ7274) (A),E. coliK-12 (χ6092) and its derivatives: pChi7122-1 (χ7346), pChi7122-2 (χ7347), and pChi7122-3 (χ7348) (B), and χ7122 and its LPS derivative strains : rough mutant O78(-) (χ7145), smooth strains with either O1-LPS (O1) (χ7193) or O111-LPS (O111) (χ7167) (C) at either 30°C, 37°C, or 42°C. The biofilm formed by the plasmid-cured strain, highly produced at 30°C (Fig. 6A), is probably promoted by no-plasmidic factors preferentially expressed at 30°C and at early stage of biofilm formation; among them curli required for development of biofilm and adhesion[69]. Expression of biofilm in the environment (30°C) would be beneficial for plasmidless strains; in these conditions, biofilm will allow these bacteria to be in close proximity with other bacterial species and acquire transmissible genetic elements. A novel putative sugar utilization pathway operon that is not present in otherE. colistrains but found inSalmonellaserovars, an ABC iron transport system and a type IV fimbriaepiloperon were located on pChi7122-2 and pChi7122-3 respectively. Multiple plasmid-encoded mechanisms, including toxin-antitoxin modules and the novel sugar pathway could be important in the fitness and persistence of APEC χ7122. Bacterial strains and growth conditions Antibiotic susceptibility testing of strains was performed and interpreted via disk diffusion method, as recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)[81],[82]. A collection of one hundred human strains isolated from the main clinical extra-intestinal sources (50 UTI and 50 non-UTI)[19], eighty APEC strains, and forty-five entericE. colistrains (from our collection) were used to study the distribution of pChi7122-2 and pChi7122-3-associated genes among different groups of pathogenicE. coliby PCR. Unless otherwise stated, bacteria were routinely grown in Luria Bertani (LB) broth or on MacConkey agar supplemented with 1% lactose at 37°C. Strains were stored as stock cultures at −80°C in peptone-glycerol medium. All wild-type derivative strains grew similarly in LB and reached the OD600∼1.0 when incubated overnight (O/N) at 37°C standing, except the strain χ7561 (pChi7122-1, pChi7122-2) which had a slightly lower growth and its OD600was around 0.8 when grown in the same conditions. Plasmid sequencing and annotation The DNA sequences of pChi7122-2, pChi7122-3 and pChi7122-4 plasmids were derived from contig sequences of the whole genomic DNA of APEC χ7122. The sequences were manipulated to the standard of an ‘Improved High-Quality Draft’[83]. The program Artemis[84]was used to identify the plasmids and collate data. For each of the three plasmids all the sequence gaps were closed by directed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the products sequenced with big dye terminator chemistry on ABI3730 capillary sequencers. All the plasmids were circularized and contiguated using this method. The DNA sequences were annotated to identify coding sequences and repeat sequences in Artemis and the vector NTI suite of programs was used to confirm the previous analysis. To identify plasmids with similar sequences, pChi7122-2 (FR851303) and pChi7122-3 (FR851304) were compared by BLASTn at NCBI. Plasmid sequences of pEG356 (FN594520.1) fromShigella sonnei, pHK01 (HM355591.1) from a urinaryE. coliisolate, pAA (FN554767.1) from EAEC, and pKF3-70 (FJ494913.1) fromK. pneumoniae, and R721 (AP002527.1) a trimethoprim and streptomycin resistant plasmid from anE. coliwere downloaded. Plasmid sequences were aligned and then visualized using ACT and Mauve v2.3.1[85]. Schematic plasmid drawings were constructed using DNAplotter[86]. Amino acid sequence and protein structural-based alignments were performed using the CLC Free Workbench software tool (v. 6.1 CLC bio A/S, Aarhus, Denmark) and the web-based interface for ESPript v.2.2 (http://espript.ibcp.fr/ESPript/cgi-bin/ESPript.cgi)[87], respectively. The 3-D structure of the proteins pChiA, pChiT, pChiO, pChiD, and pChiR were predicted using position specific iterative (PSI)- BLAST alignment and HHpred[38]. Prevalence of pChi7122-2 (eitA) and pChi7122-3 (pilSand pilV) genes among avian and human pathogenicE. coli One hundred humanE. colistrains isolated from the main clinical extra-intestinal sources (50 UTI and 50 non-UTI)[19], eighty APEC strains, and forty-five entericE. colistrains (from our collection) were screened by PCR[19]for the presence of theeitA,pilS, andpilVgenes using the primerseitAF:5′-AACTGCGGCTATCAGGAGAC-3′andeitAR :5′-CAGGTCATATCCCACAGCTT-3′;pilSF:5′-CTTCTCTTTCTGCACACCGT-3′andpilSR:5′-TGTGATTGTAACGGAGCC-3′;pilVF:5′-TCTATACAGGCGAGTATTTA-3′andpilVR:5′-AATTCATACCAGAATACTCA-3′. The primers were designed from the sequence of pChi7122-2 (eitA) and pChi7122-3 (pilSandpilV). The growth rates of strains were compared in iron-sequestered medium using LB containing 100 µM of α,α′-dipyridyl alone or supplemented with either Heme (Sigma, 600 µg ml−1), hemoglobin (Sigma, 60 µg ml−1), or FeSO4(Sigma, 20 mM: control). The growth rates were also tested in minimal medium MM9[12], MM9 with thiamin (1 µg ml−1) and 0.1% casamino acid, and supplemented with glucose, lactose, arabinose, mannose, galactose, glucuronic acid, or glucoronic acid (0.2%) as source of carbon at 37°C shaking (180 rpm). The OD600was recorded every hour over 24-hour period. Interaction of strains with 3-D INT-407 human epithelial cells Antibodies specific for O78-LPS (Denken Seiken) and the human tight junction protein ZO-1 (Invitrogen) were used for confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) imaging. Antibodies were of porcine and mouse origins, respectively, and were used at a dilution of 1∶500 (anti-O78-LPS) and 1∶100 (anti-ZO-1). Goat anti-porcine and anti-mouse secondary antibodies labeled with Alexa Fluor 555 (Invitrogen) were used to detect the bound primary antibodies anti-O78-LPS and anti-ZO-1 respectively and were diluted 1∶500 in blocking solution (8% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Triton-X100 in DPBS). Cell nuclei and the F-actin cytoskeleton were visualized with 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole hydrochloride (DAPI) and phalloidin (Invitrogen), respectively. The fixation and staining of 3-D aggregates was performed as described previously[88]. Optical sections of the 3-D aggregates were obtained using a Zeiss LSM 510 Duo laser scanning microscope equipped with detectors and filter sets for monitoring emissions of the selected fluorophores. Images were acquired using a Plan-Neofluar 40×/1.3 oil DIC objective and were analyzed with the Zeiss LSM software package. Axiovision 4.8 software from Carl Zeiss was used to further process collected images. Sensitivity of strains to deoxycholate (DOC) and acid shock tolerance To determine the ability of bacteria to survive at sub-lethal bile concentration, different strains were grown rotating to an OD6001.0 in LB medium. Five-microliters of serial ten-fold dilutions of each strain were spotted on both LB agar and LB agar containing 1% (w/v) DOC plates and incubated overnight at 37°C. For acid shock assays, bacterial cells were grown at 37°C in LB broth, pH 7, O/N standing. Cultures adjusted to the same OD600of 1.0 were diluted 1∶1,000 in LB, pH 2.5, and incubated at 37°C with gentle shaking (50 rpm). Samples were cultured by direct plating on LB agar after 8 h and 18 h to determine the percent survival following acid stress. As controls, bacteria were also grown in LB, pH 7 in the same conditions to determine if the growth of bacteria was affected. Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Bonferroni's multiple-comparison test (GraphPad Prism software, version 5.07). Differences between average values were also tested for significance by performing an unpaired, two-sided Studentttest. The levels of significance (Pvalues) are reported and values ≤0.05 were taken to be significant.
