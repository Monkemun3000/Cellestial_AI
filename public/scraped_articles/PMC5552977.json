The draft genome sequences of sixBacillusstrains, isolated from the International Space Station and belonging to theBacillus anthracis-B. cereus-B. thuringiensisgroup, are presented here. These strains were isolated from the Japanese Experiment Module (one strain), U.S. Harmony Node 2 (three strains), and Russian Segment Zvezda Module (two strains). De novoassembly statistics of theBacillusspp. isolated from the ISS U.S., U.S. Segment Harmony Node 2. Japan, Kibo Japanese Experiment Module (JEM). Russian Federation, Russian Segment Zvezda Module. The six International Space Station (ISS) isolates were aligned (NUCmer [8], Parsnp [9]) against members of theB. cereus sensu latogroup genomes (10). The PacBio assemblies were used for all isolates with sufficient read coverage, and Illumina assemblies were used for the remaining isolates. Based on genome size estimates (5.2 to 5.3 Mb), NUCmer pairwise alignments (>99.9% average pairwise nucleotide identity) and maximum-likelihood phylogenetic placement, all six isolates were found to exhibit a very high degree of similarity. The complete genome sequences were deposited in NCBI under the accession numbers listed inTable 1and can be accessed from the NASA GeneLab system (GLDS-64;https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-64). Part of the research described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), California Institute of Technology, under a contract with NASA. The contributions of S.R., R.K.P., T.E.B., S.K., A.P., J.K., T.J.T., M.J.R., and N.H.B. were funded under contract no. HSHQDC-07-C-00020 awarded by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) for the management and operation of the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center (NBACC), a Federally Funded Research and Development Center. This research was also funded by 2012 Space Biology (NNH12ZTT001N) grant no. 19-12829-26 under Task Order NNN13D111T awarded to K.V., which also funded the postdoctoral fellowship for A.C.S., and by JPL subcontract 1506453 to G.E.F. The research carried out at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory was funded by 2014 Space Biology (NNH14ZTT002N) grant no. NNX15AJ29G awarded to C.J., which also funded J.A. and C.T. The contribution of S.P.V.T. was supported by the European Space Agency (MAP Project no. AO-LS-99-MAP-LSS-018 “biofilms”) and SRON (MG-064/MG-068). We thank Kazuyuki Tasaki, Director of the JEM Utilization Center, and Julie Robinson, Chief Scientist of the ISS (U.S.) for arranging Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) approval to use information on strains collected during the routine operation and maintenance of the JEM-Kibo Module. We also thank Hermie J. M. Harmsen and Hendrik I. J. Roest for providing the Russian isolates and logistical support, as well as Jonathan Hnath, Kathy Fronda, Gregory Horn, and Henry Lupari from NBACC for technical assistance.
