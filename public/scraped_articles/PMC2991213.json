Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and three-dimensional (3D) woven poly(ɛ-caprolactone) (PCL) scaffolds are promising tools for skeletal tissue engineering. We hypothesized thatin vitroculture duration and medium additives can individually and interactively influence the structure, composition, mechanical, and molecular properties of engineered tissues based on hMSCs and 3D poly(ɛ-caprolactone). Bone marrow hMSCs were suspended in collagen gel, seeded on scaffolds, and cultured for 1, 21, or 45 days under chondrogenic and/or osteogenic conditions. Structure, composition, biomechanics, and gene expression were analyzed. In chondrogenic medium, cartilaginous tissue formed by day 21, and hypertrophic mineralization was observed in the newly formed extracellular matrix at the interface with underlying scaffold by day 45. Glycosaminoglycan, hydroxyproline, and calcium contents, and alkaline phosphatase activity depended on culture duration and medium additives, with significant interactive effects (allp< 0.0001). The 45-day constructs exhibited mechanical properties on the order of magnitude of native articular cartilage (aggregate, Young's, and shear moduli of 0.15, 0.12, and 0.033 MPa, respectively). Gene expression was characteristic of chondrogenesis and endochondral bone formation, with sequential regulation of Sox-9, collagen type II, aggrecan, core binding factor alpha 1 (Cbfα1)/Runx2, bone sialoprotein, bone morphogenetic protein-2, and osteocalcin. In contrast, osteogenic medium produced limited osteogenesis. Long-term culture of hMSC on 3D scaffolds resulted in chondrogenesis and regional mineralization at the interface between soft, newly formed engineered cartilage, and stiffer underlying scaffold. These findings merit consideration when developing grafts for osteochondral defect repair. Articular cartilage possessesa complex, zonal architecture that enables smooth articulation at the joint surface and rigid attachment to the subchondral bone. Since bone-to-bone interfaces are known to integrate better and faster than cartilage-to-bone interfaces, tissue-engineered osteochondral constructs are a promising technique for articular cartilage repair.1,2Indeed, various composite grafts have been explored for osteochondral tissue regeneration utilizing a variety of cell-seeded scaffolds, including hyaluronan sponges with calcium phosphate supports,3nonwoven poly(glycolic acid) (PGA) meshes with collagen-hydroxyapatite supports,4three-dimensional (3D) printed poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)/poly(lactide) scaffolds with poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)/tricalcium phosphate supports,5agarose gels with devitalized trabecular bones,6and collagen gels with hydroxyapatite supports.7 Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) are a promising cell source for osteochondral tissue engineering, due to their multilineage differentiation potential.8,9Moreover, dynamic interaction between intrinsic (genetic) and extrinsic (i.e., chemical, mechanical, and temporal) factors determine the developmental fate of hMSCs10,11and tissue-engineered constructs.12,13Appropriate control of these factors may lead to favorable outcomes in osteochondral tissue engineering. The present work describes cartilage and bone tissue engineering using hMSCs and a 3D woven scaffold that we recently developed.14 Poly(ɛ-caprolactone) (PCL) was selected as the scaffold material because it degrades relatively slowly15and possesses an appropriately high bulk stiffness to facilitate MSC differentiation toward skeletal lineages.16In our recentin vitrostudy17chondrogenesis and mechanical functionality were clearly evident for 21-day constructs made from hMSCs embedded in Matrigel and cultured statically on 3D woven PCL scaffolds, with average aggregate and Young's moduli (HAof 0.37 MPa andEof 0.41 MPa, respectively) approaching values reported for normal articular cartilage (HAof 0.1–2.0 MPa;Eof 0.4–0.8 MPa).18–20 In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that culture duration and medium additives can individually and interactively influence structure, composition, biomechanics, and gene expression in engineered skeletal tissues generated using hMSCs and 3D woven PCL scaffolds. On the basis of our recent finding that static culture supported chondrogenesis in thisin vitromodel,17all constructs in the present study were cultured statically. We selected to seed the PCL scaffolds with hMSC mixed in a type I collagen gel such that gel entrapment enhanced cell seeding efficiency and helped to maintain spherical cell morphology for promotion of chondrogenesis.21In one group of constructs, the medium was supplemented with soluble molecular mediators associated with chondrogenic differentiation of hMSCs (i.e., transforming growth factor [TGF]-β, insulin, and dexamethasone),22whereas in the other group the medium contained additives associated with osteogenic differentiation (i.e., serum, β-glycerophosphate, and dexamethasone).23Properties of the resulting engineered tissues were assessed at multiple levels at culture days 1, 21, and 45. Construct preparation and cultivation All cell culture reagents were obtained from InVitrogen or Sigma, unless otherwise specified. The hMSCs were derived from bone marrow aspirates obtained from a healthy, middle-aged adult man with informed consent according to an Institutional Review Board–approved protocol at Case Western Reserve University. Before seeding on PCL scaffolds, the hMSCs were expanded by ∼10-fold during a single passage in which cells were plated at 5500 cells/cm2and cultured in basic medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 1% penicillin-streptomycin-fungizone supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 10 ng/mL of fibroblast growth factor-2; Peprotech). The 3D woven scaffold was made from PCL yarn (24 μm diameter per filament; 44 filaments/yarn, Grilon KE-60; EMS/Griltech). In brief, 11 in-plane layers aligned perpendicularly in the warp (x) and weft (y) directions were interlocked by a third set of yarns running in thezdirection using a custom-built loom.14The roughly 1.4-mm-thick scaffolds had porosity of 61% ± 0.2%, and approximate pore dimensions of 330 × 260 × 100 μm. One million P2 hMSCs were mixed with 30 μL of 0.6% (w/v) type I collagen gel (BD Biosciences), and the resulting mixture was pipetted onto each PCL scaffold (7-mm-diameter, 1.3-mm-thick discs). The dry scaffolds readily absorbed the cell–hydrogel mixture and the initial distribution of cells throughout scaffolds appeared to be relatively uniform, as in our recent report,17and therefore we did not elect to use the vacuum manifold setup described in other reports.14,24 The resulting constructs were placed in 12-well plates (one construct per well), incubated for 1.5 h at 37°C in a humidified, 5% CO2/room air incubator to allow collagen gelation, and then 2 mL of differentiation medium was added to each well. Two experimental groups were compared: (1) a chondrogenic group, in which basic medium was supplemented with 10 ng/mL recombinant human TGF-β3 (Peprotech), 1% insulin-transferrin-selenium (ITS+) premix (BD Biosciences), 100 nM dexamethasone (Sigma), 82 mg/L ascorbic-2-phosphate, 0.4 mM proline, 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids, and 1 M HEPES buffer, and (2) an osteogenic group, in which basic medium was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mM β-glycerophosphate, 100 nM dexamethasone, and 50 mg/mL ascorbic acid 2-phosphate. Culture media were completely replaced every 2–3 days, and constructs were harvested at culture day 1, 21, or 45. For 21- and 45-day constructs, the differentiating medium was replaced with serum-free medium 24 h before harvest, and the constructs were rinsed at the time of harvest. The constructs were not intentionally moved during the culture; however, they may have been inadvertently flipped over during medium replacement. Samples for histology (n= 2 per group) were formalin fixed, paraffin embedded, and sectioned to 5 μm.17Histological stains included hematoxylin and eosin, Masson's trichrome, safranin-O/fast green, and alizarin red at Histoserv. Immunohistochemical stains included collagen types I and II; these markers were assessed individually, similar to our previous description.17Apoptosis staining was done using a TACS 2 TdT-DABin situdetection kit (Trevigen). Samples for microcomputerized tomography (1–2 per group) were formalin fixed, immersed in 70% ethanol, and loaded into a microCT 40 system (Scanco Medical). Medium-resolution scans were obtained in 16 μm increments at energy of 45 kVp and intensity of 177 μA. Three-dimensional reconstructions were obtained using accompanying commercial software (Scanco). Amounts of DNA, glycosaminoglycans (GAG), and ortho-hydroxyproline (OHP) were measured on papain-digested samples (n= 3 per group), as previously described.17Construct amounts of calcium were measured (n= 3 per group) using a commercial assay (Pointe Scientific), following sample lyophilization, homogenization in 0.5 M HCl, and vigorous mixing for 16 h at 4°C. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was calculated (n= 3 per group) using Sigmafast p-nitrophenyl phosphate Tablets (Sigma) following sample homogenization in 0.75 M 2-amino-2-methyl propanol solution and measurement of absorptivity kinetics of reaction products at 405 nm with a Perkin Elmer Victor 3 plate reader (Perkin Elmer). Biphasic mechanical testing was performed to determine aggregate modulus (HA), hydraulic permeability (k), Young's modulus (E), and complex shear modulus (G*) as previously described.24Test specimens were obtained (n= 3–6 per group) by punching 3-mm-diameter cores from the centers of harvested constructs. Confined-compression creep tests and unconfined stress–relaxation tests were performed using a Bose-Enduratec ELF 3200 materials testing system. For confined compression test, specimens from the chondrogenic group were subjected to a 5-gf tare load and a 15-gf step compressive load, to ensure that strains remained in the infinitesimal range; specimens from the osteogenic group equilibrated to a 10-gf tare load before application of a 30-gf step compressive load. For unconfined stress–relaxation tests, specimens were equilibrated to a 5-gf tare load, and then strain steps of 0.04, 0.08, 0.12, and 0.16 were sequentially applied, with each step lasting for 900 s. Dynamic frequency sweep tests were performed using an ARES Rheometrics System. Specimens were placed between two porous rigid platens in a bath of phosphate-buffered saline. After equilibration to a compressive offset strain of 10%, a sinusoidal shear strain was applied. Parameters for the dynamic test include a shear strain amplitude 5% and an angular frequency (ω) that increased logarithmically from 1 to 50 rad/s. Values were reported forω= 10 rad/s. Primer Sequences Used in the Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (Forward and Backward, 5′ to 3′) A full-factorial two-way analysis of variance with Tukey's HSDpost hoctest was performed (JMP v8.0; SAS Institute, Inc.) to assess the effects of culture time and medium type on biochemical and biomechanical parameters. Values ofp< 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

In the chondrogenic group at 45 days, columns of rounded cells in lacunae were oriented perpendicular to the surface in the deep and middle portions of the construct, and elongated cells were aligned in parallel to the surface in the superficial portions (Fig. 3C). This cellular organization is analogous to certain architectural features present in normal articular cartilage. The 45-day constructs from the chondrogenic group exhibited mineralization at the interface between newly formed tissue and the underlying PCL scaffold, and in a ring-like pattern, based on histological cross sections (Fig. 4A), and top-down microCT views (Fig. 4B), respectively. Mineralization was colocalized in areas where hyaline-like cartilage matrix was also deposited, based on serial histological sections. Specifically, in the same region where alizarin red stain revealed mineralization (Fig. 4Ainset and C), a hyaline cartilage matrix was evident by safranin-O (Fig. 4D) and Masson's trichrome (Fig. 4E). In 21- and 45-day constructs in the osteogenic group, sparse mineralization was observed throughout the PCL scaffold, based on histological cross sections and microCT images (data not shown).

On the basis of previous studies associating ECM stiffness with MSC lineage commitment,16it is possible that mineralization was triggered by local mechanical cues imparted by the type I collagen gel and/or the PCL scaffold. For example, a comparative study of gel-like carrier materials showed that Matrigel suppressed calcification in ectopic implants of MSC-seeded constructs.25Alternatively, the slowly degrading scaffold (e.g., PCL) may have played a role, since mineralization was not observedin vitroin constructs based on hMSCs and a rapidly degrading PGA scaffold, even after extended (i.e., 12 week) culture.13Hence, different temporal patterns of mechanical cues provided by the two scaffold platforms (PCL or PGA) could explain the observed mineralization (or lack thereof). It is also possible that mineralization was triggered by local physiologic cues, such as gradients in oxygen tension or pH, as cartilage development is associated with anaerobic conditions, while bone development is associated with more aerobic conditions.42,43However, measurement of these physicochemical parameters was beyond the scope of the present study; hence, future studies may address their roles in inducing site-specific tissue differentiation. Likewise, it would be interesting to know whether the differences observed between chondrogenic and osteogenic media would also be seen with different scaffold materials and structures. One limitation of the current work is that the data set was derived from a single cell donor, whereas five or six different donors would be required to address the donor-to-donor variability in hMSCs that can result in unforeseen irregularities not associated with the current experimental parameters. In our ongoing work, hMSCs from additional donors are being combined with 3D woven PCL to address the important issue of donor-to-donor variability. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that culture duration and medium additives significantly influenced chondrogenesis and/or osteogenesis by hMSCs in the context of a scaffold with appropriate mechanical properties. The study opens up new possibilities for osteochondral tissue engineering. Furtherin vitroandin vivostudies are expected to lead to improved regenerative platforms (i.e., scaffolds andin vitroculture environments), and to more reliable therapeutic products.
