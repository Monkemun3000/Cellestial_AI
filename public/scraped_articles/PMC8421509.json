  "content": "Longitudinal characterization of multispecies microbial populations recovered from spaceflight potable water Received 2020 Oct 2; Accepted 2021 Jul 28; Collection date 2021. While sequencing technologies have revolutionized our knowledge of microbial diversity, little is known about the dynamic emergent phenotypes that arise within the context of mixed-species populations, which are not fully predicted using sequencing technologies alone. The International Space Station (ISS) is an isolated, closed human habitat that can be harnessed for cross-sectional and longitudinal functional microbiome studies. Using NASA-archived microbial isolates collected from the ISS potable water system over several years, we profiled five phenotypes: antibiotic resistance, metabolism, hemolysis, and biofilm structure/composition of individual or multispecies communities, which represent characteristics that could negatively impact astronaut health and life-support systems. Data revealed a temporal dependence on interactive behaviors, suggesting possible microbial adaptation over time within the ecosystem. This study represents one of the most extensive phenotypic characterization of ISS potable water microbiota with implications for microbial risk assessments of water systems in built environments in space and on Earth. Subject terms:Microbiome, Biofilms Microbial observatories have been established in a wide range of habitats to facilitate prolonged investigations into microbial communities7. The International Space Station (ISS) has been designated as a microbial observatory to enable research into microbial responses to the unique environment of spaceflight8. The ISS is the largest human-engineered structure in space and has harbored over two hundred international crew members since 2000. The ISS serves as a valuable observatory to study microbial populations, especially since human and microbial influx is well-controlled and limited compared with most built environments. Sustainable life support is provided to the crew through regenerated air and water by the Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS)9. To ensure crew health and safety, NASA has diligently preserved ISS air, water, and surface microbial samples for years10,11. An important part of ECLSS is the water-recovery system (WRS), which generates potable water from recycled urine, wastewater, and condensation using multiple mechanical and chemical purification processes9,12–14. Even with these harsh treatments, including distillation, filtrations, catalytic oxidation, and iodine treatment13–16, a variety of microbes are routinely isolated from ISS potable water, and previous in-flight water analyses indicated that bacterial concentrations have exceeded the current ISS specifications of 50 CFU/mL for all potable water samples17–19. Sources of contamination are reported to be mostly derived from the environmental flora entrenched in the water system itself18. Historical monitoring of the NASA ISS potable water system indicates a stable microbial population consisting of relatively few microbial species11. The presence of microbes in ISS potable water is not surprising, given their presence in drinking water on Earth. For example,Ralstonia, Burkholderia, Sphingomonas, andRhizobialesrecovered aboard the ISS are also commonly found in terrestrial potable or purified water systems3,10,11,20–24. Although ISS water contains the same types of microbes found in purified or potable water systems on Earth, there are several causes for concern. First, microbial ecosystems aboard the ISS are consistently exposed to the chronic stress of the microgravity environment, which is known to cause unexpected microbial responses that can impact human health (including enhanced virulence, biofilm formation, and antimicrobial resistance)8,25–35. Microgravity may present a selective pressure that could shape the adaptation/evolution of microorganisms. Second, many ISS potable water isolates are known to be strong biofilm formers23,24,36,37. This is of concern, as biofilms can be detrimental to the integrity and function of materials, inherently difficult to remove due to increased resistance to disinfectants and other antimicrobials, and present health risks to the crew38. Moreover, biofilm formation has been observed to increase in some microorganisms during spaceflight28,31. Finally, astronauts exhibit aspects of immune dysfunction during spaceflight and thus may be at increased risk for infection by both obligate and opportunistic pathogens11,39,40.

Diversity score was calculated as % = (the # of isolates of a species)/(total # of recovered microbes) × 100. They-axis indicates the percentage of diversity (diversity score) or the indicated species. Strains used in this study. ISS potable water isolates were recovered from the US system. The identifier is provided by NASA. TheBurkholderia cepaciacomplex (Bcc) strains, indicated with *, were recently further re-identified43. Antimicrobial resistance of the ISS potable water isolates Fig. 2. Antimicrobial susceptibility of the ISS potable water isolates, pure cultures. Preferred energy source of ISS potable water isolates We also examined whether carbohydrates or amino acids were the preferred energy source of the ISS isolates. We used agar media containing both casein amino acids and either sucrose or lactose, as well as the pH indicator phenol red. Most species appeared to prefer casein amino acids over either carbohydrate (indicated by the pink color around the colonies) (Fig.3a). Interestingly,C. metalliduransandR. pickettiiformed a wrinkled/rugose colony morphology, which is a common biofilm phenotype46, whileR. insidiosaproduced very smooth colonies (Fig.3b). We thus decided to further examine biofilm formation of the isolates. Fig. 3. Characteristics of pure cultures of ISS potable water isolates. aCore metabolic characteristics and extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) production. The media contains casein and phenol red with 1% lactose or 1% sucrose. Pink or yellow color indicates utilization of carbohydrate or casein amino acids in the presence of both. The colony phenotype on R2A media serves as control. EPS production is indicated with red colonies by 100 μg/ml Congo red.bRugose/wrinkled colony morphology. Biofilm formation and production of extracellular substances Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), including extracellular DNA (eDNA), protein, and extracellular polysaccharides, are known to be fundamental components of biofilm growth47–50. To detect EPS production by the ISS potable water isolates, we grew bacterial colonies on media containing either Congo red or crystal violet to stain the extracellular substances. Media containing Congo red revealed that strains ofR. pickettii,S. sanguinis, Bradyrhizobium spp., Mesorhizobium spp., andS. epidermidiswere strong EPS producers with bright-red colonies (Fig.4a). The crystal violet-containing agar also indicated biofilm formation. We thus further validated biofilm formation using an air–liquid-surface approach forMethylobacterium, Mesorhizobium, R. pickettiiandS. sanguinis(Fig.4b). All of the tested strains (exceptR. insidiosa) provided phenotypic evidence of biofilm formation with rugose/wrinkle colonies, EPS production, and/or air–liquid-interface biofilms. Fig. 4.

Types of interspecies interactions and their progressive changes over time. Three distinct interspecies interactions were observed in this study. Interaction criteria were based on migration of the cultures during growth in close proximity. Rowsaandbshow negative interactions, where one organism killed/inhibited (a, yellow arrows) or grew away from the other strain (b, red arrows). Rowcshows positive interaction, where one strain grew out toward and in some cases surrounded the other (blue arrows). Rowdshows neutral interaction, where no visible sign of interaction was observed between the organisms. The colonies on the left and right in each panel are respectively:a, 2014Burkholderia spp. and 2014Staphylococcus spp.;b, 2012Burkholderia spp. and 2012Ralstonia spp.;c, 2012Ralstonia spp. and 2012Sphingomonas spp.;d, 2014Burkholderia spp. and 2014Bradyrhizobium spp. We also observed a correlation between isolation year and the type of interspecies interaction betweenR. insidiosaand eitherS. sanguinisorMethylobacterium. For these strains in our study, species isolated in the same year exhibited positive relationships, while neutral relationships were observed when species from different years were cocultured (Fig.8a–b).

The years isolated are indicated above colonies, shown in the same color. Microbial interactions within natural and artificial environments are typically investigated over a short period of time (hours to days). Longer-term interactions may only become evident during repeated observations of the same environment. Microbial observatories have been established in a number of environments51–53. These studies show how long-term changes may occur in a community due to alterations of environmental factors or the introduction of new species. In the current study, we used the ISS water-recovery system as a microbial observatory. Unique aspects of this environment include microgravity and the limited opportunities for the introduction of new microorganisms via crew exchanges and resupply missions8,54. Frequent microbial sampling is performed to mitigate risks to crew health and system performance10,11. While identification of isolates can provide useful information, phenotypic analysis enables an increased understanding of long-term effects of the spaceflight environment on microbial physiology and functional species’ interactions. In this study, we characterized antimicrobial susceptibility, single- and multispecies biofilm formation, EPS production, hemolytic subpopulations, preferred energy source, and multispecies interactions of sixteen ISS potable water isolates. Our analysis using archived ISS isolates showed thatRalstonia and Burkholderia, known biofilm formers, were the major bacterial genera between 2009 and 2016. Microbes interact with their neighbors in mixed communities and compete for space and resources in diverse environments55–59. Polymicrobial interactions between water isolates have been shown to affect biofilm functional characteristics, including drug resistance and morphology60–64. However, none of these studies were longitudinal in nature. Of particular relevance to our study, Thompson et al.64recently conducted elegant experiments using six ISS potable water microbial isolates (including some of the same species used in our study) and showed the contribution of individual community members to the robustness of polymicrobial biofilm formation. Interestingly, this work found that some bacterial community members were necessary for polymicrobial biofilm formation and that predation by phage or predatory bacteria did not selectively remove specific bacterial community members. While microbial interactions may appear to be stable in short-term studies, this may not be true for longer-duration interactions65–67. Such microbial dynamics are critical to better understand the types of interactions and functional relationships that may occur in environments such as the ISS potable water microbial community over time. These studies highlight the importance of investigating the effects of long-term polymicrobial interactions in many different environments. Indeed, complex relationships between cohabiting species and a loss of antagonism over time have been frequently documented in longitudinal studies of pulmonary isolates from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients68–71. A recent longitudinal study usingPseudomonas aeruginosaclinical isolates from CF patients suggested that the long-term development of metabolic divergence contributed to cooperative interspecies interactions that evolved over decades72,73. Fig. 9. Hypothetical microbial coevolution model associated with interspecies interactions of ISS water isolates indicates potential formation of new relationships over time. A and B indicate different bacterial genera. It is worth noting that studies have reported reduced immune function in astronauts during spaceflight, which when coupled with alterations in virulence, biofilm formation and antibiotic resistance observed in some microorganisms during spaceflight, suggests an increased risk for infectious disease28,29,31,34,35,75–78. Our observation of hemolyticBurkholderiasubpopulations that were multidrug resistant in ISS potable water samples confirms previous work by O’Rourke et al.43and suggests an additional risk for opportunistic infections. We expanded on these previous findings43by profiling the type of hemolysis (α,β,γ) in theBurkholderiaisolates and discovered unstable hemolytic phenotypes, as well as variations in colony morphology and pigmentation. Interestingly, there was no clear association between hemolysis, mucoidy, or colony pigmentation. These same three phenotypes were unstable during our testing and produced the observed unpredictable colony variations during repeated passage on agar plates. To our knowledge, this is the first report that ISS Bcc isolates exhibit unstable hemolysis, mucoidy, and pigmentation phenotypes. These unstable pathogenic characteristics also occur in several organisms on Earth79–82. Notably, studies using microbial communities isolated from terrestrial water systems have shown increased resistance to antimicrobial agents and enhanced biofilm formation61. In addition, studies using microbial communities isolated from spaceflight water systems have shown increased biofilm formation and bacterial predation in multispecies biofilms31,61,64. Should the same phenotypic instability occur in spaceflight, it could present a challenge for detection and pose a risk for astronaut health. Further investigation is in progress to understand the role of microbial community interactions in antibiotic resistance, the virulence of select ISS potable water isolates, and potential underlying mechanisms. Our data also revealed distinct patterns of biofilm formation by the ISS potable water isolates that may be representative of the different species tested in this study. One potential explanation of the diverse biofilm patterns observed may be the different extracellular matrix components, as revealed by ConA and CFW staining, which stain α- and β-linked polysaccharides, respectively. We also observed that EthD-2, which does not penetrate the membrane of living cells, was observed at unexpectedly high levels inS. sanguinis, Ralstonia spp., C. metallidurans,Methylobacterium, andS. epidermidis. The increased EthD-2 signal in these cells may reflect eDNA in the biofilms, as has been previously shown with similar species47,83–85. We plan to conduct future studies to identify the mechanisms involved in these bacterial interactions and biofilm formation. Strains and culture conditions Strains were obtained from NASA and isolates were identified by 16 S rRNA gene sequencing and/or a biochemical identification using a VITEK system (BioMerieux) by the NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC). Lists of ISS potable water isolates archived by NASA from the US water system between 2009 and 2015 were obtained online44. Diversity assessments using these publicly available data were performed as described in the text. Potable water isolates used in this study from early (2009), middle (2012), and late (2014) years were provided by NASA JSC on commercial R2A media. Strains were cultured at 28–29 °C in a humidified chamber for 1–10 days on the following solid media: TSA (MP biomedicals, 091010717; Difco 214530), R2A agar (Becton, Dickinson, 218263), or mR2A agar (modified R2A agar; Teknova, R0005; Difco 214530). Prior to each experiment (for all strains), single colonies were isolated on R2A agar (1.5% agar) or mR2A agar (1.3% agar) from frozen stocks, and individual strains were cultured in R2A broth (Teknova, R0005) at room temperature to stationary phase of growth. The growth kinetics of each strain were determined at the beginning of the study to confirm that experiments were all performed at the same phase of growth. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) Strains were individually cultured to stationary phase in R2A broth, and 10-fold serial dilutions were prepared. We chose to test a range of antibiotic concentrations in our study based on literature searches, which included (a) concentrations commonly used for the same or similar organisms, including minimum inhibitory concentrations, and (b) reports that spaceflight can profoundly alter the antibiotic susceptibility of some bacteria86,87. Diluted and undiluted samples were plated on mR2A plates containing antibiotic(s) or NaCl at specified concentrations and incubated at 28–29 °C in a humidified chamber. The AST plates were monitored for approximately one week and bacterial survival was scored by the dilution showing microbial growth. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and sample preparations Biofilms were developed on sterile glass cover slips in broth cultures of each individual strain for 24 h at RT. Cover slips containing pure culture biofilms were subsequently washed with sterile Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) to remove planktonic bacteria and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, Electron Microscopy Sciences) for 20 mins, following gentle washing with cold DPBS twice. In a limited-light environment, the samples were stained with SYTO-9 green fluorescent stain (10 mg/mL, nucleic acid stain, Thermo Fisher ScientificS34854) for 15 min, Concanavalin A conjugated with Alexa Fluor™ 633 (500 mg/L, α-polysaccharide stain), Ethidium Homodimer-2 (EthD2, 1 mg/mL, dead-cell stain, Thermo Fisher Scientific E3599), or Fluorescent Brightener 28/Calcofluor White (0.7 mg/mL, β-polysaccharide stain, Sigma F3543) for five minutes. Biofilms were imaged using a Leica TCS SP8 LSCM with sequential scanning. Images were processed using Leica LAS software. Three to six stacks of horizontal plane images (1024 × 1024 pixels) with a z-step of 3 μm (the distance between the images) were acquired for each sample from two or more randomly chosen areas. Two independent experiments were performed. Fluorescence images were acquired with excitation at 405 nm (1.57%), 488 nm (4.98%), 514 nm (10.1%), or 633 nm (3.1%); emission filter DAPI (420–460 nm), FITC (498–545 nm), mCherry (565–610 nm), or Alexa-644 (648–700 nm) and gain 540.2 V (PMT), 60% (HyD), 65% (HyD), or 60% (HyD). Image scanning was carried out by sequential scanning with seq-1 (405-nm laser, pinhole 0.31), seq-2 (488 nm and 633 nm, pinhole 0.32), and seq-3 (514 nm, pinhole 0.31). Interspecies and mixed-species interaction testing Individual strains were grown in R2A broth as described above. Cells were centrifuged at 7000 r.p.m. for 15 mins and pellets were resuspended in fresh R2A broth to concentrate by 10 times. To assess interactions between designated strains, 10-µl samples of each isolate were dropped onto R2A agar (1.5%) at the same time at a distance close enough to allow for interaction but far enough away to avoid fusion of the droplets. Pairwise combinations of every strain in this study were examined. For mixed-species assays, samples were prepared in the same way to test the interaction between two strains. Equal volumes of the 10X- concentrated strains were mixed and 10 µl of these mixtures were drop-applied on R2A agar (1.5%). Different strains recovered from the same year were tested as one set to study mixtures of two species or all species. Incubation, monitoring, and recording were conducted as described above. For most assays (except hemolysis and CLSM), microbial growth on plates was monitored over seven days by taking photos and recording observations every 1–2 days, mostly due to the varying growth speeds for different strains. All assays presented in this paper were repeated at least in triplicate. All statistical analyses were performed using Graphpad Prism 7 or Microsoft Excel. Mean value and error bars (standard error of the mean) are indicated. Further information on research design is available in theNature Research Reporting Summarylinked to this article.
