Received 2015 Jun 15; Revised 2015 Aug 24; Accepted 2015 Sep 4; Issue date 2015 Oct. Fundamental mechanisms associated with gravitropism in woody stems ofPopulusinvolve relocalization of the PIN3 auxin transporter and interacting roles for auxin, gibberellic acid, and the ARBORKNOX2 transcription factor in regulating fiber development and gravibending. Several competing hypotheses for force generation by tension wood formation have been proposed (Clair et al., 2006;Goswami et al., 2008;Mellerowicz and Gorshkova, 2012) but all involve the development of fibers with specialized wall properties. Notably, the G-layer is a tertiary cell wall layer in tension wood fibers characterized by low lignin, high cellulose, and a low cellulose microfibril angle (Norberg and Meier, 1996;Clair et al., 2011) that may be fundamental to force generation. Fasciclin-like arabinogalactan-encoding genes (FLAs) are highly upregulated during tension wood formation (Lafarguette et al., 2004;Andersson-Gunneras et al., 2006;Azri et al., 2014), and theFLAprotein products have been shown to affect stem biomechanics through changes in cellulose deposition and/or cell wall structural properties (MacMillan et al., 2010). Thus, in addition to serving as molecular markers of tension wood development, FLA proteins could be directly involved in contributing to the altered mechanical properties of tension wood. Additionally, xyloglucan endotransglycosylase (XET)-dependent linkages between the G-layer and secondary cell walls have been identified and have been implicated in the transmission of tensile stress between the G-layer and adjacent cell wall layers (Mellerowicz et al., 2008;Mellerowicz and Gorshkova, 2012). At the regulatory level, large numbers of genes are differentially expressed in tension wood, including large suites of cell wall- and hormone-related genes (Déjardin et al., 2004;Andersson-Gunneras et al., 2006). Individual transcription factors have been characterized that affect wood development (Zhong and Ye, 2013), including thePopulusClass I KNOX homeodomain protein ARBORKNOX2 (ARK2; Potri.002G113300), which is orthologous toArabidopsis thalianaBREVIPEDECELLUS/KNAT1 (At4g08150) (Chuck et al., 1996;Venglat et al., 2002).ARK2is expressed broadly in the cambial zone and lignifying cells and affects cell differentiation and expression of tension wood-related genes (Du et al., 2009). However, to date there are no transcription factors identified that specifically affect tension wood development, and the transcriptional networks underlying tension wood development remain poorly defined. Here, we present experiments inPopulusthat identify the cells responsible for graviperception, describe changes in radial auxin transport during graviresponse, and describe theARK2andGA-sensitive transcriptional networks underlying tension wood development. We suggest that the early graviresponse of auxin transport toward the cambium on the tension wood side of the stem and toward the outer cortex on the lower side of the stem sets in place a developmental switch leading to the different transcriptional and developmental outcomes of these tissues.

FLAExpression Reveals DifferentialGAResponse across Wood Types and ARK Genotypes The negative gravitropism of woody angiosperm stems is fundamentally different from that of herbaceous stems. The herbaceous stem achieves negative gravitropism through differential growth on the bottom of the stem that pushes the stem upward. By contrast, the woody stem undergoes differential growth on the top of the stem to produce tension wood that pulls the stem upward with contractile forces (Sinnott, 1952;Wilson and Archer, 1977;Ruelle, 2014). In this study, we identified key regulatory mechanisms involved in negative gravitropic responses in woodyPopulusstems, including the cells responsible for graviperception, the initial graviresponse via relocalization of the PIN3 auxin transporter, and interacting roles for auxin,GA, and the ARK2 transcription factor in regulating fiber development and gravibending. UsingPopulusas a model species, we found that graviperception likely occurs directly in the woody stem in specialized cells containing starch-filled amyloplasts that sediment toward the ground. These cells are further defined by expression of the auxin transport protein, PIN3, which relocalizes toward the ground during gravistimulation. The PIN3-expressing cells are initially found in the endodermis, similar to what has been found in Arabidopsis (Friml et al., 2002) and other herbaceous stems, but later in development cells within the secondary phloem acquire PIN3 expression and possess amyloplasts. Thus, even though the endodermis is eventually lost during the outward expansion of the cortex during secondary growth, older woody stems can continue to sense gravity as new cells within the secondary phloem acquire PIN3 expression. Importantly, the reorientation of PIN3 toward the ground in gravistimulated woody stems would be predicted to have different outcomes on auxin transport in the top versus bottom of the stem. Because of the radial organization of the stem, on the top (tension wood side) of a gravistimulated stem PIN3 orientation is toward the cambium and center of the stem, whereas in the bottom (opposite wood side) of the stem PIN3 orientation is toward the cortex and periphery of the stem. These orientations are reflected in expression of a DR5:GUS reporter in our experiments, which shows preferential cambial expression on the top and cortical expression in the bottom of gravistimulated stems. This lateral auxin transport and response represents the earliest known graviresponse of woody stems and provides an obvious initial mechanism triggering the different developmental fates of xylem tissues that develop on the top (tension wood) versus bottom (opposite wood) of the gravistimulated stem. Additionally, we found evidence that fiber production can be genetically decoupled from the maturation of cell walls competent of generating contractile force. We imaged two molecular markers of functional tension wood G-layers: JIM14 immunolocalization of arabinogalactan proteins (including FLAs) andXETin gravistimulated stems of wild-type trees and trees with increased or decreasedARK2transcripts. Stems with decreasedARK2transcript abundance produce more fibers but are delayed in fiber maturation (as assayed by Jim14 andXETlabeling) and display reduced gravibending. Stems with increasedARK2transcripts produce fewer fibers, but fiber maturation and gravibending are enhanced. Thus, force generation and gravibending can be genetically decoupled from fiber differentiation, per se. While we expect that the dramatic differences in fiber maturation amongARK2genotypes is a primary factor, undoubtedly other differences such as stem stiffness also contribute to the observed differences in gravibending among these genotypes. In all experiments, a minimum of three biological replicates were included for each treatment. Histology, Imaging, and Auxin Transport Measurement Time-lapse movies were captured using Wingscape time-lapse digital cameras (Wingscapes; EBSCO Industries). Plants were positioned horizontally and imaged once every 10 min on the first day and then once per hour for 2 weeks. Quantification of stem lift and curvature was analyzed using custom R scripts, using data derived from digitized tracings of stems from individual frames taken from time-lapse movies. Tracings analyzed were from the base of the stem to the apex of curvature (defined as the basal point of tropism of the primary, herbaceous portion of the stem). Stems were sectioned for histology using a Vibratome Series 1000 (Heath Company) to a thickness of 50 to 100 µm. Sections for anatomical assays were stained with astra blue and phloroglucinol (Ruzin, 1999) and visualized with a Leica DMB compound microscope using a Leica DFC450C digital camera with live image stitching using Leica Live Image Builder software. The Pt-PIN3 antibody was raised against a conjugated peptide (DQREKEGPTGLNKLGSS-C) unique to paralogousPopulusPIN3-like proteins Potri.008G129400 and Potri.010G112800 in rabbits and used at a dilution of 1:250. To assay specificity of the antibody, membrane proteins were extracted from both leaf and stem tissues ofP. alba×P. tremulaclone INRA 717-IB4. Tissues were ground in liquid nitrogen and suspended in an extraction buffer before extraction as previously described (Abas and Luschnig, 2010). Resulting pellets were frozen at −80°C and then thawed and subjected to a second extraction using transmembrane protein extraction reagent (FIVEphoton Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Immunolocalizations were performed using Vibratome stem sections that were fixed at room temperature in formalin, acetic acid, and alcohol for 45 min under vacuum. Sections were then stepped to PBT (1× PBS with 0.2% Tween 20) and washed four times 15 min each. Sections were then blocked (1× PBS, 2% fish gelatin, 1% BSA, and 0.2% Tween 20) for 1 h prior to addition of the primary antibody. The JIM14 antibody was obtained from the Complex Carbohydrate Research Center (University of Georgia, Athens, GA) and used at a dilution of 1:500. After overnight incubation at 4°C, sections were washed four times in 1× PBT, blocked for 1 h, and probed with biotin-labeled antibodies (for JIM14, biotin-xx-goat-anti-rat IgG, Life Technologies A10517; for Pt-PIN3 biotin-xx-goat-anti-rabbit IgG, Life Technologies B2770) at 1:400 dilution. After overnight incubation at 4°C, sections were washed four times with PBT, blocked for 1 h, and 4 μL Streptavidin Alexa Flour-488 (Life TechnologiesS11223) added per milliliter of block. After 0.5 h incubation at room temperature, sections were washed four times with PBT prior to visualization on a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope. GUS staining was performed on 100- to 150-µm thick sections by vacuum infiltration of staining solution (100 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7, 10 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mg/mL X-glucuronide, and 100 µg/mL chloramphenicol) followed by overnight incubation at 37°. Sections were cleared in 70% ethanol prior to imaging on a Leica DMLB compound microscope with Leica DFC450C digital camera and live image stitching using Leica Live Image Builder software. Basipetal (toward the root) auxin transport was measured in stems of poplar seedlings in tissue culture (Groover et al., 2006) using a radio-tracer auxin transport assay adapted fromArabidopsis thalianainflorescences (Lewis and Muday, 2009). Developmentally matched seedlings with consistent stem thickness were stripped of leaves and cut 20 and 40 mm from the shoot apex, forming a 20-mm section. These samples were inverted and placed into an open 0.5-mL microcentrifuge tube containing 200 μL 100 nM3H-IAA (24 Ci/mmol; American Radiochemical) such that the apical cut end was submerged. Assay tubes were placed in a sealed box filled with water to prevent evaporation. After 18 h, the seedlings were removed and the apical 10 mm from the site of auxin application was removed and discarded. The next remaining 10-mm basal section was then divided into 2-mm segments and assayed for radioactivity in a Beckman LS6500 scintillation counter. The average andseof3H-IAA in each sample is reported relative to the distance to the apical end. Plants grown as described previously were transferred to 8-liter pots in Sunshine Mix 4 (SunGro Horticulture) and grown in a greenhouse in Placerville, CA without supplemental light for 3 months. ForGAsoil drench treatments, 0.01%GAin water was added to each pot to give an approximate concentration of 29 µmGAin the soil. Trees subjected to gravistimulation were placed horizontally 4 d afterGAtreatments were applied, and differentiating xylem for RNA-seq was harvested from all plants 2 d after gravistimulation commenced. For gravistimulated trees, bark was removed from the top (for tension wood) or bottom (for opposite wood) quarter of the stem and differentiating xylem harvested by light scraping with a sterile double-edged razor blade. For upright trees, the stem was randomly divided in half, and two xylem samples were independently harvested from opposing sides. For all trees, xylem was harvested from the twentieth leaf to the midpoint of the total length of the stem and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was isolated by grinding the tissue to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen, followed by extraction using Trizol (Life Technologies) using the manufacturer’s suggested protocol. RNA samples were then treated with RNase-free DNase (Qiagen) prior to secondary isolation using the Qiagen RNeasy kit following the manufacturer’s protocol. Quality and quantity of RNA was assessed using Qubit (Life Technologies) and Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies), respectively, prior to generation of RNA-seq libraries using the Illumina TruSeq Library Preparation Kit V2. Six samples were multiplexed into each lane of an Illumina HiSeq run to produce 50-bp single-end reads. ARK2ChIP-seqdata were produced and analyzed as previously described (Liu et al., 2015) and are available as NCBI SRI accession SRP0533 or through popGENIE (http://popgenie.org/). For each RNA-seq library, contamination from adaptor sequences was removed using scythe V0.95 (https://github.com/vsbuffalo/scythe), and sequenced reads were trimmed using sickle (Joshi and Fass, 2011) with default settings. Sequenced reads were then mapped to thePopulusgenome assembly V3.0 (http://www.phytozome.net/poplar.php) using TopHat v2.0.6 (Trapnell et al., 2009), and reads forPopulusV3.0 gene models were counted using HTseq (Trapnell et al., 2009) version 0.5.4p1. Gene expression levels were calculated as reads per kilobase per million reads using the TMM normalization method in the package edgeR V3.6.8 (Robinson et al., 2010). All statistical analyses were implemented in R (R Development Core Team, 2014) unless stated otherwise. Coexpression and module analyses were performed using functions from the R package WGCNA V1.41-1 (Langfelder and Horvath, 2008) and publically available scripts (http://labs.genetics.ucla.edu/horvath/CoexpressionNetwork/Rpackages/WGCNA/). Briefly, coexpression relationships between genes were summarized as an adjacency matrix and raised to the soft threshold power of eight. The soft threshold power was determined based on a greater 80% model fit to scale-free topology and low mean connectivity. Coexpression modules were defined as clusters of highly interconnected genes and calculated using hierarchical clustering of dissimilarity of the topological overlap measure. Hierarchical clustering was performed using dynamic tree cutting with a minimum module size of 500 and a cut height of 0.998, and closely related modules (0.3) based on module eigengene values were collapsed. Module stability was assessed by resampling 75% of the RNA-seq libraries and rerunning the coexpression analysis 20 times (Langfelder and Horvath, 2012). Traits were related to modules using module eigengene values. Module correlations for experimental treatments such asARK2genotype, wood type, andGAtreatments were tested using ANOVA, and wood chemistry phenotypes were tested using Fisher’s exact tests. Enrichment of ARK2ChIP-seqbinding in coexpression modules was determined based on a one-tailed hypergeometric distribution. Hub genes in the pink module were identified as genes that had high gene significance with wood type and high module membership in the pink module. Gene significance was calculated as the correlation between gene expression (reads per kilobase per million reads) and wood type. Module membership was calculated as the correlation between gene expression and module eigengene values for the pink module. Functional enrichment of coexpression modules was based onGOenrichment and calculated using Arabidopsis best BLAST hit ofPopulusgene models.GOanalysis was performed using ArabidopsisGOannotations because categories related to relevant categories (including meristem, shoot development, hormones, cell wall and cellulose) have limited annotation inPopulus. Analyses were performed using the Bioconductor package GOstats V2.30.0 (Falcon and Gentleman, 2007) with P < 0.01. Wood Chemistry and Cell Wall Phenotyping A micro-Klason method was applied to quantify lignin and cell wall carbohydrates (Coleman et al., 2007). Approximately 200 mg of extracted, oven-dried wood was reacted in a 125-mL serum bottle with 3 mL of 20°C 72% (w/w) sulfuric acid (H2SO4), with thorough mixing with a glass rod for 1 min every 10 min, followed by mixing for 15 s every 10 min thereafter. After 2 h, 112 mL deionized water was added to the reaction. The serum bottles were then sealed and immediately autoclaved at 121°C for 60 min. Sugar standards were subjected to the same treatment. Samples were allowed to cool and settle at 4°C and were vacuum-filtered through preweighed medium coarseness (M) sintered-glass crucibles. Each sample was washed (and the serum bottle also rinsed) with 200 mL warm (∼50°C) deionized water to remove residual acid and sugars and dried overnight at 105°C. The dry crucibles were reweighed to determine Klason lignin (acid-insoluble lignin) gravimetrically. The filtrate was then analyzed for acid-soluble lignin by absorbance at 205 nm using a UV/Vis spectrometer. Samples had to be diluted with 4% H2SO4to reach an absorbance value between 0.2 and 0.7. The concentrations for neutral cell wall-associated carbohydrates (glucose, xylose, mannose, galactose, rhamnose, and arabinose) in the hydrolyzate were determined using HPLC. Prior to injection, samples were filtered through 0.45-μm HV filters (Millipore). The samples for HPLC runs were prepared by exact weights of ∼950 mg hydrolyzate + 50 mg fucose as the internal standard. The concentrations of sugar monosaccharides were determined using a Dionex HPLC system (DX-600) equipped with an ion exchange PA1 column (Dionex), a pulsed amperometric detector with a gold electrode, and a SpectraAS3500 auto injector (Spectra-Physics). The column was equilibrated with 250 mM NaOH and eluted with deionized water at flow rate of 1 mL/min. Total lignin content was calculated as the sum of the Klason lignin and soluble lignin fractions. Lignin and cell wall sugar content was determined as a percentage of dry wood, based on the initial weight of the extract-free wood sample analyzed. Microfibril angle and cell wall crystallinity were determined by x-ray diffraction using a Bruker D8 Discover x-ray diffraction unit equipped with an area array detector (GADDS) on the radial face of the wood section precision cut (1.68 mm) from the growing stem isolated from the tension wood and opposite wood sections isolated from 10 cm above the root collar. Wide-angle diffraction was used in transmission mode, and the measurements were performed with CuKα1 radiation (λ = 1.54 Å), the x-ray source fit with a 0.5-mm collimator, and the scattered photon collected by a GADDS detector. Both the x-ray source and the detector were set to θ = 0° for microfibril angle determination, while the 2 θ (source) was set to 17° for wood crystallinity determination. The average T-value of the two 002 diffraction arc peaks was used for microfibril angle calculations, as per the method ofUkrainetz et al. (2008), while crystallinity was determined by mathematically fitting the data using the method ofColeman et al. (2007). Crystallinity measures were precalibrated by capturing diffractograms of pureAcetobacter xylinumbacterial cellulose (known to be 87% crystalline). Fiber length was analyzed using the woody material isolated from the tension wood and opposite wood side of each specimen, according toPark et al. (2008). In brief, each sample was macerated in a solution consisting of 30% hydrogen peroxide and glacial acetic acid in a 1:1 ratio (Franklin solution) at 70°C for 48 h. Following the reaction, the remaining fibrous material was washed with deionized water until the samples were neutralized. Subsamples were resuspended in 10 mL deionized, distilled water and analyzed on a fiber quality analyzer (FQA; Optest Equipment). Fiber length was recorded in millimeters.
