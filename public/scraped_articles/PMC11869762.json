During medium- to long-duration spaceflights, real-time microgravity can increase the health risks of astronauts. In particular, the disruption of intestinal homeostasis is closely related to other health problems, and it is necessary to monitor related treatment strategies. Ginseng is a well-known Chinese herbal medicine often used to maintain health. Ginseng total saponins (GTSs), which are the bioactive components of ginseng, have been reported to regulate immune homeostasis, anti-inflammation, and anti-oxidation. This study focused on the regulation of GTSs in intestinal homeostasis imbalance caused by microgravity. We found that GTSs intervention effectively improved the intestinal injury caused by simulated weightlessness, including reducing the pathological damage, increasing the expression of tight junction proteins and reducing the levels of inflammatory factors. Moreover, GTSs treatment significantly restored the levels of intestinal immunity-related genes and remodeled the gut microbiota. In particular, GTSs significantly increased the abundance of short-chain fatty acid metabolism-related bacteria, thereby increasing the level of propionic acid, butyric acid, isobutyric acid. Long-duration spaceflight missions face challenges due to a variety of factors, including high vacuum, intense radiation, and low magnitude of gravity. Microgravity exposure is the main difficulty that needs to be overcome in real time, which causes astronauts to be in sub-health for a long time, affecting flight tasks and physical fitness.1Several studies have shown that microgravity is closely related to health problems such as immune system disorders, cardiovascular dysfunction, and skeletal muscle loss. Intestinal microecology plays an important role in mediating the decline in these functions.2Under weightlessness conditions, the intestine directly suffers from structural damage caused by various stress factors, including disruption of intestinal barrier integrity and gut microbiota imbalance.3,4Moreover, the gut also regulates immune function and affects signal transduction between the host and intestinal microorganisms by producing intestinal microbial metabolites such as SCFAs.5,6Evidence from animal experiments has reported serious intestinal barrier damage under weightlessness simulation, including typical intestinal villi injury, downregulation of tight junction protein expression, cell apoptosis, and increased intestinal permeability.3Similarly, shortened intestinal villi, shallower crypt depth, and reduced mucin production in intestinal epithelial cells were observed in spaceflight rats.7,8Recent data also show that the fluctuation of intestinal flora caused by weightlessness will lead to the imbalance of the immune system and increase the risk of opportunistic infection. A study revealed that weightlessness caused change in the ratio of Bacteroides to Firmicutes, which may lead to the production of inflammatory cytokines by activating pattern recognition receptors8. In addition, microbiota metabolites also participate in the pathological changes of the digestive system related to spaceflight stress and play a role in the body signal transduction. Evidence shows that long-duration space flight significantly changes the gastrointestinal microbiota and related microbial metabolites of astronauts.9The exploration based on animal experiments has also identified changes in intestinal metabolome such as amino acids and short-chain fatty acids, which are related to immune dysfunction and intestinal flora disorders.5,6Thus, it is necessary to monitor intestinal microecological disorders caused by weightlessness and to discover related protective strategies to ensure the health of astronauts. In recent years, natural ingredients derived from plants or food, with the advantages of mild antibacterial activity, reparative action, and low resistance to human drugs, have shown broad application prospects in regulating the intestinal microecological balance.10As a perennial plant with homology of medicine and food, ginseng has been used for thousands of years in many countries to maintain health. Ginseng total saponins (GTSs), a bioactive compound in ginseng, is responsible for most of the immunological and pharmacological activities of ginseng.11According to previous records, GTSs have health benefits in regulating intestinal homeostasis, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-central nervous system diseases, and in maintaining immunity.12In particular, the effects of GTSs on intestinal immune regulation and inhibition of inflammation have been confirmed.13GTSs are also beneficial for increasing the diversity of the gut microbiota, enhancing the abundance of beneficial bacteria (Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides) and reducing the production of pathogenic bacteria (iron-removing bacteria, Helicobacter pylori) to enhance host health. In addition, the monomeric constituents of ginseng (including ginsenosides Rb1, Rg1, Rk3, and Re) can remodel the composition of the intestinal flora or modulate flora metabolites, thereby causing different effects on the intestinal barrier function, immune function, and host homeostasis.14–17 Because of its beneficial effects, CHM Taikong Yangxin prescription, which contains ginseng, has been used to keep Chinese astronauts healthy during their flights. In a previous study, we explored the potential of GTSs to maintain the neurological subhealth of astronauts.18However, the regulatory effect of ginseng on intestinal homeostasis under weightlessness conditions remains unclear, and the underlying mechanisms related to gut-brain interactions remain to be explored. Therefore, we used the hindlimb suspension (HLS) model to evaluate the potential and possible mechanisms of GTSs in maintaining intestinal homeostasis, which will help to expand the health effects of ginseng and provide novel understanding and treatment options for health problems, starting with intestinal homeostasis during space travel. Anti-occludin (Cat no. 27260-1-AP) and anti-claudin-1 (Cat no. 28674-1-AP) antibodies, HRP-conjugated Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L) (Cat no. SA00001-2), GAPDH (Cat no. 10494-1-AP) were obtained from proteintech (Wuhan, China). Acetic acids (Cat no. A298827), propionic acids (Cat no. P110446), butyric acids (Cat no. B110440), and isobutyric acids (Cat no. B1103522) were obtained from Aladdin Scientific (Shanghai, China). Specific pathogen-free male Wistar rats (200±20 g) were purchased from Beijing Charles River Experimental Animal Company [SCXK (Beijing, China) 2016–0006]. The animals were kept at a 12 h light/dark cycle environment with a humidity of 45–50% to acclimate for 5 days. All experiments were conducted according to the Principles of Laboratory Animal Care (NIH publication No.86–23, revised in 1996) and approved by the Institute of Medicinal Plants, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Animal Care and Use Committee [SYXK (Beijing, China) 2017–0020]. Rats were randomly divided into three groups (n=6): control (CON), hindlimb suspension (HLS), and the HLS treated with GTSs. The HLS model was established based on previous reports.20Briefly, the hindlimbs were attached to a separate device with tape and chain hooks to form a 30-degree head-down tilt for 28 days. The CON and HLS groups were administered the same volume of water or GTSs (200 mg/kg,ig) daily. Subsequently, feces were collected for 16s rDNA sequencing on day 25, and serum and intestinal tissues were collected for other analyses on the last day. Qualitative Analysis of Components in GTSs Ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography coupled with an electrospray ionization source and a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer (UPLC-ESI-QqQ-MS/MS), which contained an AB Sciex LC-MS system QTRAP® 6500, was used for separation and quantification. The samples were eluted using an ACQUITY UPLC BEH Shield RP18 column (2.1 mm×50 mm, 1.7 µm particles). The mobile phase consisted of solvent A (0.1% formic acid in water) and B (acetonitrile) and ran under the following program: 0~5 min, 10%~23% B; 5~15 min, 23%~35% B; 15~20 min, 35~48% B; 20~20.5 min, 48%~90% B; 20.5~21.5 min, 90% B; 21.5~23 min, 90%~10% B; 23~25 min, 10% B. The flow rate was set at 0.3mL/min, and the injection volume was 5μL. The column temperature was maintained at 30 °C, and the samples were stored at 4 °C throughout the analysis. Electrospray ion source (ESI) and MRM were performed in the negative mode using nitrogen as the drying agent. The curtain gas (N2) was 40 psi, the collision gas (N2) was 9 psi, and the spray voltage was 5500 V. The atomization temperature was 550 °C, atomization gas (ion source gas 1, N2) and auxiliary gas (ion source gas 2, N2) were used. N2) were both at 55 psi. The corresponding ion pairs and cone voltages are listed inTable S1. Fresh small intestinal tissue from the same part was rinsed with normal saline and fixed in 10% formaldehyde solution until analysis. H&E and AB-PAS staining were performed to observe the tissue pathology, inflammatory responses, and goblet cell hyperplasia. Mesenteric lymph nodes were prepared as single-cell suspensions and subsequently incubated with anti-CD3-FITC, anti-CD4-APC, anti-CD8-PE, and anti-CD45-APC antibodies (Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The stained cells were analyzed using a CytoFLEX Flow Cytometer (Beckman Coulter, USA). Gene expression levels were measured by real-time PCR. Briefly, total RNA was extracted from small intestinal tissue and reverse-transcribed into cDNA. The primers used are listed inTable S2. Data were calculated using the 2−ΔΔCTmethod with GAPDH as the internal reference for normalization. Transcriptome Analysis of Small Intestinal Tissue Small intestine sections were collected from the Con and HLS groups and transcriptome sequencing was performed using an Illumina HiSeq sequencer by Beijing Boyun Huakang Gene Technology Co., Ltd. Raw data from transcriptomic experiments were deposited in the NCBI SRA database (BioProject ID: PRJNA944741). The raw reads were filtered, and the clean reads were mapped to the rat reference genome (rn6) using HISAT software. Gene expression was quantified by fragments per kilobase of exon per million mapped values (FPKM), and the PossionDis algorithm was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs; log2(fold change) ≥1 and q value ≤0.001). DEGs were then subjected to GO functional annotation. RT-PCR analysis was performed to further screen the DEGs regulated by the GTSs. Primer sequences used are listed inTable S2. Gut Microbiota Structural Profiling The library was sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Paired-end reads from the original DNA fragments were merged using FLASH software. The sequences were analyzed using UPARSE Version 7.0, with the UPARSE-OTU and UPARSE-out ref algorithms. In-house Perl scripts were used to analyze the diversity values of alpha (within samples) and beta (among samples). An in-house Perl program was used to assign sequences to the same operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Quantitative analyses were performed as previously described by our group. The fecal sample (~10 mg) was thawed on ice and 200 µL of 50% methanol was added to prepare the homogenate. After centrifugation (4°C13,000 rpm, 10 min), 8 µL of the supernatant was collected. 50% methanol (72 µL), 1M EDC (10 µL), 1M O-BHA (10 µL), and 500 nM Acetic Acid-1-13C (5 µL; IS) were mixed with the supernatant. Derivatization was performed at 25 °C for 1h. Subsequently, 600 µL dichloromethane was added for extraction and 400 µL of the lower organic phase was collected and dried at 37 °C. Finally, 200 µL of 50% methanol was added to the sample, re-dissolved, and centrifuged, and the resulting supernatant was used to re-dissolve the sample. The supernatant was used for LC-MS analysis (AB Sciex LC-MS System QTRAP® 6500). Chromatographic separation was achieved using an ACQUITY UPLC HSS T3 column (2.1mm×100mm, 1.8 µm) at 50°C with a typical flow rate (200 nL/min). The mobile phase consisted of 0.1% formic acid in water (solvent A) and isopropanol (solvent B). The linear gradient was set as follows: 85%–85% A (0.0 to 1.0 min), 85%–64% A (1.0 to 8.0 min), 64%–50% A (8.0 to 8.5 min), 50%–50% A (8.5 to 10.5 min), and 50%–85% A (10.5 to 15 min). Mass spectrometry (MS) analysis was performed in the positive ion mode with an electrospray ion source (ESI) and MRM mode using nitrogen as the drying agent. The curtain gas (N2) was 35 psi, collision gas (N2) was 9 psi, and the spray voltage was 4500 V. The measured parameters for specific ion pairs are listed inTable S3. All data are expressed as mean ± SEM. Statistical analyses were performed GraphPad Prism 8 (La Jolla, CA, USA). Significant differences of multiple groups were analyzed using one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett post-hoc test or Kruskal–Wallis test followed by Dunn’s post-hoc test for multiple comparisons.P<0.05 were considered statistically significant. The Content of Eight Ginsenosides in GTSs Was Detected by UPLC-MS The MRM chromatograms of ginsenosides Rb1, Rb2, Rg1, Rg2, Rc, Rd, Re, and Rf from GTSs were optimized for quantitative analysis. The calibration curve of the eight compounds showed good linearity with the available standards (R2> 0.99), and the lower limits of quantification for the ginsenosides ranged from 2.4414 to 312.5 ng/mL, indicating sufficient sensitivity for quantitative evaluation. As a result, It contained 258.89 mg/g Rb1, 65.77 mg/g Rb2, 12.87 mg/gRg1, 26.14 mg/g Rg2, 93.72 mg/g Rc, 90.90 mg/g Rd, 105.34 mg/g Re and 20.87 mg/g Rf (Figure S1).

The intestinal microecology is co-defined with the intestinal barrier, intestinal microorganisms, and intestinal metabolites.36Previous studies described the effects of weightlessness on these factors. Jin et al indicated that impaired intestinal mucosal barrier function caused by weightlessness is closely related to the intestinal villi and tight junction structures.7In several tail-suspension rat models, researchers have observed typical pathologic features, such as intestinal villus shedding, decreased number of goblet cells, and inflammatory cell infiltration.7,37At the same time, the expression levels of tight junction proteins were significantly decreased and inflammatory cytokines were increased. Similar changes were observed in the gene expression levels of tight junction proteins (claudin and occludin) and pro-inflammatory factors (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6). HE staining confirmed the pathological injury of the small intestine in the HLS group, as well as the recovery potential of GTSs. Moreover, deficiency in mucin synthesis and secretion by goblet cells directly leads to intestinal mucosal barrier dysfunction. GTSs effectively restored the reduction in goblet cells caused by weightlessness, which is another factor that supports the protective function of the intestinal barrier. GTSs can improve intestinal microecological disorders and impair immune function caused by weightlessness. The underlying mechanism may be related to the “intestinal immune microbiota-metabolic” pathway. However, a more profound mechanism needs to be explored.
