The genusNaganishia[1] was resurrected fromCryptococcusand emended to accommodate thealbidusclade ofFilobasidiales, Tremellomycetes, and Basidiomycota [2,3,4]. The genusNaganishiacontains the following species as legitimate in MycoBank:N. adeliensis, N. albida, N. albidosimilis, N. antarctica, N. bhutanensis, N. brisbanensis, N. cerealis, N. diffluens, N. friedmannii, N. globosa, N. indica, N. liquefaciens, N. nivalis, N. onofrii, N. qatarensis, N. randhawae, N. uzbekistanensis, N. vaughanmartiniae, andN. vishniacii[2,3,4]. However, the addition ofN. floricolamade the list a total of 20Naganishiaspecies, but several of these members were yet to be validly described. In an ongoing Microbial Tracking experiment on the International Space Station (ISS), six yeast strains belonging to the familyTremellomyceteswere isolated [5], and whole-genome sequences (WGS) were generated [6]. Some of theNaganishiaspecies that were phylogenetically related to these ISS strains, which were reported to be psychrophilic or psychrotolerant species, isolated from Antarctica [4,7,8,9,10,11], also reported that the ISSNaganishiaspecies might also display properties related to cold adaptation and an increase in radiation resistance. In addition,Naganishiaspecies were also isolated from a variety of ecosystems, such as water [12], soil [13], tree trunk [14], air [12], Alpine glaciers [15], cheese, cereals [16], and human specimens [12]. Members of theCryptococcusspecies, from whichNaganishiaspecies have recently been separated, were reported to possess unique virulence factors associated with the pathogenesis [17,18]. The morphological transformation of normalCryptococcuscells into giant (Titan) cells was one of the factors contributing to cryptococcosis (an inhalation acquired infection) [19,20,21]. It was also reported that titanization was unique to theCryptococcus neoformans/C. gattiispecies complex, and not found in other budding basidiomycetous yeasts or in the ascomycetous yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae, when grown under similar growth conditions [21]. However, occasional enlarged cells have been reported inCryptococcus terreus. The ISSNaganishiastrains exhibited Titan-like cells, a phenotype similar to theC. neoformans/C. gattiispecies complex, when the ISS isolates were grown under simulated microgravity conditions. One of the objectives of this study was to characterize the Titan-like cells of the novelNaganishiaspecies isolated from the ISS environment. The microscopy analyses revealed the presence of Titan-like giant cells with abnormal morphology whenNaganishiaspecies were subjected to several stressors, including a combination of hypoxic 5% CO2and simulated ISS microgravity conditions. The second objective of this study was to utilize WGS for annotation in order to aid in the identification of genetic determinants related to cold adaptation and radiation resistance inN. tulchinskyi. The third objective was to determine the phylogenetic novelty of the ISSNaganishiastrains (n= 4) using microscopy and taxonomic affiliation based on multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) analyses, which included a seven gene concatenated (ITS, LSU, SSU,CYTB,RPB1,RPB2,TEF1) phylogeny [2]. 2.1. Sample Collection and Isolation of Microorganisms During the flight experiments of Microbial Tracking-1, several surface samples (1 m2) were collected from various ISS environmental locations. Previous publications had detailed sample collection, processing, and isolation of cultivable microorganisms from the ISS [5]. Briefly, internal ISS surface samples were collected using polyester wipes and then transported to Earth for processing. Samples were collected just prior to departure (within 5 days) and stored at 4 °C in the ISS, transported in cold packs (~4 °C) from ISS to the Earth, hand delivered at Long Beach, California after splash down, which were then carried in ice packs (~4 °C) during ground transportation, before storing at JPL at 4 °C for further processing. Total number of days for sample storage time from sample collection to processing was ~7 days. Unless otherwise stated, all reagents were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). The materials associated with the sampling wipes were placed in 200 mL of sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4) solution and plated onto potato dextrose agar (PDA), supplemented with chloramphenicol (100 µg/mL;v/v), to isolate fungi [5,22]. Microbial colonies grown at 25 °C for 7 days were picked from the media plates, purified, and stored for further analyses. Based on internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequencing, six yeast strains were tentatively assigned to the genusCryptococcus, and subsequent WGS characterization revealed that two strains were identified asPapiliotrema laurentii, while four strains belonged to a yet to be describedNaganishiaspecies [6], making this species the first known novel eukaryote to be isolated from the ISS [6]. 2.2. Whole Genome Sequencing Analyses The WGS used for the analyses were previously generated and published [6]. The WGS raw data was filtered with NGS QC Toolkit v2.3 [23] for high-quality (HQ) vector and adaptor-free reads for genome assembly (cutoff read length for HQ, 80%; cutoff quality score, 20). The number of filtered reads obtained were used for assembly with SPAdes 3.14.0 [24] genome assembler (k-mer size—32 to 72 bases) using default parameters. Genomic DNA sequences and predicted proteomes (where available) of all other strains used in this study were downloaded from NCBI, followed by comparative analyses. Among the 20 knownNaganishiaspecies, NCBI had ITS sequences available for all the species exceptN. indica. The gene sequences of all available strains were retrieved from NCBI, except for the four ISS strains, which were derived from their WGS during this study. Phylogenetic analyses based on individual genes (ITS, LSU, SSU,CYTB,RPB1,RPB2,TEF1) and MLST analyses (with the seven genes) were carried out with all availableNaganishiaspecies (n= 10). The individual gene sequences for all strains were first aligned separately using ClustalW, and for MLST, seven gene sequences for each strain were concatenated manually, aligned using ClusatalW, and used to generate a Maximum Likelihood Tree using MEGA 7.0.26 [25]. 2.4. Morphological Characterization under Simulated Microgravity Conditions 2.4.1. Growth Conditions for Phenotypic Analyses under Different Conditions Naganishiasp. IF6SW-B1Twas streaked on a Yeast extract- Peptone- Dextrose agar (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose, and 1.5% agar) plate and incubated at 30 °C for 48 h. After 48 h of growth, colonies were resuspended in PBS, and the cells were enumerated using a hemocytometer. The cells were then inoculated at an initial density of 2 × 105cells/mL in synthetic dextrose (SD) broth. Replicates (n= 3) of each yeast strain were grown under each condition tested. The cells were inoculated in three conditions; (a) the first set was inoculated in 5 mL of liquid media in a tube, incubated at 30 °C, and shaken at 150 rpm; (b) the second set was inoculated in 5 mL liquid media and incubated on a rotating platform in a CO2incubator (5% CO2) at 30 °C; (c) the final set was grown in 10 mL of liquid media in a high aspect ratio vessels (HARV, Synthecon Inc., Houston, TX, USA) and mounted onto a vertical rotating device (at 30 rpm) to simulate microgravity conditions, these were placed in a CO2incubator (5% CO2) at 30 °C. The CO2level of ISS habitat is ~10× more (~4000 ppm) than at Earth conditions [5]. Additionally, Titan cells were observed under 5% CO2level inC. neoformans[26]. Hence, morphological changes were characterized at this 5% CO2level. The autoclavable HARVs provided oxygenation via a flat, silicone rubber gas transfer membrane (Synthecon Inc.). The cultures were all incubated as described for 4 days, followed by cell pelleting for further analyses. Yeast cell samples grown under the three conditions described above were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS for 15 min at 4 °C. These cells were gently pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 3500 rpm, and cells were rinsed 3× with sterile PBS. Subsequent processing steps were carried out in the dark, where samples were covered with aluminum foil and protected from the light. Cell pellets were resuspended in 15 µM Calcofluor White and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Samples were then rinsed and pelleted as previously mentioned but with distilled H2O. After the third rinse, samples were pelleted again, and the pellet was resuspended with 1 µM TO-PRO®-3 (Fisher Scientific, Los Angeles, CA, USA) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Samples were further rinsed and pelleted, as previously mentioned, using distilled H2O. The resuspended samples were filtered through a 0.2 µM 25 mm Isopore Membrane Filter (GTBP) using a filter manifold. This membrane was removed, placed on a microscope slide, and a drop of antifade was added to the top. A coverslip was placed, and then, the edges were sealed. The samples were viewed using a Zeiss LSM 880 upright laser scanning confocal microscope and an Alpha Plan-APOCHROMAT 63× lens (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Yeast cell size and cell wall thickness were analyzed using ImageJ [28]. 2.4.3. Scanning Electron Microscopy Yeast cells grown under various conditions were preserved using 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Following the concentration, cells were immersed in a chilled 4% PFA and incubated at 4 °C for 10 min before the PFA was removed and washed in PBS buffer. Fixed cells were transferred into a 24-well plate, dehydrated in an isopropyl alcohol (IPA) series (50% to 100%), and stored at 4 °C. Samples were critically point dried in an Automegasamdri 915B critical point dryer (Tousimis, Rockville, MD, USA). Samples were attached to SEM stubs with carbon tape (Ted Pella Inc., Redding, CA, USA), followed by carbon coating with a Leica EM ACE600 Carbon Evaporator (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) to a thickness of ~12 nm. SEM analysis was performed with an FEI Quanta 200F (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA). 2.4.4. Transmission Electron Microscopy TEM was performed to examine cell wall thickness variations and analyze organelles’ differences between the different environmental stressors (CO2and simulated microgravity) induced Titan-like cells and standard cells, grown under Earth gravity, with 5% CO2and without CO2. For TEM, yeast cells were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde for at least one hour at 4 °C. Samples were rinsed in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2, and immersed in 1% osmium tetroxide with 1.6% potassium ferricyanide in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer for 1 h. After rinsing, samples were polymerized at 60 °C for 24–48 h in silicon molds. Thick sections (200 nm) were cut, stained with toluidine blue, and used. Thin sections (70 nm) were collected onto formvar-coated 50 mesh copper grids. The grids were post-stained with 2% uranyl acetate, followed by Reynold’s lead citrate. The sections were imaged using a Tecnai 12 120 kV TEM (FEI, Hillsboro, OR, USA) and data were recorded using an UltraScan 1000 with Digital Micrograph 3 software (Gatan Inc., Pleasanton, CA, USA). All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 9.1.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Specifically, data was tested for normal distribution with the D’Agostino and Pearson normality test, followed by non-parametric ANOVA using a post-hoc Kruskal–Wallis analysis. 2.5. Survey of Genes and Proteins Involved in Resistance Presence of various biomolecules responsible for pigment biosynthesis, radio-resistance, and microgravity tolerance inNaganishiaspecies andS. cerevisiae. ** Match > 75% of the protein sequence and e-value < 1 × 10−25; * Match < 75% of the protein sequence or e-value > 1 × 10−25. 2.6. De Novo Genome Annotation Datasets used for De Novo gene annotation using MAKER. * Expressed Sequence Tags database (ESTdb; Nature Genetics 4:332–3;1993) is a division of GenBank that contains sequence data and other information on “single-pass” cDNA sequences from a number of organisms. UniProt (2021) [32]. UniProt: the universal protein knowledgebase in 2021. Nucleic Acids Res 49, D480–d489. Firstly, de novo repeat identification and masking were performed using RepeatModeler [33]. Then, MAKER control files were generated (maker-CTL), and a first-round was run using the maker_opts.ctl control file. Data for the transcriptome assembly (EST), protein sequences (protein), and repeat annotations (rm_gff) was provided. Additionally, the model_org was set to ‘simple’ to annotate simple repeats, and inference predictions of genes directly from ESTs and protein homology were set (est2genome = 1, protein2genome = 1). Lastly, GFF and FASTA outputs were assembled together with GFF3toolkit [34]. Next, we predicted genes using the gene models generated with MAKER by training SNAP [35] and Augustus [36] using BUSCO [37]. For SNAP, we used models with an AED of 0.25 or better and a length of 50 or more amino acids. To train Augustus, we excised regions that contain mRNA annotations based on our initial MAKER run, with 1000 bp on each side, as described [38]. To run BUSCO, the Eukaryota set of conserved genes was used. The -m genome option was specified to provide regions that included more than just transcripts. The initial HMM model selected wasCryptococcus, which corresponded to the closest genus ofNaganishia(augustus_species = cryptococcus). The long option was set to optimize self-training Augustus. Following the BUSCO run, the second round of MAKER was performed using the SNAP and Augustus models. For this purpose, FASTA sequence files were replaced with GFF files (est_gff, protein_gff, and rm_gff), and est2genome and protein2genome were switched to 0. The third run of MAKER was performed, and the gene models were evaluated by counting the number of gene models and the gene lengths after each round and running BUSCO using the transcript sequences (-m transcriptome). Predicted protein sequences generated by MAKER were analyzed using InterProScan v5.51–85.0 [56] with default parameters. Functional annotations assigned by InterProScan per protein sequence were converted into collections of Gene Ontology (GO) terms using BLAST2GO [57] with default parameters. All assigned GO terms per protein were aggregated and visualized using the REVIGO web tool [58] with the “tiny” similarity cutoff (0.4) searched against theSaccharomyces cerevisiaeS288C database and using the SimRel measurement of similarity. Visualizations were generated using the code provided by REVIGO and using R3.6.3. The WGS and raw data have been deposited in GenBank under the BioProject accession number PRJNA623412 [6]. The genome sequences have also been deposited in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) GeneLab system (GLDS-290;https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-290; accessed on 5 December 2021). In addition to the WGS, we performed amplicon sequencing the ITS region from each strain [5], and their accession numbers are given below.NaganishiaIF6SW-B1 (KY218715.1);NaganishiaIF1SW-F1 (KY218664.1);NaganishiaIF7SW-B1 (KY218717.1);NaganishiaIIF5SW-F1 (KY218695.1). Several yeast strains belonging to theNaganishia(Cryptococcus)diffluensclade ofFilobasidialeswere isolated from two different flight collection experiments conducted aboard the ISS [5]. These strains, referred to as IF6SW-B1T, IF7SW-B1, IF1SW-F1, and IIF5SW-F1, were isolated from four different ISS locations and identified to be novel species belonging to the genusNaganishia,based on genomic characterization via polyphasic taxonomic approaches. The sampling of ISS surfaces, performed for this study, took place within the US on-orbit segments. Sampling campaign (denoted as I) was carried out on 4 March 2015, and the second one (denoted as II) was conducted on 15 May 2015. Samples collected during this study were: Node 3 (Locations #1, #2, and #3), Node 1 (Locations #4 and #5), Permanent Multipurpose Module (Location #6), U.S. Laboratory (Location #7), and Node 2 (Locations #8 and control). A detailed description of the various locations sampled was published elsewhere [59]. Strains IF6SW-B1, IF7SW-B1, and IF1SW-F1, were isolated during first sampling from Locations 6, 7, and 1, respectively. Strain IIF5SW-F1 was isolated from second sampling at Location 5. 3.1. Phylogenetic Analyses of Novel ISS Strains To confirm that these four ISS strains form a novel species, their phylogenetic affiliations were analyzed with other species belonging to the genusNaganishia. The MycoBank database documented 19Naganishiaspecies, and the CBS database showed only 11Naganishiaspecies. The gene sequences available on NCBI forNaganishiaspecies (n= 10) were used to generate phylogenetic maximum likelihood trees withC. neoformansCBS 132 strain as an outgroup. Phylogenetic analyses were carried out using seven genes: internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region rRNA gene, D1/D2 domain of large subunit (LSU or 26S) rRNA gene, small subunit (SSU or 18S) rRNA gene, and housekeeping genes, including two subunits of RNA polymerase II (RPB1andRPB2), translation elongation factor 1-α (TEF1), and cytochrome b (CYTB), which were used for differentiatingTremellomycetesspecies [2]. The respective gene sequences that were available on NCBI for differentNaganishiaspecies were included in the phylogenetic analyses. In addition, genomes of closely related members fromTremellomycetes(Goffeauzyma gastricusCBS 2288 (AF145323.1),Heterocephalacria arrabidensisCBS 8678 (AF444362.2),Piskurozyma cylindricaCBS 8680 (AF444360.1),Solicoccozyma aeriusCBS155 (AF145324.1), andTremella mesentericaCBS 6973 (AF444433.1)) were included withCryptococcus neoformansCBS 132 (AF444326.1) as the outgroup. Initially, seven individual phylogenetic trees using ITS, LSU, SSU,CTYB,RPB1,RPB2, andTEF1genes were generated and are presented inSupplemental Figures S1–S7. When tested individually, the phylogenetic analyses generated based on individual gene, formed a single group for all four ISS strains. There were no significant variations in ITS, LSU, and SSU gene sequences (Figure S3), whereas the other four genes (CYTB,RPB1,RPB2, andTEF1) invariably exhibited higher resolution in differentiating all theNaganishiaspecies. The ITS tree (Supplemental Figure S1) showed that the ISS strains were placed at the same position of the three recognized species,N. diffluens, N. liquefaciensandN. albidosimilis. ITS sequences of the four ISS isolates showed 100% similarity to the sequence ofN. albidosimilisCBS 7711T(AF145325),N. liquefaciensCBS 968T(AF444345), andN. diffluensCBS 160T(AF145330). However, ITS sequences ofN. vishniaciiCBS 7110Tshared 97.84% similarity (13 bp difference to GenBank accession no.AF145320.),N. uzbekistanensisCBS 8683Thad 97.55% similarity (14 bp difference to GenBank accession no.AF444339), andN. adeliensisCBS 8351Texhibited 97.34% similarity (14 bp difference to GenBank accession no.AF145328) with ISS isolates (Supplemental Figure S1). In the LSU tree (Supplemental Figure S2), the four ISS strains were placed at the same position that phylogenetically distinguished fromN. albida, N. adeliensis, N. vishniacii, andN. albidosimiliswith low bootstrap support. Comparing the LSU sequences of these ISS strains with closely related species showed a 97.71% similarity toN. albida(type strain, CBS 142; 14 different base pairs; GenBank accession no.AF075474), 96.41% similarity toN. albidosimilis(type strain, CBS 1926; 22 different base pairs; GenBank accession no.AF137601), 96.25% similarly toN. liquefaciens(type strain, CBS 968; 23 different base pairs; GenBank accession no.AF181515), and 95.92% similarity toN. diffluens(type strain, CBS 160; 25 different base pairs; GenBank accession no.AF075502) (Supplemental Figure S2). The taxonomic threshold predicted to discriminate basidiomycetous yeast species is 99.51% in the LSU region and 99.21% in the ITS region [1]. Hence, the sequence data and phylogenetic analysis of the LSU regions of the ISS isolates confirm they belong to a new species in the genusNaganishia(order Filobasidiales). The SSU tree (Supplemental Figure S3) demonstrated that these four strains were not separated from any of the recognized species. Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic tree, based on seven gene sequences (ITS, LSU, SSU,CYTB,RPB1,RPB2,TEF1), extracted from WGS of the respective type strains (superscript T) or from the available genomes, concatenated manually, showing the phylogenetic relationship ofN. tulchinskyisp. nov. with closely related members ofTremellomycetes. The gene fragment lengths in base pairs (bp) are given in parenthesis: ITS (620 bp); LSU (612 bp); SSU (517 bp);CYTB(339 bp);RPB1(317 bp);RPB2(1282 bp);TEF1(1084 bp). Bootstrap values from 1000 replications are shown at branch points. Bar = 0.05 substitution per site. 3.2. Titan-like Cell Characterization of Novel ISS Strains Confocal microscope-based analyses ofN. tulchinskyicells when grown under standard Earth gravity (SD), normal gravity with 5% CO2(CO), and simulated microgravity with 5% CO2(µG). Representative images of Calcofluor White cell wall-stained cells adjacent to bright field images are shown in (A). The µG cells appear to be larger and misshapen when compared to the typical yeast morphology demonstrated by SD and CO. Measurements for cell diameter were taken using the of Calcofluor White confocal images (B). Though smaller than µG cells, SD cells were statically smaller in cell size than CO cells (pvalue = 0.0440), while µG cells were statistically significantly larger than both SD and CO cells (pvalue ≤ 0.0001). Cell wall thickness was also measured using confocal microscopy (C). Cell wall thickness of SD and CO were not statistically different in size (pvalue ≥ 0.9999); however, µG cells had statistically significantly larger cell walls than both SD and CO cells (pvalue ≤ 0.0001). The scale bars for both confocal and bright field microscopic images is 40 µm. Statistical significance is reported aspvalue > 0.05 (ns), ≤0.05 (*), ≤0.01 (**), ≤0.001 (***), ≤0.0001 (****).pvalues of ≤0.01 (**) and ≤0.001 (***) were not noticed. Analyses of scanning electron microscope (SEM) micrographs of SD, CO, and µG grownN. tulchinskyicells demonstrated differences in conidia size, morphology, and daughter cell budding. SD (A) and CO (B) grown cells demonstrated similar standard yeast morphotypes, while µG (C,D) grown cells are larger, nonuniform in appearance, and exhibit random budding scars. In some instances, the µG budding scars have raised centers, while others appear to be concave. Additionally, some budding scars appear to be shedding or peeling from the surface of the cells. This phenomenon is highlighted with the white arrow (D). Representative SEM micrographs are given, and scale bar for all micrographs is 10 µm. Analyses of transmission electron microscope (TEM) micrographs of SD (A,B), CO (C,D), and µG (E,F) grownN. tulchinskyicells demonstrated differences in cell size, cell wall thickness, and internal organelle structures. SD and CO demonstrate similar size cells and similar intracellular morphology, while µG grown cells appear to have a different internal organizational structure of organelles. At higher magnifications (lower panels), the cell wall thickness can be seen to be thicker for µG grown cells than for SD or CO grown cells. The cells also appear to be having lower abundance of fine scale fimbriae on the surface of µG cells, as compared to SD and CO grown cells. Along with their large size, the µG grown cells are distinguished by the shedding and peeling bud scars from their surfaces, denoted by white arrows (C). Additionally, µG grown cells have the presence of large unknown organelles/structures, as denoted by the black arrow. Representative TEM micrographs are given. The scale bar for (A,C,E) is 1 µm, and the scale bare for (B,D,F) is 0.2 µm. Cryptococcusspecies have been shown to produce enlarged Titan-like cells to adapt to stress and contribute toCryptococcuspathogenesis [20,65]. Both functions may also be of relevance for these ISS strains. The polyploidy nature of the yeast cells should be investigated as this might shed insights into the adaptation of these cells to microgravity conditions. Even though confocal microscopy measurements and increased fluorescence content in the microgravity-grown cells were documented, analysis of the nucleic acid reads of heterozygous regions of the genomes and a comparison of the ratios for the various alleles is needed to confirm the polyploidy nature of these cells. It is documented inC. neoformansthat the enlarged polyploid Titan-like cells were able to generate progeny with aneuploidy. It was additionally found that the progeny of these Titan-like cells have both growth and survival advantages over typical cell progeny under stressful conditions [20]. Further gene characterizations are required to understand the molecular mechanisms associated with adaptation of novel IF6SW-B1Tyeast to space conditions [20]. While recent studies suggest that titanization is a rare phenomenon that occurs mostly in members of theC. neoformans/C. gattiispecies complex, the observation of Titan-like cells in ISSNaganishiaspecies is novel. Understanding how microgravity influences this process is important to predict the emergence of virulence inNaganishiaspecies and develop novel antifungal drugs. These antifungal drugs can be developed to inhibit the phenotypic transitions associated with fungal pathogenicity, especially since these strains were isolated across longitudinal sampling sessions of the ISS and appear persistent. Titanization and the increasing of cell size has been shown to aideCryptococcuscells evade the immune system [21,26,65,66,67]. By growing from the normal range of ~1 to 3 μm in diameter to >10 μm, Titan cells cannot be readily ingested by phagocytic cells and, thus, persist in host tissue. Moreover, our data show that Titan-like cells are more likely to survive and produce offspring, when confronted by multiple environmental stress conditions, than typical cells. Additionally, their normally sized offspring maintained an advantage over regular cells in continued exposure to stress. Titan-like cell progeny’s increased survival and genomic diversity might promote rapid adaptation to new or high-stress space conditions; however, more research is needed to confirm this aspect. 3.3. Genomic Analyses of the Novel ISS Strain Enriched GOSlim terms for biological process, cellular components, and molecular function inN. tulchinskyigenome. The Gene Ontology terms were summarized by purging redundant GO terms that were deduced by orthologous searches coupled with semantic similarity-based scatterplots using the REVIGO platform [58]. Novel species:Naganishia tulchinskyi,N. K. Singh and K. Venkateswaran, sp. nov. Etymology:Naganishia tulchinskyi(tul.chin. s’ky.i. N.L. gen. n.tulchinskyinamed after Igor Tulchinsky, an American Philanthropist supporting biomedical, computational, and space research). Diagnosis: Based on the morphological characteristics, strains IF6SW-B1T, IF7SW-B1, IF1SW-F1, and IIF5SW-F1 are similar toN. albidagroup, but phylogenetically distant from all knownNaganishiaspecies. Hyphae and pseudohyphae were not present, sexual reproduction was not observed, budding cells were present and ballistoconidia were absent.

Abbreviation: “+” positive; “-” negative; “NT” not tested; “w” weak reaction; “v” variable reaction. Ecology/Substrate/Host: DistinctNaganishiayeast colonies (n= 4) were isolated over two separate sample collection flights from three different locations. The type strain IF6SW-B1Tand two other strains (IF7SW-B1 and IF1SW-F1) were isolated during Flight 1 (March 2015), while the fourth strain (IIF5SW-F1) was isolated during Flight 2 (May 2015). Strain IF6SW-B1Twas isolated from a rack that contained crew clothes, crew preference items, office supplies, and ISS medical accessory kits (Location #6, Permanent Multipurpose Module Port 1). The second strain IF7SW-B1 was isolated from a rack being used for basic materials research in the microgravity environment of the ISS (Location #7, Overhead-3 panel surface of the Materials Science Research Rack 1). The third strain IF1SW-F1 was isolated from a viewing port in a small module devoted to the observation of operations outside the ISS, such as robotic activities, spacecraft approaches, and extravehicular activities (Location #1, Port panel of the Cupola). The fourth strain IIF5SW-F1 was the only strain in this study isolated during Flight 2, and it was cultivated from a storage rack made up of Nomex fabrics and used as a pantry to store batteries, printer cartridges, office supplies, etc. (Location #5, Overhead-4, Node 1, US module). Distribution: This novel species has yet to be found in any samples from other Earth environments. Material examined: The particulate matter associated with 1 m2surface area of the ISS environmental surfaces was examined. In summary, a novel yeast,N. tulchinskyi, was isolated from the ISS environmental surfaces that produced giant Titan-like cells under simulated microgravity conditions. Morphological characterization ofN. tulchinskyicells revealed that the cell wall is thicker under simulated microgravity and might help them withstand such unfavorable conditions, and these simulated microgravity-grown cells demonstrate a novel bud scar shedding trait. The phylogenetic analyses using the MLST approach showed that these are novel yeast. Further genomic characterization revealed genes responsible for cell morphogenesis and UVC resistance, reflecting a range of molecular mechanisms suited to respond to microgravity and radiation.

SEM (A-C) and TEM (D-G) micrographs highlighting the unusual μG grown Titan-like cell morphology. Titan-like cells show large concave and convex budding scars (A-C). A daughter cell can be seen budding from the mother yeast cell (black arrow), and appears to be altering the shape of the mother cell’s cell wall (B). Budding scars are shown to be peeling off of the yeast surfaces (white arrows) (A-C). This phenomenon is shown in TEM images, designated by white arrows (D-G). SEM scale bars are 10μm. TEM scale bars are 5μm (D), 1μm (E-F), and 0.5μm (G). The letter “N” distinguishes the nucleus (B, C, and E). Table S1. Reducing all protein-coding gene products from the predicted proteome of the novel type strain IF6SW-B1T to their most distinct Gene Ontology (GO) terms for Biological Process, Cellular Component, and Molecular Function. Frequency indicates the number of genes in UniProt associated with this term. Uniqueness is a measurement of average similarity of a term to all other GO terms, while dispensability measures the semantic distance between a term and all other GO terms.
