Salinity with a high sodium chloride concentration (≥40 mM) in soil or irrigation water is the main concern worldwide in the context of rapid climatic changes due to its impact on nearly 20% of the world's total agricultural land, and the economics of crop production [[1],[2],[3],[4]]. Simultaneously, the requirement to feed 9.3 billion people by 2050 is driving agricultural output into marginal regions, necessitating a significant advancement in the development of saline-tolerant crops [5,6]. The most susceptible stages to salinity are seed germination and seed establishment. Salinity triggers adverse changes in biochemical, physiological, and metabolic processes in the growing seeds [7,8]. Reduced water availability, ionic imbalance, the altered release of reserve nutrients, and changes in protein structural organization are some of the few consequences of salinity on seed germination [9,10]. Besides, the formation of damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS) causes oxidative damage to protein and lipids, DNA and RNA breakage, cell leakage, damage to cell membranes and organelles, loss of photosynthetic components, and cell death [11,12]. Seed priming is an age-old technique that has been proven to be an inexpensive, efficient, practical, and safe pre-sowing approach to combat the salinity-induced growth and developmental limitation of plants and to promote cost-effective and sustainable crop production on salt-affected soil [[13],[14],[15],[16],[17]]. Seed priming has been shown to be beneficial by promoting seed germination parameters, facilitating seedling development with an enhanced vigour, and boosting water and minerals uptake, under various abiotic stress conditions such as drought [18], chilling [19], salinity [20], heat [21,22], and heavy metals [23,24], etc. There are various approaches to seed priming such as hydropriming, halopriming, osmopriming, hormoprimimg, biopriming, thermopriming, and solid matrix priming [[25],[26],[27],[28],[29],[30]]. The consequences of priming are influenced by the priming agent, the duration of priming, and the dosage of priming agents [31]. There are several reports that water [[32],[33],[34]], sodium chloride [[35],[36],[37],[38],[39]], thiourea [40], proline [41], and polyethylene glycol [42,43] have been proven to be efficient priming agents for improving germination, seedling establishment, vigour, and tolerance under salinity stress. However, a large percentage of these findings are focused on germination parameters of model crops and cereals such asArabidopsis, chili, tomato, wheat, maize, sorghum, barley, etc. Brassica oleraceaL. represents a popular cash crop and the second most economical cooked vegetable after potato of the family Brassicaceae. It is recognised as the chief nutrient-rich crop, including a broad variety of phytochemicals with health-promoting qualities such as antioxidants, polyphenols, flavonoids, vitamin C, carotenoids, and tocopherols and some clinically important sulfur containing metabolites, i.e. cynidine, glucosinolates, siringin, etc. [44,45]. Therefore, ingestion of these cruciferous veggies has been linked to a lower risk of cardiovascular [46,47] and neurological diseases [48], type 2 diabetes [49], and malignancies such as colorectal, prostate, breast, bladder, colon, and pancreatic cancers [[50],[51],[52],[53]]. As a result,Brassica oleraceaL. crops, such as broccoli (var.italica), cabbage (var.capitata), cauliflower (var.botrytis), brussels sprouts (var.gemmifera) and kale (var.acephala) are classified as functional foods and considered as “Super Veggies” [54]. On an annual basis, 20 metric tonnes of cauliflower and broccoli are grown on 1.6 thousand acres throughout the world. According to FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization) of the United Nations, China and India are the world's largest producers, generating 1.42 million ha area having the annual production of 26.90 million tonnes per year, accounting for 74% of global production (FAO, 2019) [55,56]. However, these varieties sternly challenged by saline circumstances lead to a reduction in crop growth. Among theB.oleraceavarieties, Cauliflower (B.oleraceaL. var.botrytis) is generally considered moderately salt tolerant [57]. India produces around 13% of global vegetable output and ranks first in cauliflower [58], but as soil salinity rises, crop production and economic outputs may begin to fall. ManyB. oleraceacrops are now struggling with the effects of salt and other abiotic stressors as a result of intensive field usage of different fertilizers and the fast expansion of protected farming land [59,60]. However, scar attempts have been made to combat and ameliorate the possible adverse salt stress influence in cauliflower. The present study was conducted to investigate the impact of different hydro-, halo-, and osmo-priming agents on the seed germination indices, seedling performance, and physio-biochemical attributes of cauliflower (Brassica oleraceaL. var.botrytis) subjected to high salt stress by computing the correlation coefficient and principal components. Cauliflower (Brassica oleraceaL. var. botrytis) seeds were purchased from a local market in Udaipur, Rajasthan, India. This is a herbaceous annual vegetable plant that grows in the cool season with an average daily temperature of 15–20 °C. The homogeneous cauliflower seeds were disinfected with 1% NaOCl (sodium hypochlorite) solution containing 0.2% Tween-20 for 10 min and washed five times with sterilized distilled water to remove the disinfectant. The sterilized seeds were blotted and completely dried on a cellulose pad at 25 °C. To prime the seeds, they were hydroprimed [distilled water (H2O)], haloprimed [sodium chloride (NaCl)], and osmoprimed [thiourea (TU)]. polyethylene glycol (PEG) and proline (Pro)] by immersion at 18–22 °C for 12 h in the dark with continuous gentle stirring. The seed to solution ratio was 1:5 (w/v) (g/ml). After 12 h the seeds were then removed from the priming solution and rinsed thoroughly with sterilized water and dried again with forced air (using the oven drying method) for 24 h to achieve a moisture content closer to that of the pre-priming stage. The moisture content of the prepared seeds was reduced to 7% after 24 h of rapid drying at 20 °C. Unprimed seeds were used as controls and seeds were stored in sealed polythene bags. The experiments included the following treatments: NPS (No priming and salt stress) Halopriming with 25 mM, 50 mM, and 100 mM NaCl Priming with TU (Thiourea) 1 mM, 3 mM, and 5 mM Priming with Pro (Proline) 5 mM, 10 mM, and 20 mM Priming with PEG (Polyethylene glycol) 10%, 20%, and 30% The experiment was setup in a complete randomized design (CRD), with five replicates of each treatment with 10 seeds per plate. Primed and nonprimed seeds were placed in Petri dishes (90 × 120 mm) with double-layered sterile filter paper moistened with sterilized water, and germinated at 25 ± 2 °C for two days in a dark room. After 2 days, the Petri dishes were transferred to a climate-controlled chamber with a photoperiod of 16:8 (light/dark), 55% relative humidity, temperatures of 25 ± 2 °C, and 100 mM NaCl solution was added into each priming treated seeds except control. This NaCl concentration was determined based on the finding from preliminary experiments, which inhibited radicle length by approximately 50%. The salt stress was renewed every other day until the end of the experiment (10 days) to maintain the concentration of the treatment solution and the moisture of the filter papers was monitored every 24 h. Seed germination was recorded daily from the appearance of radicles even up to 2 mm. The schematic representation of the experimental setup for seed priming is shown inFig. 1. Schematic representation of seed priming. From each replicate, five seedlings were randomly selected after 10 days of germination to measure shoot and root length (SL and RL) with a standard ruler. Seedling fresh and dry weight, such as shoot fresh weight (SFW), root fresh weight (RFW), shoot dry weight (SDW), and root dry weight (RDW), were determined using analytical balances (Mettler- Toledo, India). The seedlings were dried in a hot air oven at a constant temperature of 72 °C for 48 h to estimate the dry weight. The following seedling metrics, such as germination potential (GP), germination rate (GR), vigor index (VI), and germination index (GI) were measured in 10-day-old seedlings as reported by Sun et al. (2012) [61] using the following formulas: 2.5. Estimation of photosynthetic attributes The amount of chlorophyll in the plant samples was determined using the method described by Arnon (1949) [62]. Fresh leaves (100 mg) were grounded in 80% acetone (v/v) and centrifuged for 10 min at 5000 rpm. The filtrate was used to quantify Chl a, Chl b, total chlorophyll, and carotenoid contents at 663 nm, 646 nm, 750 nm, and 470 nm, respectively. Protein analysis was performed using the coomassie brilliant blue (CBB) assay as described by Bradford (1976) [63]. The plant materials (1 gm) were gently homogenized in 0.1 M buffer solution (pH 7) using a pre-chilled pestle and mortar. The extract was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The filtrate was used to quantify protein content at 595 nm by UV-VIS spectrophotometer (Shimadzu 1900i). 2.7. Estimation of proline content The proline in plant samples was quantified spectrophotometrically at 520 nm using the method of Bates et al. (1973) [64]. The leaves (500 mg) of cauliflower seedlings were crushed in aq. sulfosalicylic acid (3%) and centrifugated at 10,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. After that, an aliquot of the filtrate was combined with glacial acetic acid in the acidic ninhydrin reagent and incubated at constant temperature (100 °C) for 1 h followed by cooling in an ice bath to terminate the reaction. The toluene was added to the mixture and vortexed for 30 s on a cyclomixer to obtain the proline containing toluene chromophore and the absorbance was measured using a spectrophotometer. 2.8. Estimation of MDA content The quantity of malonaldehyde (MDA) in the seedlings was determined using the method of Heath and Packer (1968) [65]to detect membrane lipid peroxidation. 500 mg plant tissue from each sample was homogenized in TCA 20% with 0.5% TBA. The extract was then heated at 100 °C for 1 h. After cooling on ice, the samples were centrifuged to clarify the solution. The spectrophotometric analysis of MDA was done by reading the absorbance at 532 nm and then at 600 nm to subtract the nonspecific absorption value. The MDA content was calculated using an extinction value of 155 mM−1cm−1. 2.9. Histochemical detections of H2O2 The leaves were incubated in 1 mg/ml DAB (3′3′- diaminobenzidine; pH 3.8) solution and kept at room temperature until a darker brown stain (produced by H2O2-DAB polymerization) appeared to visualize H2O2deposition in the tissues. Prior to visualization, the leaves were immersed in a freshly prepared bleaching solution (ethanol: acetic acid: glycerol) and kept in a hot water bath for 15 min followed by incubation in fresh bleaching solution at room temp. for 30 min to bleach chlorophyll. The statistical program SPSS (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA) was used for one-way ANOVA (analysis of variance) and all means within each variable were statistically determined using the Tukey HSD test at a probability level of 5%. The cluster analysis classifies all treatments according to their germination efficiency. OriginPro 2020 (OriginLab, Massachusetts, USA) was also used to create the heatmap and PCA to estimate the correlation coefficient between germination parameters. 3.1.

A relative value greater than 1 or less than 1 indicates that the trait is higher or lower than in the control. Different letters within a column indicate significant differences at p < 0.05. 3.3. The correlation coefficient among germination parameters The correlation coefficient analysis for different germination parameters depicted two distinct groupings with closely related characteristics (Fig. 3). RGP, RGR, RGI, and RVI belonged to one group, whereas RSFW, RRFW, RSDW, RRDW, RSL, and RRL, belonged to the other group with closely related features. Most germination traits exhibited statistically significant associations at the p < 0.01 level. The RGP was substantially linked with RVI, RRL, and RSL with correlation values of 0.72, 0.65, and 0.65, respectively. The RGI showed a correlation with RSL and RVI with correlation values of 0.63 and 0.81, respectively. A significant correlation was also found between RSL and RSDW having correlation values of 0.68 and 0.70, respectively. 3.4. Principal component analysis The influence of several priming agents onB. oleraceaL. var.botrytisgermination characteristics under salt stress was studied using principal component analysis (PCA). The components PC1 and PC2 explained 61.18% and 15.78% of the total variance, respectively (Fig. 4). The major impacts of different priming agents on germination traits were precisely scattered on the PC1 axis in the pattern of 20% PEG > 10% PEG> 3 mM TU> 5 mM TU> 30% PEG> 10 mM Proline> 50 mM NaCl> 20 mM Proline> 25 mM NaCl> 5 mM Proline> 1 mM TU> HP> 100 mM NaCl. The PEG treatments had greater PC1 scores and were clustered on the right side of the PC1 axis, meanwhile, the lower scoring treatments were majorly on the left. PCA revealed increased germination indices in PEG-treated seeds among all the priming treatments tested. Principle component analysis of germination traits for different seed priming treatments.

According to Ward's approach of systematic categorization, the 13 distinct priming treatments were classified into three groups in cluster analysis (Fig. 5). The 1 mM TU, HP, and 100 mM NaCl treatments were in the first group, and they had a smaller effect on seed germination under salt stress than the other treatments. The 20% PEG and 30% PEG treatments were in the second group, and they had the best effect on seed germination in salty circumstances. The third group, which included the 5 mM proline, 20 mM proline, 10 mM Proline, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM TU, 3 mM TU, 25 mM NaCl, and 10% PEG treatments, showed increased germination traits under salinity stress conditions, relatively to a lower extent. Dendrogram of seed priming treatments based on Y-values using Ward's method of systematic classification. 3.6. Effect of priming on protein, proline, and MDA content Priming has a significant impact on protein, proline, and MDA content in cauliflower seedlings (Fig. 6). The salinity stress gradually reduced the protein content with increasing salt concentration compared to the control. Among the different priming agents, TU showed a greater effect on increasing protein content (19.52%) in seedlings grown under salt stress than the control compared to all other priming treatments (Fig. 6B). It was observed that the proline content was increased in all priming treatments compared to unprimed seedlings. Seedlings growing only in salt conditions without a primer reduced protein content by 36.35% than control in comparison to all other treatments. Seedlings primed with proline have the proline content increased 2 to 3-fold in all primed treatment in compared to control has the lowest proline content (Fig. 6C). Priming has been shown to be an effective method to mitigate the stress-induced formation of MDA and reactive oxygen species. Lipid peroxidation indicated by MDA content was differentially reduced in a dose-dependent and priming agent-specific manner by application of the priming treatment compared to stressed seedlings (Fig. 6A). As a result, cauliflower seedlings derived from prepared seeds had greatly reduced MDA levels under salt stress conditions (Fig. 6A).

Salt stress can easily stuntBrassicagrowth, especially during germination. In this study, salt stress greatly reduced cauliflower germination as evidenced by reductions in germination potential, germination rate, germination index, and vigor index, and inhibition of seedling development. Under salt stress, seed germination can be suppressed or delayed for a variety of reasons. First, salinity significantly slows seedling growth and affects typical morphologies throughout the seedling stage by disrupting a number of vital fundamental cellular processes that alter the rate of emergence and growth, particularly in glycophytes [66]. Second, salt stress has been linked to ion toxicity and osmotic stress in cellular metabolic processes, resulting in lower turgor pressure due to increased negative water potential, both of which affect growth traits such as shoot root length, plant vigor, seedling growth, and biomass [[67],[68],[69],[70]]. Therefore, the main consequence of salt stress is a reduction in the cell division process, resulting in reduced development of the internodes, contributing to reduced growth and elongation of shoots, reduced leaf elongation, and rapid cell death [1,[71],[72],[73]]. Increasing salt tolerance and using appropriate management techniques to counteract the negative effects of salinity on salt-sensitive species is one of the most important and difficult management tasks [74]. Therefore, seed priming is the effective and ancient method to reduce the negative effects of various abiotic stresses [[75],[76],[77]]. Various priming techniques have been applied to seeds of many crops to help them overcome growth barriers and establish themselves more successfully in harsh climatic conditions [[78],[79],[80],[81],[82]]. Priming improves water uptake, causing the cell cycle in the G2 phase to proceed faster in pre-treated seeds than in non-pre-treated seeds, which can lead to cell synchronization [83], increased sugar content, organically producing compounds and modifying the Metabolic activities during seed germination and ultimately lead to uniform and better development of seedlings [84]. So pre-treating seeds with chemical agents, which create a moderate stress-like signal, permits the establishment of a “priming memory,” that improves tolerance when the plant is subjected to various abiotic stress in the future [85,86]. Ibrahim (2016) examined the benefits of seed priming in combating salt-induced lipid peroxidation and inhibition of MDA build-up (Ibrahim, 2016). MDA formation in prepared seedlings is hampered by the activation of both enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant mechanisms, as evidenced by maize research [96]. The first organelle to be altered by salt stress is the cell membrane, since polyunsaturated fatty acids are one of the membrane lipid components most susceptible to peroxidation during times of stress. Increased membrane permeability causes lipid peroxidation, which compromises membrane integrity [97]. Among the organic solutes, proline has been shown to maintain cellular osmotic potential, stabilize membranes, and detoxify toxic ions in salt-stressed plants [[98],[99],[100],[101]]. The accumulation of proline in salt-stressed plants was therefore considered as a predictive factor for salt tolerance. In the current study, the proline content in the untreated salt stress (NPS) control is higher than in the no-prime and no-stress (NPN) treatment control, but significantly lower than in primed treatments (Fig. 6C). All priming treatments on cauliflower seeds significantly improved proline accumulation with increasing concentration of the respective priming agents in the cauliflower seedlings grown under the salt stress regime (Fig. 6C). However, halopriming (NaCl priming) and proline priming proved very beneficial in terms of proline accumulation among all attempted priming treatments. However, the lowest level of proline was found in the case of hydropriming alone, although it was much greater than the unprimed and unstressed (NPN) control and was considerably similar to seedlings primed with lower concentrations of PEG and TU (Fig. 6C). In the present study, a reduction in Chl a, Chl b and total Chl was observed in the unprimed salt stressed (NPS) control, however, high chlorophyll content was found in the unprimed and unstressed (NPN) control (Fig. 7). Interestingly, all priming approaches mitigated the deleterious effects of salinity on chlorophyll and carotenoid levels, and significantly enhanced photosynthetic pigments (Fig. 7A–D). Proline priming proved to be much more beneficial for enhancing photosynthetic pigments than hydropriming alone. Halopriming was the least effective for pigment enhancement compared to other priming approaches in cauliflower. Salinity has a significant impact on all developmental traits. However, different treatments showed different responses to salinity sensitivity.Fig. 7showed that the hydroprimed and NaCl pre-treated seedlings had no significant difference in Chl b but increased Chl a and total Chl in the NaCl pre-treated seedlings. The amount of photosynthetic pigments in plant leaves is affected by increased concentrations of Na+and Cl−[113,114]. However, it has been discovered that as salinity increases, chlorophyll levels decrease. Salinity stress causes a reduction in chlorophyll concentration, which could be due to its negative effects on membrane integrity, decreased biosynthesis, or rapid pigment degradation [115,116]. It has also been observed that the long-term effects of salt cause the development of chlorophyll-protein-lipid complexes to be disrupted [117]. In the present study, seed primed with Pro, PEG and TU significantly increased total chlorophyll compared to hydropriming in salt stress (Fig. 7C). In the current investigation, proline priming significantly increased chlorophyll content, and proline treatment was also reported to favourably affect Chl a and total chlorophyll content in salt-stressedS. bicolor[118]. 5.
