Received 2016 Feb 9; Accepted 2016 Jun 2; Issue date 2016 Jul. Mathematical modeling coupled with direct measurement of Ca2+and ROS dynamics suggest that ROS-assisted calcium-induced calcium release propagates stress-induced Ca2+waves in plants. Plants possess a rapid systemic signaling network that enables whole-plant responses to localized stimuli. Examples include wounding (Miller et al., 2009), pathogen attack (Dempsey and Klessig, 2012), and osmotic shock (Christmann et al., 2007). The system(s) involved in the plant-wide propagation of these signals has been proposed to be mediated by a diverse set of molecular regulators, including changes in membrane potential and ion fluxes (Felle and Zimmermann, 2007;Zimmermann et al., 2009;Mousavi et al., 2013), hydraulics in the vasculature (Christmann et al., 2007;Farmer et al., 2014), and reactive oxygen species (ROS;Miller et al., 2009). A novel addition to this suite of systemic signals was described byChoi et al. (2014), in which a wave-like propagation of increased cytoplasmic Ca2+moved throughout the plant in response to localized salt stress. This signal propagated through the roots at a velocity of 396 ± 28 μm s−1and induced the expression of a range of stress-response genes in the leaves. Unlike systemic signals described previously, this Ca2+wave preferentially propagates through the root cortical and endodermal cells rather than the vasculature (Choi et al., 2014). Furthermore, the velocity of the signal is slower than the reported speed of 800 to 1,400 μm s−1seen with the other proposed systemic signals, such as theROSwave or electrical coupling (Miller et al., 2009;Mousavi et al., 2013). Table I. Calcium wave velocities in the various lines of Arabidopsis. TPC1in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) encodes the slow vacuolar (SV) channel (Hedrich and Neher, 1987;Peiter et al., 2005) that has been shown to be permeable to cations such as K+but also to Ca2+(Ward and Schroeder, 1994;Gradogna et al., 2009). TheSVchannel has been proposed to mediate Ca2+release from the vacuole (Ward and Schroeder, 1994;Allen and Sanders, 1996;Pottosin et al., 2009), although this idea has become controversial in recent years (Hedrich and Marten, 2011). The original electrophysiological characterization of theSVchannel showed that it could be modulated by Ca2+levels (Hedrich and Neher, 1987), and now structural and genetic analyses of the channel indicate the presence of Ca2+-binding EF hand domains on the cytosolic face of the channel that aid channel activation (Guo et al., 2016;Kintzer and Stroud, 2016; for review, seeHedrich and Marten, 2011), coupled with a novel Ca2+-sensitive regulatory domain on its vacuolar lumenal face that shifts the channel’s voltage activation toward more positive potentials as vacuolar Ca2+levels rise (Beyhl et al., 2009;Dadacz-Narloch et al., 2011;Guo et al., 2016). The recently published structure of TPC1 (Guo et al., 2016;Kintzer and Stroud, 2016) indicates several possible sites of phosphorylation offering further scope for regulation. Indeed,SVchannel activity is known to be regulated by a host of cytosolic factors (for review, seeHedrich and Marten, 2011). However, in general, the precise role of TPC1 in potentially mediating stress-induced Ca2+changes, and also which regulatory mechanisms may act to modulate TPC1 channel gating in such responses, remain unclear. For example, while some of the genetic components of the wave-like propagation of stress information by Ca2+(such as TPC1;Choi et al., 2014;Kiep et al., 2015) have been identified, the molecular mechanisms mediating the spread of this wave have yet to be fully elucidated. Therefore, we used mathematical models to provide insight into the possible modes to generate this wave and to produce testable predictions for empirical validation of these models. We conclude that a simple calcium-induced calcium-release (CICR) mechanism is unlikely. To support the speeds of wave transmission seen in vivo, we suggest that aROS-assistedCICRmechanism involving TPC1 andROSproduction by the NADPH oxidase Arabidopsis RESPIRATORY BURST OXIDASE HOMOLOG D (AtRBOHD) may be required. Models Based onCICRDo Not Recapitulate the Experimentally Determined Speed of Ca2+Wave Propagation under Physiological Conditions The experimental investigation ofChoi et al. (2014)highlighted a number of different Ca2+wave speeds in roots in response to chemical perturbations and in mutant lines of Arabidopsis in response to local NaCl stress application (Table I). For instance, increasing the abundance of TPC1 using a 35S promoter resulted in a significantly increased wave speed. Our approach to begin to dissect this system, therefore, has been to evaluate whether there are parameters for a mathematical model of Ca2+wave propagation that can reproduce the empirically determined wild-type velocity and whether those same parameters, but with an increased number of TPC1 channels, also can capture the speed in theTPC1overexpression line. Failure to do so would indicate that further elements and/or other mechanisms need to be considered in the model. This approach of testing whether a model is consistent with the available data has the advantage of not requiring experimental values for all parameters (which might be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to determine). Given the direct effect that TPC1 has on the propagation of the Ca2+wave, we first considered whether aCICRmechanism mediated by TPC1 could be involved. As discussed in the introduction, TPC1’s ability to directly mediate the release of vacuolar Ca2+is not clear (Hedrich and Marten, 2011), and its role could well be indirect. However, one key strength of the modeling strategy is that it does not make any statement about the identity of the channels responsible for mediating the release of Ca2+, just that it is dependent on TPC1 action. CICRcan be described mathematically through the fire-diffuse-fire model (Keizer et al., 1998;Ponce-Dawson et al., 1999;Timofeeva and Coombes, 2003;Coombes et al., 2004). This framework describes the process in which a quantity of Ca2+, σi, released through a channel at positionxiand at timetidiffuses through the cytosol and activates the next channel at positionxi+1. This mechanism has the capacity to create a wave of Ca2+that is regenerated each time a channel opens. Approximating wave propagation through roots as a one-dimensional system, the concentration of Ca2+,u(x,t), can be determined using the diffusion equation: whereDis the diffusion constant of Ca2+, σ is the release strength, and τRis the time for which the channel remains open. Channels are modeled as point sources that are characterized by Dirac delta functions, δ(x), in space and by the product of two Heaviside step functions,H(t), in time, to capture the open time. A channel at a position,xi, on the vacuole is assumed to open when the cytosolic Ca2+concentration at that position is greater than the threshold valueuc.This gating value represents the mathematical description of either the concentration-dependent binding kinetics of a ligand-gated channel or the requisite buildup of ionic charge needed to open a voltage-gated channel. We assume that the release of Ca2+from the vacuole occurs quickly compared with the time for diffusion between channels, so that we can treat a release as a point source in time (τR= 0). For a system of equally spaced channels with separationd, the velocity of the resulting wave is given byPearson and Ponce-Dawson (1998): Within a cell, the vacuole (with the ubiquitously expressed channel TPC1) typically occupies 50% to 90% of the interior volume (Macklon et al., 1996), whereas plasmodesmata, presumably lacking TPC1, connect cells, leading to two distinct regions for the propagation of the wave in the model (Fig. 1A). In the first, the Ca2+wave is propagated through the cytoplasm surrounding the vacuole. In the case of approximately equally distributed TPC1 channels on the tonoplast, the Ca2+wave has a velocity given by Equation 2. In the second region, the wave must move between neighboring cells. If the mechanism behind transmission in the cytoplasm is a self-propagating wave ofCICRmediated by TPC1, then presumably this mechanism will reduce to passive diffusion over a distancedv(the cell wall region) between the cytoplasm in adjacent cells through plasmodesmata. We assumed that this plasmodesmal coupling poses no obstacle to diffusion, so that the model has the best chance of propagating a wave at maximal speed. In this case, Ca2+moving from a cell takes a time,T, to activate the first TPC1 channel on the tonoplast of the neighboring cell. The concentration profile for a single release evaluated at the time of activation of the next channel (whenu=uc) then satisfies the expression We assume here that the activation of the first channel in the neighboring cell is dominated by Ca2+released from the closest channel in the previous cell. Within this model, the velocity of a Ca2+wave is determined by the velocities across these two regions. The spatial and temporal resolution of the experiments measuring these speeds (Choi et al., 2014) is insufficient to robustly distinguish transmission through each cell versus the cell-to-cell component crossingdv, even using the high spatial and temporal resolution afforded by confocal microscopy. Therefore, the transit speed between the two regions cannot be separated and so is averaged in the empirical measurements. For a cell of lengthL, this average speed is given by The time taken to cross the cell wall region (Eq. 3) and the velocity in the cytoplasm surrounding each vacuole region (Eq. 2) both depend on the parameter ratio σ/uc. This dependency implies that, in order to decrease the time spent crossing the cell wall region, the cell must change the release properties of the channels, but this has a corresponding effect on how quickly the wave crosses the cytoplasm in the vacuolar region. We used the measured velocity in the wild type, 395 μm s−1, the measured density of TPC1 channels in mesophyll cells,d= 1 μm (Pottosin and Schönknecht, 2007), and a commonly used value for the diffusion rate of Ca2+in the cytosol,D= 20 μm2s−1(Allbritton et al., 1992), to calculate an estimate for this unknown parameter ratio, σ/uc. We then used this value to determine if the model can recapitulate the velocity in the TPC1 overexpressor (oxTPC1), 679 ± 73 μm s−1(Choi et al., 2014). We see that the model can only recapitulate the velocity in the overexpressor whendvis sufficiently small. This result did not depend on our choice of diffusion constant (Supplemental Fig. S1A) but could be affected by changes in the channel separation,d(Supplemental Fig. S1B). Since our chosen value fordcame from TPC1 channel density data from mesophyll cells and the wave travels through the root, different expression levels of TPC1 could result in different densities of TPC1 on the vacuolar membrane. We tested for such potential differences with quantitative PCR (QPCR) analysis of roots and shoots dissected from plants grown as for the Ca2+imaging. This analysis showed no statistically significant difference between root and shoot expression in the wild type (Supplemental Fig. S2). In the overexpressor, shoots showed a 1.9-fold higher transcript level than the roots of the same plants, so any change in actual channel density between roots and shoots will likely be small. Thus, with such intervacuolar distances, Ca2+diffusion would not be sufficiently rapid to recapitulate experimentally determined wave speeds. We emphasize that this model has not included any kind of obstruction to diffusion that the plasmodesmata may produce, which would make the wave even slower. In summary, the range of distances in the literature together with our analysis suggest that it is unlikely that calcium release through a TPC1-dependentCICR-driven mechanism alone is responsible for propagating the observed signal. TPC1 Channel Clustering Does Not Explain Observed Ca2+Wave Propagation Speeds The analysis outlined above assumes that TPC1 is distributed uniformly across the vacuolar membrane. Clustering of signaling components may provide a mechanism for selective amplification and channeling of signals that could, in theory, contribute to increased signal propagation rates. Indeed, the observed distribution of channels (Peiter et al., 2005) suggests that TPC1 may show a degree of clustering. The distribution of random independent events on a fixed interval of space or time (such as the area of a membrane patch) follows a Poisson distribution (Riley et al., 1998), so if TPC1 channels were distributed randomly across the tonoplast, we would expect the patch clamp data ofPeiter et al. (2005), which monitor individual TPC1 channel gating in isolated tonoplast membrane patches, to obey a Poisson distribution. Clustering of TPC1 on the tonoplast reduces the efficiency ofCICR-mediated Ca2+wave transmission. A and B, Numbers of TPC1 channels observed in vacuolar membrane patches byPeiter et al. (2005; bars) compared with best-fit Poisson distributions (lines) for the wild type (A) and the TPC1 overexpressor (B). C, How the velocity of a Ca2+wave varies with increased clustering within theCICRmodel. The number of channels is kept constant as the number per cluster increases. Release strength, σ/uc, was chosen so the velocity with equally spaced channels matched the wild-type velocity (395 μm s−1). The dashed line shows the behavior predicted by Equation 5. Table II. Clustering of TPC1 channels. A χ2test of channel count data (Peiter et al., 2005) was performed under the null hypothesis that TPC1 channels are (uniform) randomly distributed To investigate the impact of channel clustering on the wave propagation speeds, we performed the following simulations. An initial wave was generated assuming equally spaced channels. Keeping the total number of channels the same, the number of channels in a cluster was increased (initially one channel per cluster with separationd, changing to two channels per cluster with separation 2d, and so on). We simulated the system with an array of 51 cells (as inFig. 1C) with alldvvalues the same and a cell length,L, of 100 μm. This analysis showed that the speed of the wave falls with increased clustering (Fig. 2). The optimal arrangement for most rapid signal propagation, therefore, is when channels are equally spaced. The expression for the wave velocity (Eq. 2) explains this decrease in velocity with increased clustering. Treating each cluster of channels as a single release site, with a release strength proportional to the number of channels in that cluster (Shuai and Jung, 2003), the effect of increasing the degree of clustering by a factor of 2, say, involves changing the channel separationd→d′ = 2dand the release strength σ → σ′ = 2σ (since we now have twice as many channels at a release site). The resulting velocityv′ is In the Ca2+diffusion model, an optimal distribution of equally spaced channels is unlikely to explain the speed of the observed Ca2+waves. An increase in clustering between the wild type and the TPC1 overexpressor would lead to less efficient signal propagation than the equally spaced channels and, therefore, an even worse fit. ROSProduction via RBOHD Is Sufficient to Activate Calcium Release and Wave Propagation at Observed Rates To explain the observed Ca2+wave speeds, we hypothesized thatROSmay have a role to play. Rapid propagation of a systemic increase inROSproduced by the NADPH oxidase AtRBOHD has been reported in response to stress signals (Torres et al., 2002;Miller et al., 2009;Zhang et al., 2009). RBOHD is expressed ubiquitously throughout Arabidopsis plants and is localized to the plasma membrane of cells (Sagi and Fluhr, 2006). It is responsible for the production ofROSsuch as hydrogen peroxide in the apoplast and is involved in a range of signaling processes, such as in defense (Torres et al., 2002) and in the opening and closing of stomata (Zhang et al., 2009). Furthermore, it has been shown to be essential to the propagation of theROSwaves byMiller et al. (2009). The RBOH family of proteins contain two EF hand calcium-binding domains as well as multiple potential phosphorylation sites, which enable their activation in response to raised cytosolic Ca2+(Sagi and Fluhr, 2006). Indeed, the dynamics of changes inROSand Ca2+also are known to interact in the processes ofROS-induced Ca2+release and Ca2+-inducedROSrelease (Gilroy et al., 2014). A conceptual model forROSwave propagation was produced byDubiella et al. (2013), where Ca2+acting via the calcium-dependent protein kinase family member 5 stimulatesROSproduction from the plasma membrane NADPH oxidase RBOHD andROSis able to trigger Ca2+influx across the plasma membrane into cells viaROS-regulated plasma membrane Ca2+channels (Richards et al., 2014). This provides a self-propagation mechanism in whichROStriggers plasma membrane Ca2+influx into the cell, potentially triggeringCICRvia TCP1 at the tonoplast. The cellular Ca2+rise in turn activates RBOHD, which then produces more apoplasticROS.ROScould potentially travel through the apoplast and trigger the same process in the neighboring cell. ThisROS-dependent model can be described mathematically to quantitatively analyze whether it is consistent with the observed stress-related Ca2+waves.ROS-inducedROSrelease can be described by Equation 1, whereuis now the concentration ofROSin the apoplast.ROSdoes not activate a neighboring RBOHD directly but via triggering increased Ca2+in the cytoplasm, which in turn activates RBOHD. The critical threshold parameterucincorporates the indirect nature and complexity of this activation process in one variable and so provides a mathematical means through which changes in Ca2+behavior can feed back onROSpropagation without needing to parameterize the detailed molecular mechanisms behind this process. If higher levels of Ca2+release are being maintained in a cell (e.g. because ofTPC1overexpression), then we would expect the RBOHDs to be activated more quickly, which can be represented in the model by a decreaseduc, irrespective of the precise molecular mechanism responsible for the Ca2+-dependent activation. ROSdiffusion in the apoplast may be predicted to be faster than that of Ca2+in the cytoplasm, as highly active cytoplasmic Ca2+buffering and sequestration mechanisms limit the cytoplasmic movement of this ion (Allbritton et al., 1992); although it is important to note that the levels ofROSin the cell wall also are thought to be tightly regulated by a balance between their generation systems andROS-scavenging mechanisms (Kärkönen and Kuchitsu, 2015). RBOHDs also exist at a higher density than TPC1 (Peiter et al., 2005;Hao et al., 2014). This puts the propagation of theROSwave into the continuous regime (Pearson and Ponce-Dawson, 1998); therefore, the velocity of theROS-assisted wave has a different functional form than from a purelyCICR-driven process, in which it propagates as a saltatory wave (Coombes et al., 2004): The wild-type velocity can be used to calculate the ratio of the unknown parameters. To test the model, we evaluated the velocity in the TPC1 overexpressor: Importantly for thisROS-assistedCICRmodel, we used the average value of channel density derived fromPeiter et al. (2005). This parameter is independent of the underlying distribution of TPC1, being derived from the total number of channels observed divided by the number of samples. For theROS-assisted model, only the number of TPC1 channels is used in the analysis, but as we demonstrated with the pureCICRmodel, clustering of TPC1 will tend to slow down wave propagation but is unlikely to affect the inferences drawn from the predictions. BlockingROSProduction withDPI, Ascorbate, and in the AtrbohD Knockout Validates Predictions of theROS-AssistedCICRModel To empirically test the prediction of aROS-assisted mechanism for Ca2+wave propagation, we attempted to dissect the involvement ofROSin the Ca2+wave by treating the root with theROSscavenger ascorbate and the NADPH oxidase inhibitorDPI. To separate the effects of these compounds on the ability of the plant to propagate the wave versus the ability to initially trigger a stress response, we initiated a Ca2+wave by locally treating the tip of the root with 100 mmNaCl in the absence of any inhibitor. The root system of Arabidopsis was growing through a Phytagel matrix, so the local treatment was applied by cutting an approximately 500-μm × 500-μm hole in the gel ahead of the root tip and letting the root apex grow into this window, which was subsequently filled with growth medium containing 100 mmNaCl. We had determined previously that this treatment localizes the salt stress to the very apex of the root and reproducibly triggers a Ca2+wave propagating shootward from the root apex (Choi et al., 2014). Either 25 to 100 μmpotassium ascorbate, 25 to 200 μmDPI, or growth medium (negative control) was applied locally 10 min prior to the root tip NaCl stimulation to a similar window cut into the gel surrounding the mature region of the root more than 1,000 μm shootward of the root tip. In all cases, the Ca2+wave propagated at approximately 400 μm s−1from the root tip to the region treated with inhibitor, but transit through the treatment region was altered depending on the pharmacological agent present. Calcium wave movement through the region treated with growth medium alone was maintained at 400 μm s−1. Treatment with 25 μmascorbate slowed wave propagation to 64 µm s−1, and detectable Ca2+changes were abolished with 100 μmascorbate pretreatment. Treatment with up to 200 μmDPIsignificantly attenuated the magnitude of the Ca2+increase and slowed propagation rates to 146 μm s−1(Table I;Fig. 3A). These observations are consistent with a requirement forROSand NADPH oxidase-mediatedROSproduction in Ca2+wave transmission. Furthermore, knockout ofAtRBOHDslowed propagation of the Ca2+wave to 73 μm s−1(Table I;Fig. 4;Supplemental Figs. S3 and S4). Imaging of the ExtracellularROSWave Using OxyBurst Green-Bovine Serum Albumin Consistent with the model ofROS-assistedCICR, theseROSincreases distal to the site of NaCl stimulation were dependent onAtRBOHDandTPC1, being attenuated inAtrbohDandtpc1-2mutants (Fig. 5B). TheROSincrease did not differ significantly (P> 0.05, ANOVA) from the wild-type response in theTPC1overexpression line (Fig. 5C). We have applied the fire-diffuse-fire model to explore the mechanisms behind the plant-wide transmission of stress-induced Ca2+waves, focusing on the salt-induced wave of the root. Our analyses suggest that a simpleCICR-based mechanism relying upon a self-reinforcing Ca2+release from the vacuole via TPC1-dependent Ca2+efflux and diffusion of Ca2+between cells is unlikely to account for the observed velocity of wave movement. Extending thisCICRmechanism for Ca2+wave transit through the cell with Ca2+-dependent apoplasticROSproduction to couple between cells, however, is able to support the observed velocities. ROShave been implicated repeatedly in systemic signaling (Alvarez et al., 1998;Karpinski et al., 1999;Miller et al., 2009;Suzuki et al., 2013), and while it is tempting to identify this and the Ca2+wave we have studied here as two sides of the same coin, there are important differences that have yet to be explained. First, theROSwave in response to wounding travels at 1,400 μm s−1(Miller et al., 2009), much faster than the Ca2+wave we studied here. This difference might be because the wound-inducedROSwave propagates through the vascular tissue, whereas the Ca2+wave appears to be restricted to the cortex and endodermis (Choi et al., 2014). The vasculature is well suited for long-distance transmission of signals (van Bel et al., 2014), particularly electrical signals. Alternatively, the triggering stimulus also may impact on propagation speed/mechanism. Indeed, the velocity of the wound-relatedROSwave is very similar to that of electrical responses to wounding (Mousavi et al., 2013), suggesting thatROSand electrical signals may act together in the wounding response (van Bel et al., 2014). It is striking, however, that the signal velocity in therbohDmutant is compromised in response to either salt stress (this study) or wounding (Miller et al., 2009), hinting at some possibly shared core components of the transmission machinery. Indeed, both the NaCl-triggered Ca2+wave propagation (Choi et al., 2014) and the wound-induced systemic Ca2+increases (Kiep et al., 2015) appear to be dependent on theTPC1, reinforcing the idea of conserved elements of the propagation system. The activity ofSVchannels is known to be inhibited byROSand activated by reducing agents (Carpaneto et al., 1999;Scholz-Starke et al., 2004;Pottosin et al., 2009), and this may at first sight appear contradictory to theROS/TPC1-related propagation mechanism modeled above. However, sinceROSis generated within the apoplast by RBOHDs, it would initially be able to rapidly gateROS-activated channels in the plasma membrane. TheROSwould then need to cross the plasma membrane and the cytoplasm before interacting with TPC1. It can take 0.9 s to develop a stable gradient ofROSacross plasma membranes (Bienert et al., 2006), although the maximum theoretical rate could be much faster (Vestergaard et al., 2012). Given the speed of the Ca2+wave in the wild type, it should take only approximately 2.5 ms (TPC1 channel separation over the wave speed) to activate each TPC1 in sequence; thus, it is unlikely that theROSwould have time to trigger a direct effect on TPC1’s ability to mediate the initial propagation phase of the Ca2+wave. The slowerROS-triggered inactivation of TPC1, therefore, may have an important role to play in terminating the wave once it has moved through the cell.ROS-based TPC1 inactivation also could lead to a refractory period where the channel is unable to support further Ca2+increases, leading to the wave-like progression of the Ca2+increase. Inherent to the model presented above is rapid triggering of TPC1 byROS-dependent cytosolic Ca2+increases. Although theSVchannel has long been identified as being activated by cytosolic Ca2+(Hedrich and Neher, 1987), large concentrations of Ca2+are required (Guo et al., 2016). The ability of theSVchannel to directly release Ca2+also is a topic of some controversy (Hedrich and Marten, 2011), as large vacuolar Ca2+concentrations inhibit the activation of TPC1 (Beyhl et al., 2009;Hedrich and Marten, 2011;Guo et al., 2016). TheSVchannel is known to be regulated by many other factors (for review, seeHedrich and Marten, 2011). For example, recent structural data have indicated a number of potential phosphorylation sites on TPC1 (Kintzer and Stroud, 2016), and the beet (Beta vulgaris)SVchannel is activated by calmodulin (Pottosin et al., 2009). Such alternative regulatory mechanisms provide a wide range of other means for the activation of this channel as part of the Ca2+wave transmission process. TPC1 also could be only indirectly responsible for the release of Ca2+from the vacuole, possibly by controlling changes in membrane voltage that activate other channels (Peiter, 2011). Our modeling approach does not make any assumptions about TPC1’s role in mediating Ca2+release, merely requiring that the activation of TPC1 leads to Ca2+release, whether directly or indirectly. The knockout ofTPC1that slows Ca2+wave transmission approximately 40-fold only delays the Ca2+response at the site of direct NaCl treatment by 30 s (Choi et al., 2014), suggesting that TPC1 may have a more pronounced role in transmission than in the initial direct stress response, consistent with the lack of an obvious Ca2+dynamics phenotype in response to stress intpc1-2when measured at the whole-plant level (Ranf et al., 2008). Conceptual model of the propagation of the salt stress-induced Ca2+/ROSwaves.ROS(green arrows) are produced in RBOHD (green circles) and diffuse through the apoplast, activatingROS-sensitive Ca2+channels in the plasma membrane (light blue ellipse). These channels release Ca2+into the cytosol (blue arrows) that activate TPC1 proteins (yellow circles), which, directly or indirectly, mediate Ca2+release from the vacuole. Combined, this Ca2+activates further RBOHD proteins, giving rise to a self-propagatingROS/Ca2+wave. Passage between cells may be mediated by either diffusion ofROSthrough the apoplast or Ca2+through the plasmodesmata. While the modeling work presented here assumesROSpropagation through the apoplast, we cannot exclude the possibility that Ca2+diffusing through the plasmodesmata is responsible for transmitting the signal between adjacent cells, or indeed that the two species act in tandem (Fig. 6). A TPC1-mediatedCICRwave acting alone seems unlikely, and that motivated us to look atROSpropagation, but the requirement for aROS-activated plasma membrane Ca2+channel means there also could be sources of Ca2+influx within the plasmodesmatal plasma membrane itself that could contribute to a rapid transmission event. Unfortunately, the resolution of current imaging techniques is unable to distinguish these possibilities. TPC1andAtRBOHDare expressed ubiquitously throughout the plant, so their distribution does not provide an obvious explanation for why the salt-induced Ca2+wave preferentially transits through the cortical and endodermal cell layers. Similarly, candidates for the putativeROS-activated Ca2+-release channels, such as annexins and SKOR (Garcia-Mata et al., 2010;Richards et al., 2014), also are expressed throughout the root (Birnbaum et al., 2003). Thus, identifying theROS-regulated channels involved with this signaling process, as well as other components that provide regulatory roles, represents a key challenge for the future that may provide important insights into the tissue-specific pattern of the Ca2+wave. Confocal ratio imaging was performed as described byChoi et al. (2014). Briefly, 7-d-old seedlings were grown as described above and imaged using a 20×/0.75 Plan-Apochromat objective on a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope, with 458-nm excitation, 458-nm primary dichroic, and 462- to 505-nm (CFP) and 526- to 537-nm (cpVenus/FRET) emission selected using the microscope’s Meta detector. Images were analyzed using the Image Calculator in the FIJI analysis package (Schindelin et al., 2012), and ratio data from the sequential confocal images were converted to a pseudocolored kymogram using MultiExperiment Viewer software version 10.2 (Saeed et al., 2003). Due to uncertainties in the applicability of in vitro calibration of this reporter to in vivo responsiveness, data are presented as raw ratios of YFP (cpVenus) to CFP signal intensities. Increasing YFP-CFP ratio signal represents an increase in Ca2+levels. Measuring ExtracellularROSwith OxyBurst Green-BSA ExtracellularROSproduction was measured essentially as described byMonshausen et al. (2009). A total of 200 µg mL−1OxyBurst Green (dihydro-2′,4,5,6,7,7′-hexafluorofluorescein)-BSA(Life Technologies) dissolved in growth medium was added to the root approximately 10 min prior to treatment at the root tip. A ROI of 50 × 50 µm was then imaged either 3,000 or 5,000 µm from the root tip using a 20×/0.75 Plan-Apochromat objective on a Zeiss LSM780 confocal microscope, using 458-nm primary dichroic, 458-nm excitation, and 526- to 537-nm emission using the microscope’s Meta detector. For inhibitor treatments, a small window (approximately 500 μm × 500 μm) was made in the gel in the middle region of the root, shootward of the root tip, using the tip of a syringe needle as a knife to carefully remove the gel using a dissecting microscope. Ten microliters of 25 to 200 μmDPI(NADPH oxidase inhibitor) or potassium ascorbate (ROSscavenger) made up in one-half-strength Epstein’s medium with 10 mmSuc was added to the gel window 30 min prior to salt treatment of the root tip. Control plants were treated similarly, but with 25 μL of one-half-strength Epstein’s medium with 10 mmSuc in the window. To prevent the gel from drying out, these samples were kept in a humid petri dish prior to confocal imaging. Total RNA Isolation and Quantitative Real-Time PCR Analysis ForQPCRanalysis, root and shoot samples of 6-d-old seedlings of wild-typeCol-0andoxTPC1were harvested in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was then isolated from 50- to 200-mg tissue samples using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) followed by removing residual genomic DNA using the TURBO DNase Kit (RNase-free DNase I; Ambion) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Total RNA (1–2 μg) was reverse transcribed into first-strand complementary DNA in a 40-µL reaction (25–50 ng total RNA µL−1) with ProtoScript II reverse transcriptase (New England Biolabs).QPCRanalysis was done using an Applied Biosystems 7500 Real Time PCR system, and analysis was performed with the 7500 Software version 2.3 (Applied Biosystems). The ArabidopsisUBQ10gene was used as an internal reference for standardization as described previously (Choi et al., 2014). First-strand complementary DNA proportional to 10 ng of genomic DNA-free starting total RNA was combined with 200 nmof each primer and 7.5 µL of 2× EvaGreenQPCRMaster Mix with ROX passive reference dye (Biotium) in a final volume of 15 µL.QPCRwas performed on a 96-well optical PCR plate (ABgene) using the following parameters: one cycle of 15 min at 95°C; 40 cycles of 20 s at 95°C, 30 s at 58°C, and 15 s at 65°C; and one cycle of dissociation from 58°C to 95°C with 0.5°C increments. Quantitation of the expression ofAtTPC1was calculated using the comparative threshold cycle method as described previously (Choi et al., 2014). TheQPCRprimers used are AtUBQ10-qPCR-F (UBQ10forward primer, 5′-CACACTCCACTTGGTCTTGCGT-3′), AtUBQ10-qPCR-R (UBQ10reverse primer, 5′-TGGTCTTTCCGGTGAGAGTCTTCA-3′), AtTPC1-qPCR-F(i) (TPC1forward primer, 5′-GCTCTATTGGCGTACAGGTCTTTG-3′), and AtTPC1-qPCR-R(j) (TPC1reverse primer, 5′-GAAGAGTGTGACCATTCCATTGG-3′). to a reference point at positionxand at timet. The total concentration is the sum of these terms over all Ca2+releases,i,. This method requires calculation of the firing times of all releases and, therefore, places an upper limit on the temporal step size of the algorithm. We typically used a step size Δt= 10−6s. Concentrations,c, were scaled by the firing threshold,uc,. Simulations were performed with code developed in C++ using the GNU science library root-finding function to fit the model to observed wave velocities.
