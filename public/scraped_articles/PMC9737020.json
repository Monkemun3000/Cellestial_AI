This article is an open access article distributed under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Megakaryocytes (MKs) are highly specialized precursor cells, residing in the bone marrow [1] and lungs [2], that produce and finally release platelets (PLTs) [3,4,5]. The development and maturation of MKs and the subsequent production of PLTs by MKs are tightly regulated and depend on external cues [6,7,8]. During the final stages of MK development, the cytoplasm is massively reorganized and long cytoplasmic extensions are formed, coined proplatelets [9]. Two cytoskeletal systems provide the force leading to the shape changes associated with MK maturation and proplatelet formation: actin filaments and microtubules assembled from tubulin subunits [10,11]. More specifically, it was demonstrated that dynein-dependent microtubule sliding acts as the driving force for proplatelet elongation and PLT biogenesis [11]. In this context, it is important to note that such processes are strictly dependent on sufficient availability of ATP as an energy source [12]. Once released into the circulation, PLTs impose as small, and anucleate cells. In the past, PLTs have traditionally been considered simple ‘sacs of glue’ with limited functionality beyond acute hemostasis due to the lack of a cell nucleus. However, in recent years, PLTs have been identified as dynamic effector cells bridging the inflammatory, immune, and hemostatic continuum [6,7,8,13,14,15,16]. One mechanism explaining the multitude of functional responses is that MKs are equipped to sense external stimuli that trigger differential expression and packaging of mRNA and proteins into their progeny, causing distinct PLT functional alterations, especially in disease [6,7,8,17,18,19,20,21]. Hence, although PLTs are anucleate, we found that the PLTs’ array of mRNAs is dynamic and can undergo active re-programming [8,17,18,19]. Furthermore, intricate processes regulate RNA processing, expression, and translational events [22,23,24,25,26,27,28] in PLTs. In concert with maintaining nuclear RNA processing capabilities, numerous studies have shown that PLTs possess nuclear proteins, such as the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-c, and retinoid X receptor (RXR) [29,30], and retinoic acid receptor (RAR) [28,31]. Sepsis is a common, and often morbid, syndrome which is characterized by systemic inflammation and dysregulated host immune responses triggered by invading pathogens or toxins (i.e., Toll-like receptor [TLR] agonists like LPS), frequently intensified by injurious agonists generated by the infected organism. The MK-PLT axis plays a major role in orchestrating sepsis-related thromboinflammatory and immunothrombotic events [7,32,33,34,35]. MKs were demonstrated to synergistically react to TLR 2/4 agonists in combination with thrombopoietin (TPO) signaling by increasing their proliferation, and thrombopoiesis [36]. However, this effect could only be observed in immature CD34+ cells, while MKs in the past 7 days of culture demonstrated slightly decreasing numbers when treated with LPS. Finally, PLT aggregation and the formation of heterotypic PLT-leukocyte aggregates in septic patients is associated with increased morbidity and mortality [37,38,39]. Nevertheless, the direct impact of PLTs in the pathobiology of sepsis remains incompletely understood. Furthermore, several cell biology aspects, and mechanistic insight into PLT and MK functions during septic events are still obscure. The purification and functional characterization of a 53 kDa protein facilitating nucleosome assembly in mammalian cells was first described in 1984 [40]. The NAP-family, including nucleosome assembly protein 1 like 1 (NAP1L1), is a group of proteins with chaperone function, capable of binding histones and coordinating their assemblance into nucleosomal particles [41]. Several additional binding partners for NAP-family members were identified, including transcription factors, proteins regulating nuclear import (karyopherins), and factors involved in cell cycle regulation (reviewed in [41]). Specifically, NAP1L1 was described to promote proliferation of pluripotent stem cells [42] through cell cycle interference. Furthermore, NAP1L1, in concert with NAP1L4, can act as a histone chaperone [43], and serving as a co-factor for ubiquitination client selection [44]. Furthermore, numerous studies describe NAP1L1 as a prognostic marker in select cancer entities (i.e., colon cancer [45], hepatocellular carcinoma [46], ovarian cancer [47], and lung cancer [48]), and its involvement in a number of signaling pathways, which were demonstrated to result in tumor progression. NAP1L1 mRNA expression in human PLTs was previously described [49]; however, no function was assigned to this versatile nuclear protein in such anucleate cells, or its progenitors, MKs. Here, we demonstrate that MKs and human PLTs endogenously express differential NAP1L1 mRNA variants and protein isoforms. We identified PDC-E2, a subunit of the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH complex), as a protein interaction partner. In PLTs, septic conditions induced increased expression of NAP1L1 protein, and PDH complex activity. In contrast, exogenous overexpression of NAP1L1 in MKs resulted in reduced proplatelet formation, and decreased PDH complex activity when treated with LPS, simulating a septic environment. Our findings suggest a previously unidentified NAP1L1 interaction partner in human PLTs and MKs. Furthermore, this newly described protein–protein interaction seems to influence PDH complex activity, with subsequent functional disturbances of these specialized cells. 2.1. CD34+-Derived MKs and Freshly Isolated Human PLTs Express NAP1L1 MKs and human PLTs express mRNA for NAP1L1.RNA-seq snapshots taken from the Integrated Genome Browser of theNAP1L1transcript in CD34+-derived MKs (A) and human PLTs (B) (representative for n = 3). The height on they-axis represents the relative accumulated number of reads spanning a particular sequence. The average of the read depths across all genomic coordinates within a transcript correlate to abundance of RNA expression.NAP1L1transcript regions are represented below the plots by thick (exon) and thin (intron) lines. (C) MKs at culture days 3, 5, 7, 10, and 14 were examined forNAP1L1expression by PCR. NT represents the reverse transcription (RT) reaction using no template, NE represents the RT reaction using no enzyme. Both controls were performed to control for contaminating nuclear DNA.Bottom,B2Mas a loading control. This figure is representative of 5 independent experiments. (D) RNA from freshly isolated PLTs at baseline was isolated andNAP1L1mRNA expression was evaluated by PCR. This figure is representative of 3 independent experiments. The -PCR lane shows the negative control for the PCR reaction, lanes labeled with M indicate the marker lane. MKs and human PLTs express NAP1L1 protein.(A) CD34+-derived MKs were placed on immobilized fibrinogen to induce proplatelet formation, fixed, and then incubated with an antibody against NAP1L1 (yellow, top right panel) or an IgG control, followed by co-staining for b-tubulin (magenta) and nuclei (40,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, DAPI, blue), as shown in the bottom panels. Scale bars = 20 µm. This figure is representative of n = 7 independent experiments. (B) NAP1L1 protein expression (green) in human PLTs. PLTs incubated with an IgG control antibody are shown (left, IgG). The bottom panels show the corresponding transmission images overlayed with the co-staining with WGA (red). Scale bars = 10 µm. This figure is representative of n = 6 independent experiments. (C) Immunoblot analysis of MK lysates (day 13 of culture) using the anti-NAP1L1 antibody. The cells were lysed, and proteins separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. NAP1L1 isoforms are highlighted by a red box. (D) Immunoblot analysis of PLT lysates using the anti-NAP1L1 antibody. The cells were lysed, and proteins separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis; however, the samples were split and processed in parallel in the absence (left) or presence (right) of an NAP1L1-quenching peptide. The presence of the blocking peptide prevents the detection of NAP1L1 with the anti-NAP1L1 antibody, demonstrating specificity for the three main NAP1L1 protein isoforms. Lanes labeled with M indicate the marker lane. (C,D), representative of 3 and 8 independent experiments, respectively. 2.2.

Co-IP proteins were probed using an anti-PDC-E2 antibody. The left lane shows proteins isolated after co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) using an anti-NAP1L1 antibody. The middle lane shows proteins isolated after co-IP with non-immunogenic, control IgG. The right lane shows proteins isolated after the use of protein-G beads only. Red box and yellow arrow mark PDC-E2 protein detected as being co-IP’ed using the anti-NAP1L1 antibody, indicating protein–protein interaction. This figure is representative of n = 3 independent experiments. PDC-E2—human mitochondrial dihydrolipoyllysine-residue acetyltransferase is the E2 component of the multi-enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). In nucleated cells, DLAT, the gene encoding PDC-E2, is part of the nuclear DNA, and upon translation, the protein needs to be transported to the inner mitochondria membrane. Here, the enzyme transfers acetyl groups to coenzyme A. In addition, PDC can also be present in the nucleus catalyzing histone acetylation [50,51]. In turn, PDC-E2 is also the key antigen in primary biliary cholangitis, a chronic liver disease with autoimmune component targeting intrahepatic bile duct lining cells [52,53]. 2.3. NAP1L1 and PDC-E2 Show Dynamic Expression Changes When PLTs Are Exposed to Septic Conditions NAP1L1 was previously assigned chaperone and transport functions, involving histone complexes [54,55], diacylglycerol kinase ζ [56], mtHsp70 [57]. Here, we add an additional interaction partner, PDC-E2, to the evolving functional repertoire of NAP1L1. With PDC-E2 being an integral part of the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, we started exploring functional consequences of the NAP1L1–PDC-E2 interaction. Several studies demonstrated that the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex gets dysregulated due to septic host environment [58,59]. Although anucleate, emerging data demonstrates that the human PLT transcriptome is not static. Rather, the PLT transcriptome is dynamic and markedly altered during systemic inflammatory diseases [6,7,22,26]. Therefore, we sought to examine NAP1L1 and PDC-E2 protein expression levels in human PLTs isolated from septic patients. NAP1L1 shows dynamic protein expression changes when PLTs are exposed to septic conditions.PLTs were isolated from healthy individuals or septic patients within 48 h of ICU admission. (A) Total RNA was isolated and next generation RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed (n = 9, and 17, for septic and healthy, respectively). Data show the RPKM expression for NAP1L1 for healthy (grey), and septic (non-filled) samples. Analyzed usingt-test,p= 0.0001. (B) PLTs were fixed in suspension immediately after isolation. Immunofluorescence staining with an anti-NAP1L1 (green) antibody demonstrates robust expression of NAP1L1 protein in PLTs from septic patients and healthy PLTs (scale bars: 10 µm). Cells were co-stained using WGA (red). This figure is representative of n = 6 independent experiments. (C) Micrographs were analyzed using CellProfiler. The bar graph displays the mean intensity over all stained cells for NAP1L1, normalized to IgG. Analyzed usingt-test,p= 0.0505. (D) PLTs from healthy individuals and septic patients were isolated.

Analyzed usingt-test,p= 0.0278. 2.4. Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex Activity Is Increased in PLTs during Sepsis 2.5. NAP1L1 Overexpression in MKs Induced Reduced Proplatelet Formation (PPF) To further establish potential functional consequences of the newly described NAP1L1–PDC-E2 protein interaction, we utilized an established CD34+-derived human MK cell culture model [23,24,31,60]. The MK-PLT axis is increasingly recognized as being more intricate and sophisticated in cellular responsibilities and abilities than historically expected. MKs are not only producing PLTs in the bone marrow through thrombopoiesis but are also intimately involved in setting up the PLT immune potential. MKs invest PLTs with the molecular composition to take center stage as responders and immune sentinels in the initiation and propagation of coordinated host immune responses [64]. Furthermore, while PLTs are anucleate, it has been demonstrated that they contain a complex transcriptome [20,49] and regulatory pathways, including cytoplasmic splicing, controlling important biologic tasks [22,23,24,26,27,28,60,65,66,67]. In concert with these signal-dependent pathways, it was demonstrated that PLTs possess nuclear proteins. In a comprehensive PLT proteome analysis, 13% of all identified proteins were mapped to a nuclear location [68]. PLTs utilize such proteins in established functions, as well as assigning alternative roles. Amongst other nuclear proteins, MKs distribute a functional spliceosome to PLTs [23,24]. In addition, nuclear receptors, including the receptors for sex steroids, glucocorticoids, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR)s, and retinoid X receptors (RXR)s were detected in PLTs, reported to bind their respective ligands, which induce PLT aggregation and activation (reviewed in [69]). Unexpectedly, RAR was also demonstrated to be utilized by PLTs as a translational regulator [28]. RAR is additionally employed in non-genomic activities by controlling actin cytoskeletal events [31]. Nevertheless, there is paucity of data exploring and finally comparing the functional capacities of nuclear proteins in PLTs with their counterparts residing in MKs. The presented study was data driven and performed under best research practice. Nevertheless, there are some limitations to this study. Since the generation of the presented data, CRISPR-Cas9 technique has been developed for rapid genetic manipulation of MKs [62]. For future studies we would propose to use such an approach for further dissecting the mechanistic function of PDC-E2 in MKs in greater detail. We appreciate the descriptive character of our study; however, this is the first report of NAP1L1 interacting specifically with a previously unrecognized partner protein. Therefore, we recognize that our findings should be extended in future studies, potentially complemented by in vivo work using relevant mouse models. The following reagents and antibodies were used for microscopy, Western blot, and co-IP studies as described below: Paraformaldehyde (PFA 4% [2% final]), Alexa Fluor® 555 conjugate of wheat germ agglutinin (WGA, 1:1000; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA,W32464), Alexa Fluor® 647 conjugate of phalloidin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A22287), 4′,6-Diamidino-2-Phenylindole, Dihydrochloride (DAPI, Thermo Fisher Scientific, D1306), mouse anti-NAP1L1 antibody (abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA, ab58677), rabbit anti-NAP1L1 (abcam, ab33076), rabbit anti-Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex component E2 (PDC-E2, ODP2; abcam, ab 66511), rabbit anti-beta tubulin (abcam, ab232361), mouse anti-tubulin (MilliporeSigma, Billerica, MA, USA, T-5293), mouse anti-ACTB/actin HRP-conjugated (abcam, ab20272), and NAP1L1 blocking peptide (abcam, ab22418). Secondary HRP-conjugated antibodies, and secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor® 488 and 546 were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific (G-21040, G-21234,S11223, A-11001, A-11008, A-21422, A-21428). Patients were selected for meeting consensus criteria for sepsis [94], and enrolled within 48 h of ICU admission (n = 9, and 17, for septic and healthy, respectively). 4.3. PLT Isolation and Culture PLTs used for the described studies were freshly isolated. PLTs were leukocyte-reduced and isolated, as previously described to yield a highly purified population of cells with <1 leukocyte per 107PLTs [23,24,66]. In addition, PLT activation during centrifugation steps was mitigated by the addition of 100 nM prostaglandin E1 (PGE-1) before each centrifugation step. Depleted PLTs were resuspended at 1 × 108/mL in a serum-free M199 medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 11150067), placed in round-bottom polypropylene tubes, and incubated, where indicated, in a 37 °C humidified incubator at 5% CO2for different time points. In select studies, PLTs were placed on immobilized fibrinogen and stimulated with thrombin (factor IIa), as previously described [24]. CD34+hematopoietic progenitor cells were isolated from human umbilical cord blood and differentiated into proplatelet-producing MKs, as previously described [23,24,31]. MKs or PLTs were lysed in TRIzol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 15596026), and RNA isolation was performed, as previously described [23,24]. All RNA samples were DNase treated using the TURBO DNA-free Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, AM 1907) per manufacturer’s protocol. 4.6. Next Generation RNA-Sequencing For next-generation RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), 1 × 109isolated PLTs were carefully lysed in TRIzol and DNase treated, as described above. Total RNA was isolated, as previously described [22,25,31,49,95]. An Agilent bio-analyzer 2100 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) was used to quantify the amount and quality of the total RNA. RNA Integrity Number (RIN) scores were similar between all samples. RNA-seq libraries were prepared with TruSeq V2 with oligo-dT selection (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA, RS-122-2001). Reads were aligned (Novoalign) to the reference genome at the time of these studies (GRCh37/hg19) and a pseudo-transcriptome containing splice junctions. The Deseq2 analysis package was used to assign reads to composite transcripts (one per gene) and quantitate reads per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads/RPKMs. To determineNAP1L1mRNA expression pattern in human PLTs and CD34+-derived MKs, primers spanning exon 8–10 (248 bp product) ofNAP1L1(NAP1L1_1012_forward 5′-AGT GAA GTT CTC AGA TGC TGG-3′ and NAP1L1_1259_reverse 5′-CAC GTC CCT TGT GTT TCT GC-3′) and primers spanning exon 1/2–7/8 (588 bp and 399 bp products) ofNAP1L1(NAP1L1_460_forward 5′-AGT CGC CGA TAT TTG GAG TTC T-3′ and NAP1L1_1047_reverse 5′-TCC TGA ACC ATA TCA CTG AGC A-3′) were used (in-house synthesis) and PCR was performed. Loading control primers detectingB2MmRNA were used on paralleling samples (B2M_34_forward 5′-AGC TGA CAG CAT TCG GGC-3′ and B2M_333_reverse GTG GGG GTG AAT TCA GTG TAG T-3′). Annealing temperatures were selected as follows: primers spanning exon 8–10 ofNAP1L1, 60 °C; primers spanning exon 1/2–7/8 ofNAP1L1, 58 °C; primers detectingB2M,57 °C. Freshly isolated PLTs were fixed in suspension using PFA, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, AC327372500) for 5 min at room temperature (RT) and subsequently layered onto VECTABONDTM(Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA, SP1800) coated coverslips using a cytospin centrifuge (Shandon Cytospin, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were incubated with IgG (to control for specificity of signal) or an antibody against NAP1L1 overnight at 4 °C. Cells were subsequently incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor®488 or 546. Sialic acids/glycoproteins (in cell membranes/granular content) were co-stained using WGA. 4.9. Microscopy and Image Analysis 4.10. Protein Expression Studies All samples were normalized for starting cell concentrations. PLTs were lysed in Laemmli-buffer, and samples were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and examined by western analysis for NAP1L1 or PDC-E2/ODP2 expression patterns. Subsequently, proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Thermo Fisher Scientific, 32132). Linear range of detection was assured by using the saturation detection mode of the myECL Imager (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). For select studies a peptide competition assay was performed. In brief, a PVDF membrane loaded equally was split in half, and probed using anti-NAP1L1 antibodies pre-incubated with or without specific NAP1L1 peptide fragment (blocking peptide; incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in blocking buffer (TBS, Tween, non-fat dry milk)). Specific protein expression was normalized using ACTB/actin or b-tubulin expression and quantified using ImageJ (NIH). 4.11. Co-Immunoprecipitation Studies For all modified protein co-IP studies, the Universal Magnetic Co-IP Kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA, USA, 54002) was used according to the manufacturer’s protocol; however, magnetic beads were replaced using protein G magnetic beads specifically suited for immunoprecipitation (Dynabeads; Thermo Fisher Scientific, 10003D). In brief, 2 × 109total PLTs, or MKs were first pelleted and washed in PBS supplemented with phosphatase and deacetylase inhibitors. Cells were then lysed in 300 µL of the provided whole-cell lysis buffer and an additional protease inhibitor cocktail supplied by the manufacturer. The magnetic beads used for the IP reaction were either incubated with the antibody of interest (anti-NAP1L1) or the respective IgG control for 30 min at RT. Co-IP was performed using the prepared beads, the supplied buffer and the PLT cell lysate from 0.6 × 109PLTs or MKs with constant rotation for 4 h at 4 °C. The IP complexes were isolated and cleaned by placing the samples on a magnetic stand and performing repeated washes with the provided wash-buffer. Finally, each bead pellet was resuspended in 20 µL of Laemmli-buffer and heated to 99 °C for 3 min before being separated using SDS-PAGE or Western blot techniques, as described above. For mass spectrometry purposes, gels were directly stained using standard MS-compatible silver staining. 4.14. NAP1L1 In Vitro Transcription NAP1L1 was in vitro transcribed using a commercially available NAP1L1 expression plasmid (Origene, Rockville, MD, USA, RC201851) containing a T7 promotor for seamless in vitro transcription reactions. The linearized plasmid template, using the Pme I restriction site, was introduced into the in vitro transcription reaction (Thermo Fisher Scientific, AM 1345). The selected in vitro transcription kit, mMESSAGE mMACHINE™ T7 ULTRA Transcription Kit, was optimized to synthesize large amounts of efficiently and correctly capped mRNA, including a final poly(A) tailing step. The final mRNA product was subsequently isolated and purified using the MEGAclear kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, AM 1908), and stored at −80 °C until used for transfection reactions. 4.15. NAP1L1 Transfection and Overexpression CD34+-derived MKs were transfected on day 12 of the culture and were placed on immobilized fibrinogen on day 14 to induce proplatelet formation. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine™ MessengerMAX™ Transfection Reagent per the manufacturer’s standard protocol. In brief, MKs on day 12 of the culture and differentiation course were used for the experiment. MesengerMAX reagent was diluted in Opti-MEM Medium (1:16.6). Next, mRNA master mixes were prepared by adding 1 µg of in vitro transcribed capped and poly(A)-tailed NAP1L1 mRNA, or its vehicle to 25 µL Opti-MEM Medium. The diluted mRNA was subsequently added to the dilute MessengerMAX, as prepared above, and incubated for 5 min. at room temperature. Transfection mixes were added to cells and incubated over night at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells were treated overnight with LPS 100 ng/mL or its vehicle, lysed in Laemmli-buffer, and samples were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and examined by western analysis for NAP1L1 over-expression patterns. 4.16. Proplatelet Formation Assay On day 13, the proplatelet forming (PPF) MK, defined as displaying at least one filamentous pseudopod, were scored by microscopy blinded as to experimental group, as previously described [17]. The percentage of PPF MK was calculated as the number of PPF MK compared to the total number of round cultured cells analyzed. An average of 200 cells were counted per condition. We thank Chris K.
