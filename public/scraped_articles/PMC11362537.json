The ISS rodent habitat has provided crucial insights into the impact of spaceflight on mammals, inducing symptoms characteristic of liver disease, insulin resistance, osteopenia, and myopathy. Although these physiological responses can involve the microbiome on Earth, host-microbiota interactions during spaceflight are still being elucidated. We explore murine gut microbiota and host gene expression in the colon and liver after 29 and 56 days of spaceflight using multiomics. Metagenomics revealed significant changes in 44 microbiome species, including relative reductions in bile acid and butyrate metabolising bacteria likeExtibacter murisandDysosmobacter welbionis. Functional prediction indicate over-representation of fatty acid and bile acid metabolism, extracellular matrix interactions, and antibiotic resistance genes. Host gene expression described corresponding changes to bile acid and energy metabolism, and immune suppression. These changes imply that interactions at the host-gut microbiome interface contribute to spaceflight pathology and that these interactions might critically influence human health and long-duration spaceflight feasibility. Subject terms:Microbial communities, Microbial genetics, Metagenomics, Microbiota The International Space Exploration Coordination Group, representing 27 of Earth’s space agencies, has outlined a clear target for a crewed mission to Mars in the Global Exploration Roadmap1,2, and sustainable long-term lunar exploration as a platform to develop the capabilities necessary to enable this ambitious goal. These guiding objectives have driven development of the imminent commercial low Earth orbit (LEO) destinations and Gateway, and the Artemis mission goal of a permanent lunar surface habitat by the early 2030 s3. Major challenges associated to longer duration spaceflight and habitation off-Earth are identified in the NASA Moon to Mars Objectives4, including the goal to advance understanding of how biology responds to the Moon, Mars, and deep space to support safe human space missions. Consistently observed spaceflight-associated pathologies, notably disrupted glucose metabolism characterised by insulin resistance and lipid metabolism dysregulation, pose significant risks to astronaut health5,6. Research in tissue culture using the high aspect ratio vessel simulated microgravity model system developed at the NASA Johnson Space Centre characterised increases in pancreatic production of α-TNF, which increased insulin resistance and decreased glucose utilisation in adipocytes7. In mice, a reduction of insulin sensitivity has been observed after microgravity simulation using hindlimb unloading8. This is reflected in the muscle transcriptome after spaceflight, where insulin receptor signalling is suggestive of disrupted glucose homoeostasis9. Similarly, simulated microgravity on human oligodendrocyte10and mesenchymal stem11cell cultures increases production of fatty acids and complex lipids. In the nematodeCaenorhabditis elegans, the intestinal lipid metabolic sensors SBP-1 and MDT-15 respond to simulated microgravity, with RNAi knockdown ofsbp-1andmdt-15reducing lipid toxicity12. Spaceflight metabolic studies from the Bion space program (Kosmos 605, 690, 782, 936 and 1887 (1973-87))13–15characterised rats as hyperlipidemic, with spaceflight inducing elevated serum or hepatic fatty acids, and substantial increases in cholesterol (67%). Similar lipid dysregulation, suggestive of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NFALD), has been a consistently observed mammalian response to spaceflight alongside aligned disruption of insulin metabolism and glucose homoeostasis16–20. These observations in mice and humans on the ISS include widespread changes in the hepatic proteins which drive lipid metabolism, significant increases in steatosis, cholesterol and low-density lipids and reduced high-density lipids. The immune system can be compromised by spaceflight, both in space and after return to Earth. Despite quarantine before flight, infection with influenza andPseudomonas aeruginosahave been observed in astronauts21. Up to 50% of astronauts also exhibit immunodeficiency upon returning to Earth22, leaving them vulnerable to infection. This dysregulation manifests through decreased T cell and B cell abundance23, and impaired natural killer cell and macrophage function24,25. The underlying cause of these changes are thought to be driven by microgravity, isolation, and stress associated with spaceflight26, as well as shifts in the gut microbiome27. On Earth, comparable changes in muscle integrity, glucose homoeostasis, lipid metabolism, immune and psychophysiological function have been associated to gut microbiota28–32. Similarly, unique built environment surface microbiology arises from long-duration confinement, reshaping the bidirectional exchanges between usually diverse environmental microbial ecosystems and the gut microbiome to promote opportunistic pathogenicity33–37. Given the potential involvement of gut microbiota in spaceflight pathology, and their essential role in mediating healthy human metabolic function on Earth, there has been increasing research into gut microbiome dynamics associated with spaceflight. Using 16 S ribosomal RNA gene (16 S rRNA) amplicon sequencing, Jiang et al.38identified significant changes in the relative abundance of 16 OTUs in the gut microbiome of mice in Rodent Research (RR) 1 (RR-1) mission, some of which were annotated as within the generaStaphylococcusandTyzzerella, and were lower in mice after spaceflight compared to ground controls. More recently, Bedree et al.39explored the gut microbiome of BALB/c mice flown in the RR-5 mission using 16 S rRNA amplicon sequencing and reference-based whole metagenome sequencing (WMS). Amplicon analysis identified 14 ASVs as different in relative abundance (p<0.1) between spaceflight (ISS) and ground controls after 9 weeks of spaceflight, including increases in the generaClostridium,Romboutsia,Ruminiclostridium, andShuttleworthia, and decreases inHungatella, while WMS identified significant enrichment ofDoreasp. and the speciesLactobacillus murinus. In this study, species-resolved 16 S rRNA amplicon sequencing and de novo co-assembled WMS were employed to capture metagenomic changes in the murine gut microbiome associated with spaceflight across multiple samples as part of the RR-6 mission (Fig.1). Intestinal and hepatic transcriptomics were then used to assess the associated gene expression response of mice to spaceflight. AAnalysis design of data from the Rodent Research 6 mission andBmultiomic data analysis strategy. Figure created with BioRender.com. Spaceflight increased total body weight Spaceflight alters murine gut microbiota Insulin resistance and lipid accumulation are common spaceflight phenotypes45which are influenced by short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and can be improved through butyrate dietary interventions in ground-based murine studies46,47. As butyrate and other SCFAs are predominantly produced by bacteria within the gut48, alterations in RR6 gut microbiome composition were explored. Characterisation of microbiota used 16 S rRNA amplicon sequencing as well as WMS sequencing from faecal samples collected from GC_LAR and FLT_LAR (after 29 days of spaceflight) as well as GC_ISS and FLT_ISS mice (after 56 days of spaceflight). Fig. 2. Ground control, live animal return and ISS murine gut microbiome capture. Significant spaceflight microbiome changes are associated with short-chain fatty acid metabolism, bile acid conversion and pathogenicity Fig. 3. Spaceflight-associated significant microbiome alterations. D. welbioniswas recently characterised by Roy et al.51,52as a butyrate producer likely present in the gut of most humans and was negatively correlated with BMI in obese individuals with metabolic syndrome. The same team used murine supplementation experiments to illustrate thatD. welbioniscould partially counteract insulin resistance, adipose tissue hypertrophy and inflammation as well as suggest a potential association with mitochondrial content and activity in adipose tissue after high fat diet induction of obesity52. In mice, changes in microbially produced butyrate are also know to directly influence expression of hepatic circadian clock regulating genes, such asPer2andBmal1, in a bidirectional interaction which can disrupt host metabolism53. Enrichment ofD. welbionisin both groups of spaceflight mice (Fig.3A, B, I, J) compared to their respective ground controls here is therefore noteworthy given the high lipid accumulation, liver and mitochondrial dysfunction phenotype repeatedly observed in rodent research missions and astronauts17,18,45. Whether the relative increase of this species might be counteracting or contributing towards spaceflight pathology is unclear and merits further study. Conversely, other butyrate producers, such asIntestinimonas butyriciproducens54, were depleted after 29 days of spaceflight. L. murinusandAcutalibacter muriswere depleted in mice during spaceflight (Fig.3A, I), as well as someEnteroclosterspecies after 29 days of spaceflight, which can have high expression of bile salt hydrolases (BSHs), able to deconjugate bile salts into less toxic bile acids, and can promote microbially mediated 7α-dehydroxylation of host primary bile acids into secondary bile acids55–59. Conversion of the major human primary bile acids in humans, cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), to the secondary BAs deoxycholic acid (DCA) and lithocholic acid (LCA), is mediated by a limited number of closely related clostridia containing the bile acid inducible (bai) operon, such asClostridium scindens60,61which was significantly reduced in abundance after spaceflight (Fig.3I, J). The major murine primary bile acids also include α- and β-muricholic acid (αMCA and βMCA), which are transformed by 7α-dehydroxylation to murideoxycholic acid (MDCA). E. muris, which significantly increased in both spaceflight groups of mice compared to ground controls (Fig.3A, B, I, J), has been recently characterised as 7α-dehydroxylating in mice62, containing the bile acid inducible operons BaiBCDEFGI and BaiJKL, and BaiA, homologous toClostridium scindens. The Bai operon enablesE. murisandC. scindensto increase concentrations of 7α-dehydroxylated secondary BAs that alter the host bile acid pool and act as ligands to bile acid receptors to influence host inflammation, glucose and lipid metabolism62–66. For example, bile sensor farnesoid-X-receptor (FXR) modulates enterohepatic recirculation and host cholesterol metabolism through bile acid regulation ofcyp7A166. Similarly, secondary bile acids such as DCA and LCA are potent agonists of the bile acid receptor TGR5, which controls glucose homoeostasis in adipose tissue and muscle by altering intestinal cell release of the insulin secretion regulator glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)67–69. Liver production of α-MCA and β-MCA (in mice) is mediated bycyp2c70genes70,71but 7α/β-dehydroxylation mediated by microbes such asE.muriscan modify MCAs after epimerization into HDCA72, and critically regulate lipid metabolism73,74. Interestingly,E. clostridioformis, significantly higher in relative abundance after both 29 and 56 days of spaceflight (Fig.3), is reported as increasing in the presence ofE. muris62and harbours 7α/β hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (HSDH)59,75, which can also transform primary and secondary BAs into oxo-bile acids64. This agrees with findings from the RR-5 mission39, which found significantly increased levels of serum choline in mice after spaceflight, suggesting a broad impact on lipid metabolism. Immune suppression has previously been described as a response to spacefight76and could result as bile acid dysregulation77,78. So increased relative abundance ofC. difficileafter both 29 and 56 days of spaceflight is of potential concern if toxigenic. Changes in spaceflight associated metagenome functional prediction Fig. 4. Metagenomic functional prediction. Spaceflight alters host intestinal gene expression Faecal or serum fatty acid or bile acid concentrations were not measured within the Rodent Research 6 mission; however, host colon and liver gene expression were assessed from all four groups of mice, allowing host responses to spaceflight at the host-gut microbiome interface to be investigated. Fig. 5. Microbiome-host interface: spaceflight alters colon gene expression. Intestinal bile acid and circadian rhythm gene expression Significant microbiome alteration in some of the few well-characterised 7α-dehydroxylating bacterial species, including increases inE. murisafter 29 days and 56 days of spaceflight (below detection in ground controls) as well as depletion ofC. scindens, suggests secondary bile acid production and the bile acid pool is likely altered in the murine gut during spaceflight. In the host intestine, bile acids are passively absorbed or actively taken up through the apical membrane by the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter, ASBT (Slc10A2), bound to the cytosolic ileal bile acid binding protein, IBABP (Fabp6), and then transported across the basolateral membrane by organic solute transporters, Ostα and Ostβ (Slc51AandSlc51B), or glucuronidated by UGTs (such asUgt1a1)and exported back to the lumen by multidrug resistance-associated protein 2, MRP2 (Abcc2transporter)80,81. Increases in intestinal bile acid also activate the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and retinoid X receptor α (RXRα) heterodimer which regulates production and secretion of fibroblast growth factorFGF15/19, the negative feedback hormone which travels through portal circulation to bind hepatic FGFR4 receptors which suppress liver bile acid biosynthesis via inhibition ofCyp7A182. Intestinal extracellular matrix remodelling and immune compromise during spaceflight These expression profiles, alongside consistent downregulation of genes within the Intestinal IgA pathway (Fig.5H), suggest suppression of immunity and widespread tissue remodelling at the host-gut microbiome interface in mice after spaceflight. This agrees with reports of reduced cytokine production in mice after simulated microgravity117, immune dysfunction in splenic tissue of mice after 13 days of spaceflight on the Space Shuttle Atlantis118and in astronauts, alongside increases in plasma cortisol concentration which reached Cushing syndrome levels, during spaceflight119. Taken together, this provides an insight into the role the host-gut-microbiome interface might play in the current broad consensus of immune dysregulation in spaceflight environments120. Spaceflight alters gene expression in the liver Fig. 6. Microbiome-host metabolism: spaceflight alters liver gene expression. Bile acid disruption underlies hepatic cholesterol accumulation Hepatic energy homoeostasis disruption after spaceflight A challenge for biological experimentation conducted in space is low replication, compared to model studies using mice on Earth. An important associated shortfall of this research is the lack of assessment of inter-cage variation. The commonalities between LAR and ISS mice groups and use of distinct metagenomic methodologies, 16 S rRNA gene barcoding and co-assembled WMS, helped provide some biological and technical confidence in the spaceflight-associated changes in microbiome species detected here; however, it is likely that low n reduced statistical power and that important microbiome associations were missed, particularly those of low abundance bacteria. It is important that the imminent commercial low Earth orbit destinations (CLDs), Gateway, and Lunar Base Camp increase the capacity of their experimental habitats and growth facilities to support replicate numbers for multiomic science, in order to maximise discoveries and enable future interventional microbiome studies. This research also lacked truly independent cohorts of mice, as Liver Animal Return (29 days spaceflight) and ISS (56 days spaceflight), and their respective ground controls, derived from the same initial cohort of mice. Future studies should ensure common data gathering approaches to enable high resolution multiomic data to be directly compared across missions and different cohorts of mice. Integration of metagenomic and host transcriptomic data here provided a highly complementary picture of the multiomic response to spaceflight, and is a strength of an Open Science culture and public multiomic resources such as GeneLab. The addition of untargeted serum and faecal metabolomics would have further strengthened this research and future studies should aim to quantitatively profile the specific deconjugated, dehydroxylated, oxidated, and epimerised bile acids in the system. Alongside metatranscriptomic analysis of the gut microbiome, this would represent an important next step likely to help clarify the directionality of the host-gut microbiome responses associated to spaceflight pathology. Through metagenomic assessment of the murine gut microbiome, significant spaceflight-associated changes in bacteria linked to bile and fatty acid metabolism were identified. These changes in relative abundance were largely consistent in two groups of mice after spaceflight when compared to different on-Earth control groups at different timepoints as well as when using distinct metagenomic methodologies. The microbiome changes coincided with substantial changes to gene expression at the host-gut microbiome interface which are critical to barrier function, microbe interactions and bile acid transport in the intestine. These interactions suggest disruption of the signals, metabolites, and immune factors exchanged across the gut-liver axis which are likely to drive glucose and lipid dysregulation. Collectively, these multiomic findings suggest host-gut microbiome interactions during spaceflight are likely to underly widespread changes to host physiology which could pose a risk to health. Female 32 weeks-old C57BL/6NTac mice (Taconic Biosciences sources) from four treatment groups of the Rodent Research 6 mission were compared: flight live animal return (FLT_LAR), ground control for live animal return (GC_LAR), flight ISS (FLT_ISS) and ground control for ISS (GC_ISS) (Fig.1). FLT_ISS and FLT_LAR mice comprised 40 mice that were launched on SpaceX-13 and transferred to the rodent research habitat on the ISS whereas their matched ground controls, GC_ISS and GC_LAR, were 40 mice kept in identical rodent habitats at Kennedy Space Centre. Not all mice were available to NASA GeneLab for DNA and RNA extractions (replicate numbers provided below). Diet (LabDiet Rodent 5001) and deionized autoclaved water were providedad libitum, and a 12:12 h dark/light cycle maintained. After 29 days of flight onboard the ISS, FLT_LAR mice were returned to earth as part of the Live Animal Return (13/1/18) and sacrificed alongside GC_LAR using common processing at ages of 41 weeks old (16/1/18). FLT_ISS mice were sacrificed after 53–56 days of flight onboard the ISS at the same time as GC_ISS mice at the Kennedy Space Centre at 44 weeks old using a common timeline and methodology. During this period in the Destiny module (US laboratory) on the ISS, the mice were exposed to an average daily 165.8 µGy d−1Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR) dose and 117.3 µGy d−1South Atlantic Anomaly (energetic protons) dose (data provided by Ames Life Sciences Data Archive - ALSDA). This is in line with standard range of exposure on the ISS148, and represents around a 100% increase to common exposure on earth. The temperature, relative humidity and elevated carbon dioxide levels on the ISS were mimicked in the ground control rodent habitats at the Kennedy Space over the 56 days of spaceflight, so were not significantly different (t-test,p> 0.05) between flight and ground controls, and averaged 22.75 (±0.35) °C, 41.49 (±2.28) % and 3219 (±340) CO2ppm, respectively. Faecal samples from 32 RR6 mice were available for DNA extraction:n= 9 mice from FLT_LAR,n= 7 mice from GC_LAR,n= 7 mice from FLT_ISS andn= 9 mice from GC_ISS. DNA was extracted using the Maxwell RSC Purefood GMO and Authentication Kit (Promega, Madison, WI) (OSD-249). Half of a frozen faecal pellet was placed into a tube with 940 uL CTAB solution and homogenised using tissue homogenising bead mix (Navy RINO Lysis, Next Advance) on Bullet Blender Gold 24 (Next Advance) for 4 min at 4 °C. Homogenates were centrifuged for 3 min at 10 °C and 21,000 g to deflate foam. The supernatant from each sample was then used to isolate and purify DNA following the manufacturer’s protocol. DNA was eluted in 105 µL RNAse free H2O and was further cleaned using OneStep PCR Inhibitor Removal Kit (Zymo Research). Concentrations for all DNA samples were measured using Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) with a Qubit DNA HS kit. DNA quality and size were assessed using an Agilent 4200 TapeStation with a gDNA ScreenTape Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). All DNA sequence data is available in the NASA GeneLab recordOSD-249. DNA library preparation was performed by the Genome Research Core (GRC) at the University of Illinois at Chicago. 10 ng of genomic DNA was used as input to a two-stage PCR amplification protocol149,150. In the first stage, primers 515 F/806 R (Earth Microbiome Project, V4 targeting) containing Fluidigm ‘Common Sequence’ linkers (CS1 and CS2) were used to amplify gDNA. In the second stage, Fluidigm AccessArray barcoded primers were used to amplify PCR products from the first stage and incorporate Illumina sequencing adaptors and a sample barcode. Sequencing was performed on an Illumina MiniSeq mid-output flow cell, employing paired-end 2 × 153 base reads. Whole metagenome sequence libraries were prepared using an Illumina Nextera DNA Flex Library Prep kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Input DNA was ~100 ng per reaction, and five cycles of PCR were performed. Index adaptors used were IDT for Illumina, 96-well Nextera Flex Dual Index Adapters, set A. Library fragment sizes (~550 bp) were assessed using an Agilent 4200 TapeStation with D1000 DNA ScreenTapes (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Pooled library concentration was measured with a KAPA Library quantification kit (Roche, Wilmington, MA). Library quality control was performed on an Illumina iSeq100 sequencer (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Whole metagenome shotgun sequencing was performed on an Illumina NovaSeq6000 instrument with a 500-cycle SP flow cell. Library preparation and sequencing were performed by the GeneLab Sample Processing Lab (NASA Ames Research Center). Colon samples from 36 RR6 mice were available for RNA extraction:n= 10 mice from FLT_LAR,n= 8 mice from GC_LAR,n= 9 mice from FLT_ISS andn= 9 mice from GC_ISS. Liver samples from 39 mice were available for RNA extraction:n= 10 mice from FLT_LAR,n= 9 mice from GC_LAR,n= 10 mice from FLT_ISS andn= 10 mice from GC_ISS. RNA was extracted from mouse tissue samples using an AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Homogenisation buffer for RNA purification was made by adding 1:100 beta-mercaptoethanol to Buffer RLT (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and kept on ice until use. Approximately 30 mg of frozen colon (OSD-247) or liver (OSD-245) tissue was isolated using a scalpel, weighed and immediately placed in 600 uL of the Buffer RLT solution. Homogenisation was performed using tissue homogenising bead mix (Zirconium Oxide 2.0 mm Beads, Next Advance) on Bullet Blender Gold 24 (Next Advance) for 5 min at 4 °C. Homogenates were centrifuged for 3 min at RT and 14,000 g to remove cell debris. The supernatant from each sample was then used to isolate and purify RNA following the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA was eluted in 50 µL RNAse free H2O. Concentrations for all RNA samples were measured using a Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). RNA quality was assessed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with an RNA 6000 Nano Kit or RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In Mixes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA Cat 4456739, v92) at 1:100 dilution of either Mix 1 or Mix 2 were added on the day of library prep at the concentrations suggested by the manufacturer’s protocol. Ribosomal RNA depletion was performed using an Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Gold kit. Input RNA amounts were ~500 ng; RNA RIN values were > 4. Index adaptors were 1.5 µM (IDT, 384-well xGen Dual Index UMI Adapters). 15 cycles of PCR were performed. Library fragment sizes (~300 bp) were assessed using an Agilent 4200 TapeStation with a D1000 DNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Pooled library concentration was measured by Universal qPCR Master Mix (Kapa Biosystems, Wilmington, MA). Library quality control was performed on an Illumina iSeq100 sequencer (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Whole metagenome sequencing was performed on an Illumina NovaSeq6000 instrument with a 500-cycle SP flow cell. Library preparation and sequencing were performed by the GeneLab Sample Processing Lab (NASA Ames Research Center) and all RNA sequencing data is provided for in the NASA GeneLab recordsOSD-247(colon) orOSD-245(liver). Differential abundance analysis was performed using DESeq2156,157, which performs well with sparse data and uneven library sizes158. Sparsity and count thresholds were applied whereby an ESV count in a single sample was required to be <90% of the count in all samples, and ESV counts were required to be >0 in at least 3 samples from the same group35. A false discovery rate (FDR; Benjamini-Hochberg procedure) <0.1 correction was applied159. Whole metagenome sequencing co-assembly and annotation Quality control used Trim Galore! (v0.6.6)160, a wrapper script to automate quality and adaptor trimming as well as quality control. Trim Galore is based on cutadapt (v2.10)161and fastqc (v0.11.5)162. Trim Galore! PARAMETERS : --trim-n --max_n 0 --paired --retain_unpaired --phred33 --length 75 -q 5 --stringency 1 -e 0.1 -j 1. BBMAP163was used to remove potential contamination from human using the masked version of hg19 human assembly. To remove redundancy in read dataset and reduce the computational load, reads were normalised using ORNA164with the following parameters: -sorting 1 -base 1.7 -kmer 21. MEGAHIT v1.2.9165was used to assemble reads from all samples into one co-assembly usingmeta-largeoption. Kallisto (v0.46.2)166expectation maximisation algorithm was used to complete metagenomics read assignment and infer contig abundance167. Prodigal (v2.6.3)168was used with the optionmetato predict open reading frames (ORFs) and BLAST v2.3.0169was used to annotate contigs sequence. To assign contig taxonomy, a first alignment iteration was run using full contig lengths against the NCBI nr/nt database (January 2022) and Reference Viral Database (RVDB v v25.0). To further resolve nucleotide taxonomic annotation, a second alignment was run against all databases which included selected genomes (additional 1148 sequences) from NCBI refseq informed by first iteration. BLASTn was run using the following parameters:-evalue 1e-50 -word_size 128 -perc_identity 97. Contig alignment scores were compared between the three databases and the best bitscore was selected as the best alignment for a given contig. Descriptive statistics were also provided for contigs with a common species annotation that had an average alignment identity > 97%, total alignment length > 3000 nt and an average query coverage > 20%. To validate ESV sequences using the metagenomics de novo assembly, ESVs were aligned to WMS contigs using BLASTn. To annotate genes, three protein databases (NCBI nr, UniProtKB Swiss-Prot, and TrEMBL; January 2022) were searched using the translated sequences of the predicted proteins. BLASTx was run with the following parameters:-evalue 1e-10 -word_size 6 -threshold 21. Alignment scores were compared between the three databases and the best bitscore was selected as the best alignment for a given orf. GO, pfam, PANTHER, EMBL, InterPro, HAMAP, TIGRFAMs, STRING, HOGENOM, SUPFAM terms were mined from UniProtKB database. Amino acid sequences were used as input in the GhostKOALA webserver170to add functional genes and pathways information. KEGG functional and taxonomic annotation was retrieved using complete and incomplete pathways.Extibacter murisstrain DSM28560 bile acid-inducible operon sequence (baiBCDEFGHI)62, were manually added to default KEGG database. One bai sequence did not have a KEGG term associated to it (baiG MFS transporter; bile acid transporter) and a temporary KEGG term was assigned to it (K9999). Metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) Using metagenome co-assembly from 3.4.2, genome binning was performed using MetaBAT2171. Genome quality estimation of all bins was performed using CheckM (version v1.1.6)172. Taxonomic classification was performed with Bin Annotation Tool (BAT) a pipeline for the taxonomic classification of metagenome assembled genomes173. Murine transcriptome reference mapping Mouse liver and colon RNA-Seq reads were processed and assembled following NASA GeneLab consensus pipeline, as described previously174. Differential abundance/expression analysis Prior to differential abundance analysis, sparsity and count thresholds were applied whereby an ESV/contig/transcript count in a single sample must be <90% of the count across all samples and ESV/contig occurrence must be at least ≥ 3 in samples within the same design factor. Differential abundance (or expression) analysis was performed using DESeq2159based on pre-processed raw abundance of ESVs/contigs/ORFs/transcripts. A false discovery rate (FDR; Benjamini-Hochberg procedure) <0.1 was applied for statistical significance156. Missingness is a known challenge for negative binomial regression models (such as used in DESeq2) when analyzing zero-inflated abundance tables177,178, contigs with an absolute zero across all replicated samples belonging to a same factor were assumed to be structural zeros and flagged as significantly differentially abundant. To address conservativep-value distribution179of RNA-Seq differential expression analysis, local FDR values were computed from DESeq2p-values using fdrtool (v1.2.17)180R library. Functional enrichment analysis Gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of RNASeq data was performed on the Webgestalt182platform using the entire gene list, rank-ordered combining significance and effect size from DESeq2 differential expression analysis, i.e. log2(FC)*-log(pValue)183. Gene symbols were inferred from assembly transcripts using org.Mm.eg.db (v3.16)184R annotation library. This research was generated by the NASA GeneLab Analysis Working Group for Microbes.
