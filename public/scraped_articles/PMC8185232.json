Simplified metabolic pathways linking photosynthesis, carbon fixation and lignin biosynthesis, as well as placement of arogenate dehydratase (ADT) between the chorismate-shikimate, aromatic amino acid, and phenylpropanoid pathways in vascular plant systems. Selected metabolites are illustrated along with enzymes depicted by arrows. Differentially varying lignin levels as above, obtained through systematic manipulation of the 6-memberedArabidopsis ADTgene family (ADT1, At1g11790;ADT2, At3g07630;ADT3, At2g27820;ADT4, At3g44720;ADT5, At5g22630, andADT6, At1g08250), thus offered the opportunity to investigate the holistic nature of such perturbations on overallArabidopsissystems biology. To do this, we carried out multi-omics (i.e., transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) analyses of leaf and stem tissues of single (adt1,adt3,adt4,adt5, andadt6), double, triple and quadruple (adt4/5,adt1/4/5,adt3/4/5, andadt3/4/5/6) KO mutant and WT lines, at 4 weeks of growth/development. In this study, multi-omics “normalization” strategies were employed to enable direct integration and visualization of the disparate “omics” datasets of related transcripts, proteins and metabolites, thereby allowing for greater understanding, confidence and validation of resulting systemic biological perturbations observed. Network analysis (Szklarczyk et al., 2015) was also used to (a) identify enzymes or processes most highly correlated to different lignin levels, and (b) reveal potentially novel enzymes or processes related with lignin level regulation and biosynthesis. This analysis resulted in our provisionally deducing novel transcriptional, post-transcriptional and translational regulatory processes, when carbon flux was reduced in the phenylpropanoid pathway and which profoundly affected lignin deposition. Many proteins identified in our network analysis have not been reported as potentially linked to lignin biosynthesis regulation. For example, several ribosome subunits with high correlations to lignin level profiles were identified, suggesting the possible presence of a “ribocode.” These proteins, as well as other ribosome-interacting mRNA processing proteins detected in our network analysis, indicate that vascular plant lignin levels are not only controlled at the point of transcription but work together with modulating factors at a post-transcriptional and translational level as described below. For metabolomics analyses, OptimaTMgrade water, acetonitrile and formic acid were purchased from Fisher Scientific (Hampton, NH, United States). Authentic standards used for secondary metabolite metabolomics are described inHöhner et al. (2018). For proteomics and RNA-Seq sample preparation, nanopure water was used and all chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, United States) and were of analytical grade unless otherwise noted. ArabidopsisT-DNA Knock Out (KO) Insertion Arabidopsis thalianaWT (Columbia) T-DNA insertion lines were obtained from the Salk Institute Genomic Analysis Laboratory (SIGnAL)1. IndividualADTKO mutant lines were created in homozygous form, with individual lines crossed to ultimately provide double, triple, and quadruple homozygousADTKO mutants (Corea et al., 2012c). Plant Growth and Harvesting Conditions A. thalianaWT (Columbia) and KO mutant lines were grown in Institute of Biological Chemistry (Washington State University) greenhouses with a 16/8 h light/dark cycle at 27–28°C/24–26°C, respectively. Nitrogen-based fertilizer (200 ppm) was added five times a week. Plants were harvested at 4 weeks after planting with rosette leaf and stem tissues individually collected and immediately flash-frozen in liquid N2. Each sample was stored at −80°C until further analysis. Primary Metabolite Derivatization Nine individual plants of each line were frozen in liquid N2and freeze-dried. Dry plant tissues were ground into fine powders using a tissue-lyzer II (Qiagen, Germany) for 30 s at a frequency of 30 Hz at −80°C. Powdered freeze-driedArabidopsisleaves or stems (20 mg) were individually suspended in 500 μL of methanol:2-iso-propanol:water (5:2:2, v/v/v). After adding13C labeled ribitol standard (1.5 μg), each material was extracted by vortexing for 10 min, followed by sonication for 5 min. Extracts were individually centrifuged for 10 min at 15,000 ×g, with supernatants transferred to a new vial and subsequently dried under vacuum. Dry residues were individually re-suspended in water:acetonitrile (500 μL, 1:1 v/v), and re-extracted by sequential vortexing and sonication, followed by centrifugation at 15,000 ×gfor 5 min with supernatants then removed and dried under vacuum. Dry residues were individually suspended inO-methoxylamine hydrochloride (40 mg mL–1in pyridine, 5 μL, Sigma) and incubated for 90 min at 30°C at 1,000 rpm (Eppendorf Thermomixer). Subsequently, samples were individually derivatized with MSTFA (45 μL) with 1% TMCS (Thermo-Pierce) for 30 min at 37°C and 1,000 rpm (Eppendorf Thermomixer). Primary Metabolite Analysis Using Gas Chromatography Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry Analyses were performed using a Pegasus 4D time-of-flight mass spectrometer (LECO) equipped with a Gerstel MPS2 autosampler and an Agilent 7890A oven. Derivatization products were separated on a (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d. ×0.25 μm) Rxi®-5Sil column (Restek) with an IntegraGuard®pre-column using ultrapure He at a constant flow of 1 mL min–1as carrier gas. The linear thermal gradient started with 1 min at 50°C, followed by a ramp to 330°C at 20°C min–1. Final temperature was held for 5 min prior to returning to initial conditions and mass spectra were collected at 17 spectra s–1. The injection port was held at 250°C, and an aliquot of the sample (1 μL) was injected. Peak annotation employed the Fiehn primary metabolite library (Kind et al., 2009), where an identity score cutoff of 600 was used. Peak alignment and mass spectra comparisons were carried out using the Statistical Compare feature of the ChromaTOF®software (LECO). Surrogate standard13C ribitol and original tissue weight were used for normalization. Secondary Metabolomic Analysis Using Liquid Chromatography Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry Metabolites were extracted from freeze-dried material from each individual plant tissue (10 mg) as described (Lu et al., 2017) in 200 μL of methanol:water (70:30, v/v) containing naringenin (Aldrich) as an internal standard. Samples were vortexed, sonicated for 10 min and finally centrifuged at 14,000 ×gat 4°C for 15 min. Supernatants were individually stored at −80°C until analysis. RNA Extraction and Illumina HiSeq Analysis For each sample, liquid nitrogen frozen tissue sample (100 mg) was ground using a mortar and pestle cooled in presence of liquid nitrogen. A SpectrumTMPlant Total RNA kit (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States) was employed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Quality control was performed on a Thermo Scientific NanoDrop with all 260/280 nm and 260/230 nm readings above 1.8. Illumina TruSeq RNA libraries were constructed per the manufacturer’s protocol, with quality evaluated using the Agilent Bioanalyzer. Samples were sequenced on a HiSeq 2000 instrument (Illumina, San Diego, CA, United States). Six lanes were multiplexed with five samples per lane in the single ended, 50 bp configuration. A mean of 41 M reads passing quality filters was obtained for each sample (min. 31 M, max. 50 M). Cluster generation used the cBot SR Cluster Gen Kit (V3) and the flow cell used was SR FC Information (V3). Protein Extraction and Digestion Ice cold 0.1 M ammonium acetate in methanol (10 mL) and β-mercaptoethanol (250 μL) were added to each pulverized powder sample (ground in liquid nitrogen in a mortar and pestle) followed by vigorous shaking for 15 s. For stem tissues, a Polytron homogenizer was used for about 30 s at a speed of 30 to further homogenize them. Samples were individually placed in a −20°C freezer for 2 h, and subsequently centrifuged for 10 min at 5000 ×gat 4°C. Each supernatant was next removed and discarded. The above addition of ammonium acetate/methanol solution and centrifugation steps were repeated four more times to remove metabolites and lipids from each sample. Excess methanol was removed by drying the pellets gently under a flow of nitrogen for ∼2 min. A protein solubilization solution containing 7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 4% CHAPS and 5 mM of neutralized tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) (Bond-Breaker, Thermo Fisher, San Jose, CA, United States) was added to each sample to completely cover each pellet, plus 500 μL more. Samples were then individually incubated at 4°C overnight. Debris from each was physically mixed into solution with a pipette tip and the slurry sonicated in a Hielscher UTR200 ultrasonic processor for 10–20 s at 100% amplitude. Protein slurries were next individually incubated at 60°C for 30 min, with samples vortexed and sonicated in the sonoreactor again for about 30 s. Each sample was then centrifuged for 10 min at 5000 ×gat 4°C. A Coomassie Plus protein assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL, United States), using a bovine serum albumin (BSA) standard, was next conducted on individual supernatants to estimate protein contents. Afterward, denatured samples were diluted tenfold with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.0). CaCl2was added to a concentration of 2 mM and trypsin (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, United States) was added at a trypsin:sample ratio of 1:50 (w/w). Samples were individually digested overnight at 37°C and then alkylated with chloroacetamide at a concentration of 5 mM in the dark at 37°C for 30 min. Peptides from each treatment were desalted with an SCX SPE (SUPELCO Supelclean) using 10 mM ammonium formate (pH 3.0), 25% acetonitrile (v/v) in water, to remove CHAPS, and then a 80:15:5 (v/v/v) methanol:water:ammonium hydroxide (14.8 M) was used to elute peptides. C-18 SPE columns (SUPELCO Discovery) were employed to remove ammonium salts, using a 0.1% TFA (v/v) in nanopure water to wash the peptides and a 80:20 (v/v) acetonitrile:water with 0.1% (v/v) TFA solvent to elute peptides. Peptides were quantified using a BCA assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL, United States) with a BSA standard. Peptides were labeled with 8-plex iTRAQ (AB Sciex, Redwood City, CA, United States) reagents: Each peptide sample (30 μg) was placed in a new tube and dried down. Dissolution buffer (iTRAQ buffer kit, 13 μL) was added to each sample, these being vortexed into solution and centrifuged briefly to draw sample to the bottom of each tube. iTRAQ reagent (10 μL) was diluted further with isopropanol (35 μL), and this was added to each sample. Each reaction was carried out at room temperature for 2 h, with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (200 μL) added to quench each reaction. After 1 h, contents from all iTRAQ channel reactions were added to one tube and then the sample was vortexed and dried down in a centrifugal vacuum concentrator. Offline Fractionation of Peptides and Preparation of Proteome Samples Labeled peptides were separated using an off-line high pH (pH 10) reversed-phase (RP) separation with a Waters XBridge C18 column (250 mm × 4.6 mm i.d., 5 μm particle size) and a guard column (4.6 mm × 20 mm) using an Agilent 1200 HPLC System. Each sample loaded onto the C18 column was washed for 15 min with Solvent A [10 mM ammonium formate, adjusted to pH 10 with ammonium hydroxide (14.8 M)]. The gradient started with a linear increase of 0% Solvent B [10 mM ammonium formate, pH 10, acetonitrile:water (90:10 v/v)] to: 5% Solvent B over 10 min, 45% Solvent B over 65 min, and then to 100% Solvent B over 15 min. Solvent B was held at 100% for 10 min, and then this was changed to 100% Solvent A, this being held for 20 min to recondition the column. The flow rate was 0.5 mL min–1. A total of 48 fractions were collected for each sample into a 96 well plate throughout the above LC gradient. The high pH RP fractions were then combined into 12 fractions using the concatenation strategy previously reported (Wang et al., 2011). Peptide fractions were dried down and re-suspended in nanopure water at a concentration of 75 ng μL–1for mass spectrometry analysis using an LTQ-Orbitrap Velos MS (Thermo Scientific) system as described below. Mass-Spectrometry Based Analysis of Peptide Samples The LC system was custom built using two Agilent 1200 nanoflow pumps and one Agilent 1200 cap pump (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, United States), various Valco valves (Valco Instruments Co., Houston, TX, United States), and a PAL autosampler (Leap Technologies, Carrboro, NC, United States). Full automation was made possible by custom software that allows for parallel event coordination and therefore near 100% MS duty cycle through use of two trapping and analytical columns. Reversed-phase columns were prepared in-house by slurry packing 3 μm Jupiter C18(Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, United States) into 40 cm × 360 μm o.d. ×75 μm i.d. fused silica (Polymicro Technologies Inc., Phoenix, AZ, United States) using a 1-cm sol-gel frit for media retention (Maiolica et al., 2005). Trapping columns were prepared similarly by slurry packing 5-μm Jupiter C18into a 4-cm length of 150 μm i.d. fused silica and fritted on both ends. Mobile phases consisted of 0.1% formic acid in water (A) and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (B) operated at 300 nL–1min with a linear gradient profile as follows (min:%B): 0:5, 2:8, 20:12, 75:35, 97:60, 100: 85. Sample injections (5 μL) were trapped and washed on the trapping columns at 3 μL min–1for 20 min prior to alignment with analytical columns. Data acquisition lagged the gradient start and end times by 15 min to account for column dead volume that allowed for the tightest overlap possible in a two-column operation. The two-column operation also allowed for columns to be “washed” (shortened gradients) and re-generated off-line without any cost to duty cycle. The LTQ Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer was operated in the data-dependent mode acquiring higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) scans (R= 7,500, 5 × 104 target ions) after each full MS scan (R= 30,000, 3 × 106 target ions) for the top ten most abundant ions within the mass range of 300 to 1,800m/z. An isolation window of 2.5 Thomson units (Th) was used to isolate ions prior to HCD. All HCD scans used normalized collision energy of 45 and maximum injection time of 1000 ms. The dynamic exclusion time was set to 60 s and charge state screening was enabled to reject unassigned and singly charged ions. Peptide Identification and Quantification For peptide identification, MS/MS spectra were searched against a decoyA. thalianaprotein TAIR106database using the algorithm SEQUEST (Eng et al., 1994). Search parameters included: no enzyme specificity for proteome data and trypsin enzyme specificity with a maximum of two missed cleaves, ±50 ppm precursor mass tolerance, ±0.05 Da product mass tolerance, and carbamidomethylation of cysteines and iTRAQ labeling of lysines and peptide N-termini as fixed modifications. Allowed variable modifications were oxidation of methionine and proline. MS-GF (Kim et al., 2008) spectra probability values were also calculated for peptides identified from SEQUEST searches. Measured mass accuracy and MS-GF spectra probability were used to filter identified peptides to <0.4% false discovery rate (FDR) at spectrum level and <1% FDR at the peptide level using the decoy approach. iTRAQ reporter ions were extracted using the MASIC software (Monroe et al., 2008) with a 10 ppm mass tolerance for each expected iTRAQ reporter ion as determined from each MS/MS spectrum. Protein and Transcript Relative Fold-change,Z-score andP-value Determinations All proteins with a high Spearman rank correlation (rho > 0.85) to the monomeric guaiacyl (G) and syringyl (S) lignin-derived moieties, and which had az-score ratio value no more than ±0.5 in theadt1 versusWT analysis, were identified in WT andadt1,adt3,adt4,adt5,adt4/5,adt1/4/5,adt3/4/5, andadt3/4/5/6mutants, and were entered into the STRING network analysis algorithm7(Szklarczyk et al., 2017) searching against theA. thalianadatabase. STRING returned protein-protein associations, type of association, and strength of association. Known interactions from either curated databases or which were experimentally determined were considered, along with predicted interactions from gene fusion, gene co-occurrence, gene neighborhood experiments, as well as from text mining, co-expression datasets and protein homology datasets. Node interactions were selected only if STRING returned a minimum interaction score of 0.4 or higher and for nodes with at least one interaction. These data were then exported into an interaction table, this then being made into a SIF document and uploaded into Cytoscape 3.4.0 (Smoot et al., 2011). In Cytoscape, the layout attribute Organic was selected under yFiles Layout. Nodes in close proximity were further clustered together manually based on either like KEGG or a gene ortholog (GO) term functional category if no KEGG category existed. Nodes were represented by rectangles colored by a red-blue color scheme to representz-scores of log2ratios (ADTKO mutant/WT), where red represents proteins higher in abundance inADTKO mutants compared to WT, white symbolizes no change, and blue represents proteins higher in abundance in WT compared toADTKO mutants. The thickness of the edge represents strength of relationship between nodes/proteins, as determined by the final combined score output of STRING. A more focused STRING analysis was carried out just on ribosome, spliceosome and mRNA processing involved proteins to view the putative specific connections. Only associations related to known and predicted interactions were considered. A minimum interaction score of 0.4 or higher was used for nodes with at least one interaction. A multi-omics evaluation ofArabidopsis ADTKO mutant lines (compared to WT plants) was conducted at 4 weeks of growth/development, when the plants had fully developed rosette leaves and had stems about 10–20 cm high (∼1/3 height at maturity). For both tissue types, full RNA-Seq transcriptomics, iTRAQ 8-plex multiplexing proteomics coupled with LC-MS/MS, together with primary (GC-MS) and secondary (LC-MS) metabolomics analyses were performed. Data interrogation resulted in confident detection (1% FDR) of 27,181 transcripts, 8,672 proteins, together with 132 primary and 30 secondary metabolites. Normalization of Expression Data for Multi-Omics Integration Each biomolecular class (i.e., transcripts, proteins, and metabolites) was measured using disparate workflows. Since only a few replicate analyses were feasible, as is typical for RNA-Seq and proteome analysis, variance estimations were offset by “borrowing” information from genes or proteins across the entire analysis (Subramaniam and Hsiao, 2012). The general rationale for this approach relied on the assumption that variance is similar for biomolecules of similar abundances. Transcript or peptide measurements with similar abundances can therefore act as pseudo-replicates producing similar distribution parameters. This strategy is commonly utilized for expression data and with various bioinformatics tools [e.g., SAM (Tusher et al., 2001), limma (Ritchie et al., 2015), and VAMPIRE (Hsiao et al., 2005)]. In stem tissue, other carbohydrates such as D-glyceric acid (2.8 fold), 6-deoxy-D-glucose (10.1 fold), and fructose-6-phosphate (4.1 fold) also had higher levels inADTKO linesversusWT, whereas significantly increased levels of D-glucoheptose (36.1 fold), allose (4.0 fold), gluconic lactone (3.5 fold), sorbose (2.5 fold), threonic acid (7.3 fold), and glucose-1-phosphate (3.9 fold) were observed in leaves. Amino acids with the most increased levels in theADTKO mutantsversusWT stem tissues included allothreonine (4.2 fold), alanine (2.3 fold), and glutamate (2.2 fold). By contrast, decreases in theADTKO lines were found for oxoproline (2.4 fold) in the stems. Interestingly, shikimate which is a key metabolite located in the aromatic amino acid/shikimate chorismate pathways upstream of ADT, was, on average, increased (2.6 fold) inADTKO mutant leaves, but decreased (8.3 fold) in abundance in stem tissues. Transcriptomics and Proteomics Analysis Various metabolites can often be synthesized or metabolized by one or more isoenzymes contained in distinct plant compartments and/or expressed at different times within a plant’s lifespan. This makes metabolite identification and quantification alone not entirely sufficient to convey key information on specific gene/enzyme targets necessary for full understanding of a system or for bioengineering purposes. For this reason, transcriptomics and proteomics prove to be invaluable for identifying significantly affected pathways, specific gene/enzyme targets, gene regulation events, and tissue specific and/or subcellular compartment-specific target enzyme information. RNA-Seq data also indicated an increase inADTexpression betweenADT3,ADT4, andADT5, when one of theADTs in that subgroup was knocked-out. Large increases ofADT5were observed in the stems whenADT3andADT4were knocked out, showing ∼2 fold and ∼4 fold increases in theadt3andadt4knockout lines, respectively. WhenADT5was knocked out,ADT4was expressed in greater amounts (∼2 fold increase). Overall, these data showed that, especially in stem tissue,ADTmRNA expression betweenADT3,ADT4, andADT5seemed to be coordinated, as remainingADTsin theADT3/ADT4/ADT5subgroup increased when other subgroup members were knocked out. In leaf tissue, only modest effects were observed within this subgroup. To view coverage and relative amounts (i.e., counts) of mRNA fragments identified in each RNA-Seq analysis (in reference to eachADTin leaves or stems), location of the various T-DNA insertions used to produce the KOs and peptides identified from the proteomics analysis, gene product data for each gene were illustrated side by side. The IGV Browser (Robinson et al., 2011;Thorvaldsdóttir et al., 2013) was used to map out reads to the gene, and using a PNNL developed script9, the peptide data were converted into BED files which could then be used by any genome viewer software. This allowed visualization of proteomics data in relation to the gene alongside the RNA-Seq data. While increases in the proportion of significantly changed proteins were observed in photosynthesis and carbon fixation pathways, especially in stems, such large changes were not seen at the corresponding transcript level. The fact that mRNA pools related to photosynthesis and carbon fixation were not changed much, whereas translation copy numbers were largely increased, raises the possibility of a post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism. Other categories which were markedly different between protein and transcript data included those involved in Phe metabolism, and glycolate/decarboxylate metabolism. These were found to be highly changed in the protein data, especially in stem tissues, but less so at the transcript level. Categories that showed relatively high changes at the transcript level, but did not seem to translate to higher changes at the protein level, included those pathways involved in alanine/aspartate/glutamate, propanoate, and galactose metabolism, respectively. This was not surprising given that ADTs biosynthesize Phe. We also observed that shikimate-chorismate derived metabolism pathways (i.e., to Phe, Tyr, and tryptophan) were highly changed at both transcript and protein levels. It is known that Phe, Tyr, and Trp produced via the shikimate-chorismate pathway contribute to feedback inhibition mechanisms of various shikimate pathway enzymes upstream of ADT (Tzin and Galili, 2010), and thatADTKOs can alter not only Phe levels but also levels of Tyr and Trp (Corea et al., 2012a). We thus hypothesize that inADTKO mutants there likely may be alterations in the levels of other metabolites synthesized from Phe/Tyr/Trp precursors. These could potentially affect metabolites including phytohormones, which could, in turn, produce system-wide effects. For instance, phytohormone indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) is synthesized from Trp, and IAA can affect changes in growth, development and metabolism (Zhao, 2010). Integrated Metabolome, Proteome, and Transcriptome Analysis Proposed correlations of transcript and protein data.(A)Pearson pairwise correlation plots of each log2abundance ratio data between eachADTKO mutant versus WT dataset compared with all others in both the transcript and protein data. The two leftmost plots are from transcript and protein data, and the last two plots represent collapsed transcript and protein KEGG ortholog data (KEGO) for leaf or stem sample sets.(B)Venn diagram transcripts and proteins, and transcripts and protein KEGOs identified in leaf and stem data.(C)Transcript and protein overlap in all protein and transcript data according to KEGG functional category. Transcript-metabolite-protein heatmap displayingz-score comparisons of the log2ratio pairs (ADTKO mutant/wild type, WT) of identified metabolites found to have a corresponding KEGG Ortholog Gene Family (KEGO) member which utilizes that specific metabolite as a substrate, and which were detected in both transcript and proteomics data. Each KEGO is displayed with substrate and product metabolite formed by that KEGO enzyme family. Data is further sorted into clusters that show:(A) Cluster 1–Transcripts, metabolites and proteins which all on average increased or decreased in theADTKO mutants together compared to WT.(B) Cluster 2–Transcripts decreased, while metabolites and proteins in theADTKO lines, on average, increased in abundance.(C) Cluster 3–Transcripts and metabolites on average in theADTKO lines increased, and proteins decreased in abundance compared to WT.(D) Cluster 4–Transcripts and proteins decreased, and metabolites on average increased in theADTKO mutants compared to WT. In each cluster, entries are further grouped by whether or not Metabolite 1 is a substrate or product in a unidirectional reaction or if it can be utilized in a reversible reaction. Reactions are then ordered from highest average metabolitez-score to lowest metabolitez-score. Red represents metabolites higher in abundance in theADTKO mutant compared to WT, blue represents metabolites higher in abundance in WT compared to theADTKO mutant, white represents metabolites unchanged in abundance between WT and theADTKO mutant, and grey represents constituents not detected. Green squares indicate the highest average KEGO value associated with each detected metabolite. Grey circles represent KEGO reactions where there was only a single known reaction for that given substrate-product reaction. Blue circles represent log2transcript data that is most highly correlated to log2metabolite data acrossADTKO mutants, i.e. if ratio abundances between transcripts and metabolites both showed profile increases across single, double, triple and quadrupleADTKO mutants, those would have a positive correlation regardless if thez-score values themselves were negative or positive. Orange circles represent log2protein data that are most highly correlated to log2metabolite data acrossADTKO mutants, i.e. if ratio abundances between proteins and metabolites both showed profile increases across single, double, triple and quadrupleADTKO mutants, those would have a positive correlation regardless if thez-score values themselves were negative or positive.

Alongsidez-score values for each KEGO and metabolite, indicators were added to show the reaction that represented the most abundant KEGO for multiple KEGO reactions for a given metabolite. Indicators were also added for which KEGO abundances were most highly correlated to metabolite abundances. Additionally, KEGO reactions were further grouped into categories of whether or not the detected metabolite was either substrate or product in each reaction, or if it could be involved in a reversible reaction (i.e., a metabolite that can serve as both substrate and product). Lignin levels were measured previously in theADTKO mutant and WT lines byCorea et al. (2012c)A Spearman’s rank correlation between theADTKO mutant and WT log2ratios to these lignin levels in 4 week old stems was thus calculated here, with proteins identified with a non-parametric measure of rank correlation (rho) of at least ±0.85. Proteins identified as having a high positive or negative correlation to varying lignin levels acrossADTKO mutants were entered into the on-line network analysis tool STRING (see text footnote 7) (Szklarczyk et al., 2017). Protein-protein interactions and associations identified from STRING were then used as input data into the network software Cytoscape (Smoot et al., 2011). Network analysis and related correlations.(A)Network analysis of relative protein abundances determined to be highly correlated in a Spearman rank correlation analysis (rho > 0.85) to lignin cleaved guaiacyl (G) + syringyl (S) monomer levels in 4 week old stem tissues ofadt3/4/5. Nodes are represented by rectangles colored by thez-score of the log2ratios (ADTKO mutant/WT), where red represents proteins higher in abundance in the mutant compared to WT, blue represents proteins higher in abundance in WT compared to theADTKO mutant, and white represents proteins unchanged in abundance between WT and theADTKO mutant.(B)STRING analysis with solely highly correlated proteins identified in KEGG functional categories associated with ribosomes, spliceosome, and RNA transport showing the direct known and predicted interactions.(C)Heatmap showing log2ratio distribution (ADTKO mutant/WT) for proteins associated with the ribosome, spliceosome and RNA transport for each plant line for transcript and protein data. To begin to put the analyses and discussion below in needed context, it is well known that transcripts and proteins are linked biologically by the central dogma which purports unidirectional flow of genetic information from DNA to RNA to proteins (Crick, 1958). Indeed, comparisons between proteomic and transcriptomic data can highlight which proteins and transcripts have a co-regulatory response (i.e., a high transcript level with a high protein level). The central dogma though is extended in this study to include metabolomics, as many metabolites represent the final product(s) biosynthesized by specific cells/tissues under various environmental conditions or through stresses at specific times during the lifespan of an organism. Protein and Transcript Comparisons Furthermore, metabolite levels did not show a dominant correlation with either transcripts or proteins. These data illustrate the limitations in using only a single omics evaluation to make systems level biological assessments. Comparisons between these omics datasets may thus reveal (a) what transcripts are actually translated and in what copy number, and (b) what metabolomics data help reveal which proteins or protein families are more or less active in producing the observed metabolites. The integrated “omics” analysis, as presented here, provides over-arching and molecule specific information, which is useful for understanding general molecular pathway trends, and for identifying targets of interest for bioengineering purposes or for follow-on analyses. Network Analysis Reveals Lignin/Phenylpropanoid Biosynthesis Associated Proteins Network analysis is a powerful tool for understanding systems biology effects, drawing from known and predicted direct (physical) and indirect (functional) interactions from multiple data and literature sources. Such analyses can utilize enzyme relationships derived from hundreds of sources (e.g., yeast two hybrid, co-localization, co-expression, literature text mining, etc.). In turn, this can help provide new insights into interconnections and significant relationships of proteins with known and as-of-yet unknown function. Since our main focus was on proteins potentially related to altered lignin levels (as determined by thioacidolysis analysis), we selected those with greatest positive and negative correlative trends to lignin amounts present inArabidopsisstems of each line. Centrally located in the lignin correlated protein network data created (Figures 5A,B) were eleven ribosomal subunits that correlated with reduced lignin levels. This raised the possibility that lignin levels may be in part regulated by a ribosome filter or “ribocode” (Mauro and Edelman, 2002;Xue and Barna, 2012). That is, lignin biosynthesis regulation may be associated with presence of specific ribosomal subunits involved in translation of lignin-biosynthesis-associated mRNA. Recent studies have documented evidence for ribocodes, the concept of which suggests differential, temporal and spatial presence of specific ribosomal subunits which preferentially translate specific mRNAs, thus representing regulation at translation. Other observations of possible plant ribocodes include phosphate and Fe-deficiency studies byRodríguez-Celma et al. (2013)andWang et al. (2013), who both showed evidence for remodeled translational machinery in response to environmental signals inArabidopsis.Liu et al. (2012)also reported that translational control was mRNA abundance independent, concluding that mRNA levels had less effect on gene activity than translational control mechanisms inArabidopsis. Other potential targets of lignin biosynthesis regulation identified included those associated with purine metabolism, the spliceosome, RNA degradation, mRNA surveillance and general mRNA processing proteins. Post-translational modifications, protein transport, and targeting mechanisms also appeared correlated with varying lignin levels. Additionally, post-translational related protein processing involving the endoplasmic reticulum was identified, as well as ubiquitin proteolysis, phosphorylation, autophosphorylation, and phosphatase proteins which may be connected to important processes related to lignin biosynthesis. Connected to the identified spliceosome proteins was SAP18 (Song and Galbraith, 2006). In plants, this functions as a transcriptional repressor and associates with ethylene-responsive element binding factors to create a hormone-sensitive multimeric repressor complex under conditions of stress. A SAP18 loss of function mutant produces a plant both more susceptible to salt and impaired in chlorophyll synthesis. These data indicate what we generally observed with our multi-omics data, namely that: (a) despite any significant presence of mRNA, there are additional factors which may prevent proper processing of mRNA into mature translatable form; (b) there are also other factors which may prevent any mRNA present from ever leaving the nucleus to be translated. Together, these data also highlight the importance of proteomics to illuminate what protein products are actually present and which are potentially functional. Since this study was focused on correlations specific to lignin deposition, most attention was paid to correlative levels found in stems, although other phenylpropanoid-derived biomolecules and other pathways were also affected byADTcomposition changes in leaves. It may be an interesting and informative exercise to further explore correlative enzyme abundances to other phenylpropanoids that may play a more central role in leaf tissue function. For example, those associated with UV protection (e.g., flavonoids and sinapate esters) (Stapleton and Walbot, 1994;Landry et al., 1995;Mazza et al., 2000;Clé et al., 2008;Sullivan et al., 2014), in order to tease out specific post-transcriptional biosynthesis regulation of formation of these other phenylpropanoids. Ultimately, the multi-omics investigation and network analysis presented here proved invaluable for understanding systems level changes that modulated ADTs evoke in a model vascular plant. Importantly, it highlighted potentially new levels of post-transcriptional regulation of lignin/phenylpropanoids that can provisionally serve as biomolecular targets for follow-on analyses and/or for bioengineering purposes, i.e., aimed at modulating or modeling lignin/phenylpropanoids in vascular plants. These proteins can thus be used in follow-on lignin-associated enzyme validation studies and/or can potentially serve as truly novel bioengineering targets for manipulation of lignin/phenylpropanoid levels in vascular plants. Potential of a Lignin Regulating “Ribocode” Ribosomes are the effectors in the final steps of gene expression, and it has emerged recently that ribosomes themselves could contribute to regulation via differential ribosomal subunit abundance. Evidence recently has also shown that according to developmental, environmental and pathological conditions, cells can produce different populations of ribosomes which differ in their ribosomal protein and RNA composition. These “specialized ribosomes” suggest that the unique ribosomal composition determines the translational activity of the ribosome and thus controls the biosynthesis of specific proteins and enzymes. For many years, ribosomes were thought to consist of a set number of ribosomal proteins (RPs) and rRNAs, with each RP present as a single copy with resulting conserved stoichiometry and homogeneity. One of the first indications that different types of ribosomes existed was from the study of RP paralogs in plants. In work done byWilliams and Sussex (1995), it was found that RPL16 paralog gene expression patterns inArabidopsiswere mutually exclusively expressed in different organs of the plant. In yeast studies, deletion of specific RP paralogs also gave rise to unique phenotypes (Ni and Snyder, 2001;Enyenihi and Saunders, 2003). In human studies, evidence came from patients displaying genetic diseases (i.e., ribosomopathies) caused by haploinsufficiency of genes encoding key factors in ribosome biogenesis or RPs (Draptchinskaia et al., 1999). Proteomic-driven analyses exploring composition of purified ribosomes under various conditions identified all RPs differentially expressed between conditions in murine embryonic stem cells, suggesting that different translational statuses were associated with differential stoichiometry among RPs (Slavov et al., 2015). These studies indicating the influence of differential ribosomal subunit stoichiometry on differential phenotypes and/or translational products suggest that the ribosome has the ability to function in a regulatory fashion in translation. These supporting data, along with observations of correlative associations between specific ribosomes and lignin production in this study here, support the hypothesis that lignin levels in vascular plants may be partially controlled by specialized ribosome compositions or a lignin “ribocode.” The datasets presented in this study can be found in online repositories.
