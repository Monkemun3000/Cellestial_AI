Kamal, Texas A&M University, United States; Ruth Bryan, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, United States *Correspondence: Donatella Tesei,donatella.tesei@boku.ac.at This article was submitted to Systems Biology, a section of the journal Frontiers in Genetics Received 2020 Dec 7; Accepted 2021 Feb 19; Collection date 2021. Black fungi are a group of melanotic microfungi characterized by remarkable polyextremotolerance. Due to a broad ecological plasticity and adaptations at the cellular level, it is predicted that they may survive in a variety of extreme environments, including harsh niches on Earth and Mars, and in outer space. However, the molecular mechanisms aiding survival, especially in space, are yet to be fully elucidated. Based on these premises, the rock-inhabiting black fungusKnufia chersonesos(Wt) and its non-melanized mutant (Mut) were exposed to simulated microgravity—one of the prevalent features characterizing space conditions—by growing the cultures in high-aspect-ratio vessels (HARVs). Qualitative and quantitative proteomic analyses were performed on the mycelia and supernatant of culture medium (secretome) to assess alterations in cell physiology in response to low-shear simulated microgravity (LSSMG) and to ultimately evaluate the role of cell-wall melanization in stress survival. Differential expression was observed for proteins involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolic processes, transport, and ribosome biogenesis and translation via ribosomal translational machinery. However, no evidence of significant activation of stress components or starvation response was detected, except for the scytalone dehydratase, enzyme involved in the synthesis of dihydroxynaphthalene (DNH) melanin, which was found to be upregulated in the secretome of the wild type and downregulated in the mutant. Differences in protein modulation were observed betweenK. chersonesosWt and Mut, with several proteins being downregulated under LSSMG in the Mut when compared to the Wt. Lastly, no major morphological alterations were observed following exposure to LSSMG. Similarly, the strains’ survivability was not negatively affected. This study is the first to characterize the response to simulated microgravity in black fungi, which might have implications on future astrobiological missions. Based on their nature as settlers in extreme environments, microbial extremophiles are of great interest to studies aiming to elucidate stress adaptation and survival mechanisms. Successful examples of extremophiles can be found in the fungal domain, alongside bacteria, and archaea, which for a long time were considered to be the sole colonizers of habitats previously considered uninhabitable. Some of these fungal extremophiles show even higher resistance than that of prokaryotes (Shtarkman et al., 2013;Aguilera and González-Toril, 2019). Black fungi in particular represent a group of highly melanized microfungi, whose ability to survive in a variety of extreme environments has in recent decades attracted increasing attention (Selbmann et al., 2005;Sterflinger, 2006;Gorbushina, 2007;Onofri et al., 2007). Desiccation, low nutrient availability, excessive radiation, extreme temperatures, salinity, and pH are some of the multiple sources of stress characterizing the habitats where these organisms have been shown to thrive (Gunde-Cimerman et al., 2000,2003;Selbmann et al., 2008). The highest diversity of black fungi has especially been observed in rocky environments, ranging from mountain summits to the Atacama Desert and the Antarctic cold regions (Gonçalves et al., 2016;Ametrano et al., 2019). Rock represents a harsh habitat and a quite ancient niche for life, believed to reflect early Earth conditions, and thus considered to be a model for extraterrestrial life (Selbmann et al., 2014). The discovery of melanized fungi in extreme environments has prompted researchers to investigate microbial physiology at the absolute edges of adaptability, aiming at a deeper understanding of the limits for life (Dadachova and Casadevall, 2008;Tesei et al., 2012;Zakharova et al., 2013). Other studies have focused on testing fungal survival in space conditions through simulations in ground-based facilities or in space missions that enabled the assessment of the habitability of extraterrestrial environments and, hence, the possibility of life beyond Earth (Scalzi et al., 2012;Onofri et al., 2019). Space and outer space conditions are by definition hostile, as they include enhanced irradiation, microgravity, and temperature extremes (Rabbow et al., 2012,2017;Senatore et al., 2018). Nevertheless, the isolation of melanized fungi from spacecraft and space stations—e.g., the International Space Station (ISS)—has been reported frequently (Checinska et al., 2015;Checinska-Sielaff et al., 2019). In this respect, a number of studies have examined the molecular adaptations of ISS-isolated strains to space conditions, showing alterations in metabolome and proteome (Knox et al., 2016;Blachowicz et al., 2019b;Romsdahl et al., 2019). Investigations of microbial survival in space are therefore relevant also in the context of space missions, to prevent contaminations and to develop strategies to reduce hazard, especially in the case of opportunistic species (Urbaniak et al., 2019). In black fungi, astrobiological studies have evaluated the potential effects of Mars or ISS conditions on fungal viability and metabolism. One investigation revealed that a rock isolate from Antarctica,Cryomyces minteri, could survive simulated Martian atmosphere and pressure, temperature fluctuations between −20 and 20°C, ultraviolet radiation, and vacuum (Onofri et al., 2008). Comparative 2D-PAGE proteomics was carried out for other rock-inhabiting fungi (RIF) (i.e.,Cryomyces antarcticus,Knufia perforans, andExophiala jeanselmei) exposed to these conditions and showed a decrease in protein complexity, followed by recovery of the metabolic activity after 1 week of exposure (Zakharova et al., 2014). Further, survivability ofC.antarcticusin outer space was shown via colony counts following a 1.5-year-long exposure on board the EXPOSE-E facility of the ISS (Onofri et al., 2012). A more recent experiment ofC.antarcticusexposure on rock analogs under space and simulated Martian conditions revealed only slight ultra-structural and molecular damage and pointed out the high stability of DNA within melanized cells (Pacelli et al., 2016). In other investigations, the resistance to acute ionizing radiations was demonstrated in RIF (Pacelli et al., 2017,2018). Together, these studies have revealed the ability of rock-colonizing black fungi to endure space conditions; however, to date, reports that specifically evaluate the response to microgravity have not been produced. In the present study, the qualitative and quantitative proteomic characterization of a black fungus response to LSSMG was carried out for the first time. The rock-associatedKnufia chersonesos(syn.Knufia petricola) was selected as the model organism due to its reported poikilo-tolerance, e.g., the ability to endure xeric conditions, desiccation, high UV-radiation and temperatures (Sterflinger et al., 2012) and to feed on alternative carbon sources like monoaromatic compounds (Nai et al., 2013) and synthetic polyesters (Tesei et al., 2020).K. chersonesosaptitude to withstand levels of gaseous ozone up to 11 ppm was also shown (Tesei et al., unpublished). Furthermore, being the only black fungus known to have a melanin-deficient spontaneous mutant (Tesei et al., 2017),K. chersonesosallows comparative studies attempting to evaluate the stress-protective role of melanin. Cultures ofK. chersonesoswild type and mutant were grown in HARVs and analyzed for changes at the proteome—whole-cell proteome (mycelia) and secretome (culture supernatant)—and at the morphological level, with an eye toward the impact of cell-wall melanization on the physiological response to the stress. The fungal strains used in this study included the non-pathogenic rock-inhabiting fungusK. chersonesosMA5789 wild type (Wt) and MA5790 mutant (Mut), both obtained from the ACBR fungal culture collection of the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna, Austria. The Wt, characterized by a highly melanized mycelium, was isolated from red sandstone in Ny London, Svalbard, Norway. The pink mutant, whose pigmentation is due to unmasking of carotenoids resulting from the lack of melanin, originated spontaneously under laboratory conditions (Tesei et al., 2017).K. chersonesos(syn.K. petricola) is an emerging model organism for analyses aiming at the elucidation of the rock-lifestyle and RIF physiology (Nai et al., 2013). Along with its ascertained thermo-, pH-, UV- and desiccation tolerance (Gorbushina et al., 2008;Sterflinger et al., 2012), the fungus was recently reported to have an aptitude for using synthetic polymers as an alternative carbon source (Tesei et al., 2020). These features and the ability to endure high levels of gaseous ozone (Tesei et al., unpublished), altogether makeK. chersonesosparticularly suited for astrobiology studies. Further, the availability of a mutant strain allows comparative studies attempting to evaluate the role of melanin in stress protection. Fungal cultures were maintained in flasks containing 50 mL of 2% malt extract broth (MEB, pH 5, 2% malt extract, 2% glucose, 1% peptone) at 21°C with shaking at 63 rpm (Innova, Eppendorf). Cultures at exponential phase were used for inoculation of media for all experiments. Exposure to Low-Shear Simulated Microgravity (LSSMG) Fungal pellets were obtained from 5-day-old cultures by centrifugation, washed in 1X phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and subsequently mildly ribolyzed (3 × 20”, speed 4; MP Biomedicals) to separate cells. As clump-like growth is an inherent characteristic of black fungi, mechanical disruption of cell clusters is a prerequisite for both inoculation of cultures and cell counting (Voigt et al., 2020). Following the cell count (Neubauer), the cell number was adjusted to the initial concentration of 2 × 105ml–1with 10 mL fresh 2% MEB and used as seed culture. High-aspect-ratio vessels (HARVs; Synthecon Inc) were filled with the cell suspensions (10 mL) and rotated at 30 rpm (initial rotation rate) in the vertical axis to provide LSSMG conditions inside a chamber with 60% humidity and 22°C, for 7 days. Control runs were set up by rotating the bioreactors in the horizontal axis to provide normal gravity condition (1G) (Rosenzweig et al., 2010;Kim and Rhee, 2016). During cultivation, the rotation speed was adjusted to 43 rpm in order to keep the cells pellets orbiting within the vessel in continual fall and to prevent their contact with the vessel walls (Figures 1A,B). A total of two biological replicates were maintained throughout the experiments. An additional set of experiments identical to the conditions mentioned above was established for measurement of cell concentration and microscope observations. Cell concentration was assessed via hemocytometer count at different time points until completion of the experiment, using two biological replicates (i.e., biomass from two different vessels) for each experimental condition. Following removal of the vessel from the rotator base, samples of cells were collected under sterile conditions in a laminar flow hood using a luer-lock syringe and the syringe port in the culture vessel. The sampling was carried out one vessel at a time while the remaining vessels were kept rotating on the rotator base. Cell survivability at the end of the LSSMG exposure was assessed by enumeration of colony forming units (CFU) using ImageJ software (Schneider et al., 2012), according toChoudhry (2016). Rotary Cell Culture System (RCCSTM, Synthecon) and High Aspect Ratio Vessels (HARVs) used in the LSSMG experiments.(A)Schematic diagram of mechanical principle of the different RCCSs (design: Emily Klonicki). In normal gravity, the vessels (HARVs) rotate around a plane parallel to the gravity vector. Microgravity is simulated by rotating the samples around a plane perpendicular to the gravity vector.(B)The RCCS used to generate 1G condition (control) on ground (left); the RCCS used to generate LSSMG condition on ground (right);(C)Colony and cultural features ofKnufia chersonesosMA 5789 (wild type, Wt) and MA5790 (mutant, Mut) under LSSMG and 1G on the first and last day of cultivation. The HARVs provide oxygenation via a flat, silicon rubber gas transfer membrane located at the base of the vessel and directly underneath the cultures. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) For SEM studies, samples from the two strains were collected from all the established cultures—LSSMG and normal gravity condition (1G)—at various timepoints, i.e., 1, 3, 5, and 7 days from the beginning of the cultivation. A 1:10 dilution of each sample was prepared using 1X phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and thereafter transferred onto electron microscopy coupons. For each sample, two biological replicates (and two technical replicates each i.e., aliquots of 20 μl) were prepared and let dry at 35°C before examination. A Sirion (FEI, Hillsboro, OR, United States) field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) was used for examination of the fungal cells. No specimen preparation procedures, such as sample coating with a surface-conducting (carbon or metal) layer, were performed as they were not necessary when using the FE-SEM. The samples were analyzed using an acceleration voltage of 10–20 kV, beam current of 40–50 mA and positioning the detector 6–10 mm away from the coupon. Secondary electron images were acquired in the high-vacuum mode. For each sample coupon, a minimum of 10 fields was observed, and images were acquired with various magnification (100×–5,000×). For the cell integrity and viability assay, wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) and propidium iodide (PI) in combination with SYTO 9 were used. The carbohydrate-binding lectin WGA has a known affinity for β-1,4-N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) oligomers present in the fungal polysaccharide chitin. PI, a membrane impermeant dye that is generally excluded from viable cells, was applied together with the nuclear and chromosome counterstain SYTO 9 for a dead/live stain. 200 μl aliquots were collected from all the established cultures after 1, 3, 5, and 7 days from the beginning of the cultivation. Fungal cells were washed twice in 1X PBS and suspended in 500 μl. Following a 1:10 dilution, 100 μl cell suspension was incubated with 50 μl Alexa Fluor 350 conjugate of WGA (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 15 μl of FungaLight containing equal amounts of PI and SYTO 9 solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific), for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. The chosen amounts of the fluorescent probes are justified by the thickening and the increase in melanization of the cell walls, which hindered the staining process. Cell suspensions were mounted over glass slides and analyzed under an Axioplane microscope equipped with an AxioCam camera (Carl Zeiss). For each sample, two technical replicates were prepared for observation. Tandem Mass Tag (TMT)-Based Quantitative Shotgun Proteomics The content of each vessel was spun at 7500 × g (5810, Eppendorf) and at 4°C for 15 min to separate fungal cell pellet (mycelium) from culture supernatant (secretome). Protease inhibitors (10 μl:1 mL v/v, Halt, Thermo Fisher Scientific) were thereafter added—and mixed with 1 mL 1 × PBS in the case of biomass samples—and samples were stored at −80°C prior to protein extraction. Proteins were extracted as previously described byRomsdahl et al. (2018)with some modifications. In brief, 1 mL lysis buffer consisting of 100 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB) with 1:100 Halt Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added to fungal cell pellets (i.e., ∼0.5 g) and culture supernatants (i.e., ∼0.5 mL), the latter previously concentrated in a SpeedVac system. Sample homogenization was achieved using a bead beater (Bertin) at 4°C (3 × 5500 rpm for 1 min., with 15 s. breaks in between) and following centrifugation at 17,000 ×gand 4°C for 15 min, protein concentrations were determined by BCA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The protein extracts were processed for a tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling as previously described (Romsdahl et al., 2018). For each sample, 250 μg proteins were precipitated in 20% TCA at 4°C, reduced by tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP), alkylated with iodoacetamide (IAA), and digested with Trypsin/LysC (Promega, Madison, WI, United States) overnight at 37°C. Peptide quantitation was performed using the Pierce Quantitative Colorimetric Peptide Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The proteomic and secretomic profiling ofK. chersonesosWt and Mut were carried out in two separate TMT LC/MS experiments. A total of 40 μg peptides from each cell pellet sample or 13 μg peptides from each culture supernatant were labeled with the Thermo Scientific TMT10 plex (TMT10) Isobaric Mass Tagging Kit according to the manufacturer protocol. Eight TMT tags were used to label samples from the same experimental set. The TMT10-131 label was used as a reference that contained a pool of 5 μg of peptides from all samples. All nine labeled-peptide samples were combined into a single tube, mixed and fractionated using the Pierce High pH Reversed-Phase Peptide Fractionation Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The fractionated samples were dried using a SpeedVac concentrator and dissolved in 1% formic acid prior to LC-MS/MS analysis. The samples were analyzed on an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer with a Dionex UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano system, a 300 μm × 5 mm PepMap100 C18 precolumn, a 75 μm × 50 cm PepMap RSLC C18 analytical column, and an Easy-Spray ion source (Thermo Scientific). The column temperature was maintained at 45°C, and the peptides were eluted at a flow rate of 300 nL/min over a 110 min gradient, from 3 to 30% solvent B (100 min), 30 to 50% solvent B (5 min), 50 to 90% solvent B (1 min), 90% solvent B (1 min), and 90% to 3% solvent B (3 min). Solvent A was 0.1% formic acid in water and solvent B was 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. The full MS survey scan (400–1,600 m/z) was acquired in the orbitrap at a resolution of 240,000 and with an automatic gain control (AGC) target of 4 × 105. The maximum injection time for MS scans was 50 ms. Monoisotopic precursor ions were selected with charge states 2–7 within a ± 10 ppm mass window using a 60 s dynamic exclusion. The MS2scan (400–1,200 m/z) was performed using the linear ion trap with the CID collision energy set to 35%. The ion trap scan rate was set to “rapid,” with an AGC target of 1 × 104, and a maximum injection time of 30 ms. Ten fragment ions from each MS2experiment were then simultaneously selected for an MS3experiment. The MS3scan (100–500 m/z) was performed to generate the TMT reporter ions in the orbitrap at a resolution of 30,000 and using HCD at a collision energy setting of 65%, an AGC target of 5 × 104, and a maximum injection time of 54 ms. Quantitative Proteomics Analysis Protein Identification and Bioinformatics Analysis To evaluate the presence of LSSMG-dependent alterations of fungal cell morphology in the melanotic (Wt) and non-melanized spontaneous mutant (Mut) strain, we examined cellular differentiation by growing cells at low density. In order to analyze single cellular morphology of the Wt and Mut strain before LSSMG-treatment, exponentially growing fungal cells were spotted on top of aluminum coupons and visualized using FE-SEM. The observation of the control fungal cell morphology in non-coated FE-SEM specimens revealed that the Wt produced biconcave cells, pseudohyphae and hyphae, while the mutant showed smooth spherical cells, pseudohyphae and cell aggregates (Figures 2,3).

In theK. chersonesosmutant, LSSMG triggered the upregulation of just a low number of proteins. The malate dehydrogenase CF317_003266-T1/A0A1C1CNC5_9EURO, 1,3-beta-D-glucan-UDP glucosyltransferase CF317_000614-T1/A0A438MTW5_EXOME and alpha, alpha-trehalase CF317_004588-T1/H6C927_EXODN, involved in the metabolism of starch, sucrose, and sphingolipids, were 2. 4-, 1.9-, and 1.8-fold upregulated, respectively. Conversely, proteins with decreased abundance encompassed, among others, enzymes catalyzing different steps throughout the process of glycolysis/gluconeogenesis (KEGG pathway hsa00010)—such as the putative phosphotransferase CF317_008448/W2RU25_9EURO, the phosphoglycerate kinase CF317_004751/W2RJE3_9EURO and the 2-phosphoglycerate dehydratase CF317_003513/H6BNI5_EXODN—fructose and mannose (hsa00051), pyruvate (hsa00620) and glycerolipid metabolism (hsa00561), and the pentose phosphate pathway (hsa00030) (i.e., phosphotransferase, epimerase domain-containing protein CF317_008979 and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, decarboxylating CF317_005481). Further, the CF317_007096/A0A0U1M0E3_TALIS 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase, acting as an activator of the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway (Raben and Wolfgang, 2019), was the most decreased protein in the GO category of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, with a 3-fold downregulation. Additionally downregulated in response to LSSMG were the uncharacterized HIT domain-containing protein CF317_006677-T1 (over 3-fold regulated) and the putative versicolorin reductase CF317_003229-T1 (over 2-fold regulated), the latter known to mediate aflatoxins biosynthetic processes (Nakamura et al., 2011). Modulation was also observed in proteins involved in transport such as the above-mentioned 1,3-beta-D-glucan-UDP glucosyltransferase CF317_000614-T1 with a role on starch and sucrose metabolism, the endoplasmic reticulum transmembrane protein CF317_004472-T1, and the inorganic phosphate transport protein PHO88 CF317_006347-T1, which all appeared to be upregulated. Conversely, the transmembrane transporter “putative inorganic phosphate transporter C8E4.01c” CF317_002531-T1, the uncharacterized NTF2 domain-containing protein CF317_007808-T1, and the glycolytic enzyme phosphotransferase CF317_008448-T1 were detected as downregulated. Knufia chersonesosWt and Mut Exhibit Opposite Regulation of Several Differentially Expressed Proteins Knufia chersonesosWt and Mut Comparative Analysis Under Normal Gravity (1G) A comparative analysis of wild type and mutant was performed to evaluate different responses at the proteome and secretome level under control condition, i.e., normal gravity. The analysis of the whole-cell proteome yielded a total of 100 proteins with increased and 40 proteins with decreased abundance inK. chersonesosMut, compared with the wild type (fold change of ≥ ± 1.5,p≤ 0.05). To date, investigations into the responses of microorganisms to space and Mars-like conditions have been performed with few black fungi species; some of them involved stress simulation in ground-based facilities (Pacelli et al., 2017), while others carried out the exposure of fungal strains inside or outside the International Space Station (Onofri et al., 2012,2019;Pacelli et al., 2016). With only one exception (Zakharova et al., 2014)—the comparative study of 2D protein patterns under Mars-like conditions—the majority of astrobiological work carried out with black fungi has mainly focused on the analysis of ultrastructural alterations and DNA integrity. Hence, this study represents the first qualitative and quantitative proteomic characterization of a black fungus response to simulated space conditions, i.e., microgravity, which has significance to exobiology and implications to planetary protection policy. In-depth understanding of proteome-related alterations in cell physiology is crucial to gaining new insight into the evolution of extremophiles and the actual limits for life. Further, the comparative analysis of a melanin-deficient mutant and the wild type is important to evaluate the role of melanization in stress survival. GO analysis and pathways prediction further revealed upregulation of proteins involved in the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids (USFA) and in the metabolism of phospho- and glycerophospholipids. This may be explained by modifications in membrane lipid composition aimed at maintaining membranes stability against stress (Xia et al., 2019). More specifically, an LSSMG-dependent increase in membrane fluidity attributable to a higher USFA/SFA ratio was previously demonstrated by studies in plain lipid membranes, various microorganisms e.g.,Escherichia coliand plants upon exposure to microgravity (Sieber et al., 2014;Kim and Rhee, 2016;Kordyum and Chapman, 2017). Potentially, this could affect the function of membrane-integrated proteins, thereby leading to altered transporter activity. Whether the activity of uptake transporters is altered in microgravity conditions is currently unknown (Eyal and Derendorf, 2019). However, similarly to what was observed in other fungi e.g.,C. albicans(Crabbé et al., 2013) and bacteria e.g.,Bacillus subtilis(Morrison et al., 2019) in space,K. chersonesosWt and Mut ion-channels and integral membrane proteins were found to be upregulated. The increased abundance of specific transporters generally maximizes the uptake of nutrients (e.g., phosphate and nitrogen). As such, it possibly represents an adaptive response to temporary starvation caused either by zones of nutrient depletion developing around the colony or by the partial loss of contact of the cells with the culture medium, which may occur under microgravity conditions (Mazars et al., 2014;Senatore et al., 2018). Other types of transporters—i.e., ammonium transporters and permeases for transmembrane amino acid transport—could provide a link between nitrogen assimilation and proteins synthesis (Martzivanou et al., 2006). Indeed, upregulation of proteins involved in amino acid biosynthesis and metabolic processes was recorded under LSSMG conditions, but a higher number of these proteins was found to be decreased, especially in the mutant proteome. In a similar fashion, proteins taking part in functional organization of cell organelles and cytoskeleton—for which a wide spectrum of microgravity-dependent changes has been reported (Zhang et al., 2015)—showed opposite regulation in the wild type and the mutant. The same was observed in the secretome for the DNA-repair Histone H2A and the scytalone dehydratase, the latter involved in the biosynthesis of DNH melanin from endogenous substrate (Eisenman and Casadevall, 2012), which were upregulated in the wild type and downregulated in the mutant. This is suggestive of increased measures for cell protection and is in line with the fact that melanin pigmentation and enhanced melanin synthesis is most often a feature of fungi living on space stations (Dadachova and Casadevall, 2008;De Middeleer et al., 2019). Further, versicolorin reductase (CF317_003229-T1), a protein mediating aflatoxins biosynthetic processes, was also decreased only in the mutant. Although production of aflatoxins inK. chersonesoshas hitherto not been reported, this finding can be indicative of reduced production of allergenic or toxic metabolites (e.g., polyketides). Also in the mutant, the upregulation of hydrolytic enzymes such as the alpha, alpha-trehalase suggests a recourse to store carbohydrates as a carbon source. By contrast, production of compounds that increase the osmotolerancy (e.g., trehalose) represents a quite common protective measure implemented by microorganisms under microgravity and other types of stress (Willaert, 2013). A number of proteins differentially expressed under simulated microgravity were involved in stress response, including glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH; CF317_004755-T1) and nitric oxide dioxygenase (NOD; CF317_006388-T1), over-represented in the proteome of both fungi, and chemical stress component proteins with proteolytic and phosphatase activity. While its role as a stress-responsive enzyme was speculated for GDH (i.e., ROS) (Skopelitis et al., 2006), NOD participates in mechanisms of detoxification of nitric oxide, a gas with multiple roles in cellular metabolism ranging from defense to signaling. The observation of peptidases, which were enriched inK. chersonesosWt proteome under exposure to LSSMG, may instead suggest the removal of damaged proteins to enhance cellular fitness and maximize survival (Bonham-Carter et al., 2013;Zhang et al., 2015). In this respect, it should be noted that a role of altered gravity in the breakdown of protein structures has been previously reported (Trotter et al., 2015). However, a major part of detected stress response proteins involved in cell redox homeostasis, glutathione metabolism and recycling and osmotic stress defense—i.e., catalases, glutathione reductases, 3-phytases and s-formylglutathione hydrolases—appeared to be decreased under exposure to LSSMG. As previously suggested in plants (Zhang et al., 2015), downregulation of general stress response proteins under microgravity might indicate an impaired activation of the defense response components. However, decreased levels of common stress proteins and lack of a heat shock response (HSP) represent a key component of black fungi response to a variety of suboptimal conditions of growth and have been attributed to an energy-saving strategy that relies on a fine-tuning regulation of protein abundance (Tesei et al., 2012,2015;Zakharova et al., 2013,2014;Blasi et al., 2017). One further interesting aspect was the high number of proteins traditionally recognized as cytoplasmic inK. chersonesossecretome, especially in the mutant (i.e., 6% of total secreted proteins with predicted signal peptide v/s 25% in the wild type; 20% of regulated secreted proteins had signal peptides in both strains). Such a discrepancy between wild type and mutant was also reported in a study ofK. chersonesossecretome aimed at the screening for novel polyesterases (Tesei et al., 2020), hence it seems to suggest that a low number of extracellular proteins may be a peculiarity of the mutant secretome. The presence of cytoplasmic proteins in the culture supernatant may indicate that the mutant is more prone to cell lysis than the wild type (Miura and Ueda, 2018). However, given that proteins with no signal peptide (leaderless) can also be found in the secreted fraction as a result of non-classical protein secretion, e.g., via EVs-mediated pathways (Vallejo et al., 2012;Sun and Su, 2019), it may as well indicate co-isolation of vesicle proteins and classical secretory proteins during sample preparation procedures. These proteins (e.g., ribosomal proteins, proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism, response to stress, signaling, cell division and transport, etc.), for which vesicular transport might be the only route of extracellular delivery, are generally predicted as non-secretory (Bleackley et al., 2019). Together, the aspects of protein modulation observed inK. chersonesosWt and Mut suggest that the basic energy metabolism was upregulated in the Wt strain. Here, rearrangements of the protein repertoire resembled the classic response to microgravity, but with no evidence of significant activation of stress components or starvation response. The mutant mostly engaged in protein downregulation, without affecting their cell growth and survivability. This study therefore indicates the ability of black fungi to cope with microgravity conditions and suggests that cell wall melanization may ultimately influence the metabolic response to microgravity. Point mutation will be needed to confirm whether mutagenesis played a role in protein downregulation inK. chersonesosMut. To further our understanding about the impact of microgravity on ribosome biogenesis and protein translation, future work shall involve proteomics workflows such as radio-labeled protein expression assays.
