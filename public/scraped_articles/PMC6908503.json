Kiss,jzkiss@uncg.edu This article was submitted to Plant Abiotic Stress, a section of the journal Frontiers in Plant Science Received 2019 Jul 19; Accepted 2019 Nov 12; Collection date 2019. Plants have evolved under the influence of Earth'’s gravity, a force of “1g.” This ubiquitous force affects plant growth, development, and morphology at all levels, from the molecular to the whole plant (Vandenbrink et al., 2014). In addition, gravity underlies other physical phenomena like buoyancy, convection, and sedimentation, which affect many physical and chemical processes and therefore also shape plant growth and development. For example, buoyancy affects gas exchange, cellular respiration, and photosynthesis, but itself is a function of varying densities (Braun et al., 2018). Studying the direct and indirect effects of gravity on plant growth, however, is complicated by the difficulty of changing gravity on Earth. One means of reducing gravity'’s influence is to establish free fall and eliminate the effect of gravity either for a few seconds in so-called drop towers and parabolic flights or for the long term by using orbital free fall, which creates weightlessness. This condition is achieved by the balance between Earth'’s gravity and the velocity required to maintain free fall (Kiss, 2015). Experiments focusing on plant growth and development have been carried out in this environment almost from the advent of human spaceflight in the 1960s (Wolverton and Kiss, 2009;Vandenbrink and Kiss, 2016). Fascinating insights into plant biology have been provided by spaceflight studies aboard orbiting spacecraft. For instance, at the cell/molecular level, changes in the cell cycle (Manzano et al., 2009;Matía et al., 2010) and the cell wall (Soga et al., 2002;Johnson et al., 2015) have been observed when plants develop in microgravity. Recently, there have been a plethora of spaceflight experiments on the effects of varying gravity levels on gene expression in plants (Paul et al., 2012;Correll et al., 2013;Kwon et al., 2015;Johnson et al., 2017;Paul et al., 2017;Choi et al., 2019). And facilitated by the absence of significant gravitational accelerations in spaceflight, novel mechanisms of phototropism (Molas and Kiss, 2009) have been discovered in flowering plants (Millar et al., 2010;Kiss et al., 2012;Vandenbrink et al., 2016). On the applied side of plant space research, there has also been progress on cultivating plants for use in bioregenerative life support systems (Braun et al., 2018). Clinostats have been developed since gravity was identified as a major contributor of plant growth and development by Knight, Sachs, and Ciesielski in the late 1800s (reviewed inHoson et al., 1997;van Loon 2007;Hasenstein, 2009;Herranz et al., 2013). A clinostat is a device that rotates specimens around one or more axes. A number of different types of clinostats have been used to study plant growth and development as well as to address basic issues in fundamental biology. These clinostats can be divided into several types: one-axis clinostats with slow (1–4 rpm) or fast (50–120 rpm) rotation and clinostats with two or three axes of rotation. If the rate of rotation for the axes varies, such systems are distinguished as random positioning machines (RPMs). In addition to these instruments, magnetic levitation has been used to balance gravity (Kamal et al., 2016). The first experiments to expose plants to altered gravity environments were performed nearly 160 years before humans reached low-Earth orbit. Early in the 19th century, T.A. Knight used a water wheel as a centrifuge to expose oat seedlings to variable acceleration, demonstrating that plants were indeed sensing this physical force when carrying out “geotropic” growth (Knight, 1806). Later in the same century, Sachs developed a device, which he named a “klinostat,” to alter theeffectsof gravity by constantly rotating its longitudinal axis horizontally, thereby averaging the presumed effect of the gravitational force over the rotated axis (Sachs, 1882). A standard two-dimensional clinostat used to growMedicagoseedlings (green arrows) at 1 rpm.Blue arrowindicated the direction of rotation.Scale bar, 10.5 cm. In addition to their use as a means of minimizing the unidirectional effects of gravity, several studies have incorporated modified versions of the clinostat that expose the axial organ to a fractionalgtreatment either through a programmed rotation pattern or through the incorporation of a centrifuge as the innermost rotating axis of the clinostat. These instruments have been key in estimating the threshold acceleration necessary to activate gravity perception and growth responses (Shen-Miller et al., 1968;Brown et al., 1995;Laurinavicius et al., 1998;Galland et al., 2004;Duemmer et al., 2015;Bouchern-Dubuisson et al., 2016;Frolov et al., 2018), as well as identifying cellular-level responses of plants to microgravity (Murakami and Yamada, 1988;Kraft et al., 2000;Dauzart et al., 2016;Manzano et al., 2018) and the persistence of the gravity stimulus (John and Hasenstein, 2011). Long-term experiments on clinostats are particularly challenging because as the organs increase in mass, the changing weight distribution will cause bending stresses and other non-random mechanical stimulation that will vary as a function of the specific load-bearing structure of each organ. Thus, growing plants on a rotating clinostat can result in mechanical stress (van Loon, 2007;Manzano et al., 2009). The use of clinostats to study developmental effects of gravity are also limited because of their inability to control for constantly changing loads and rotational forces, thus restricting their usefulness with plants mainly to studies of directional growth responses. Thus, many factors, such as weighting distribution and rotation velocity, need to be considered when designing clinostats for life science experiment (Brown et al., 1996). Despite these disadvantages, the simplicity and availability of clinostats are the main reasons that these devices are the most common approach to attempt to simulate altered gravity conditions. Although the artifacts associated with clinostats require caution of the assessment of gravitational effects, they can provide valuable comparisons with space experiments and have been widely used by many researchers (e.g.,Brown et al., 1995;Kraft et al., 2000). Slow-rotating clinostats as described above simply consider the overall geometry and develop a scheme of rotation that fulfills certain conditions (such as centrifugal accelerations less than 10−3g). However, fast-rotating clinostats (typically 50–120 rpm) also utilize the path of sedimentation in a fluid, usually an aqueous growth medium for small (<1 mm) organisms (Aleshcheva et al., 2016;Warnke et al., 2016). In liquids, sedimentation and a relatively slow rotation result in potentially significant artifacts including spirally movements from centrifugation, sedimentation, and a viscosity-dependent Coriolis force. When the speed of rotation is increased as in a fast-rotating clinostat, sedimentation of a particle will be less than the movement of the liquid, thereby resulting in a reduced radius that finally produces a smaller diameter than the size of the particle or a cell. Thus, in the conditions as found in the fast-rotating clinostat, the rotation stabilizes the fluid around the particle, which in turn eliminates the gravity effects for all practical purposes. While the fast-rotating clinostat can provide conditions that mimic weightlessness very well, it is limited to small organisms such as unicells or bacteria but, generally, not applicable for plant studies (Cogoli, 1992). Non-Uniformly Rotating Clinostats Motion profile of a an object experiencing fractional gravity as a result of non-uniform rotation. The trace of a point rotating around an axis shows an extended resting position during phase T1. The ratio between the dwell time in the bottom position (T1) and complete rotation (T0) corresponds to the fractional gravity experienced by plants, provided that the dwell time does not exceed the gravity perception time. Three random positioning machines (RPMs) each with two independently driven perpendicular frames. The discrete rotation axes allow the implementation of slip rings to provide power and exchange data with the experiment that can be mounted onto the inner frame. Both the full-sized RPM(A)and the two desktop models(B)are shown with 10-cm square Petri dishes (pd). The diameter of the disk (asterisk) on the full-sized RPM is 40 cm and provides the generation of partial gravity.

Plastid position in central columella cells of root tips ofArabidopsisseedlings grown on the ground (GR), during spaceflight (FL), on a random positioning machine (RPM), and on a clinostat (CL). These cells are involved in gravity perception (Kiss, 2000). There is no statistical difference (P> 0.05) between the FL and RPM samples as indicated by *, while the FL samples are significantly different (P< 0.05) from the CL specimens as indicaated by ** and determined by an ANOVA followed by a Tukey post-test. Additional research is needed to determine which systems best mimic reduced gravity conditions, especially for plants that occupy a large volume and are therefore affected by any gradient of rotational, inertial, or magnetic conditions. Despite the above-mentioned complications, the ability to produce partial or even excess gravity forces makes magnetic gradients an attractive alternative to clinostat-based research. As indicated earlier, the precise and narrow space that corresponds to the desired level makes studies on whole plants problematic because the compensation point averages all forces acting on the levitated object by susceptibility, density, and distance. Thus, the most valuable aspect of high-gradient magnetic fields is the ability to precisely move (levitate) cellular organelles, such as statoliths in roots (Kuznetsov and Hasenstein, 1996), hypocotyls (Kuznetsov and Hasenstein, 1997), rhizoids (Kuznetsov and Hasenstein, 2001), and seedlings (Hasenstein and Kuznetsov, 1999). In addition, magnetic levitation has been shown to be a useful ground-based proxy for microgravity in a number of other systems including osteoblast cells (Hammer et al., 2009),Drosophila melanogaster(Herranz et al., 2012), and bacteria (Dijkstra et al., 2010). Although it sounds somewhat counterintuitive, we can also explore the effects of microgravity by the application of centrifuges. This reduced gravity paradigm (RGP) is based on the premise that adaptations seen going from a hypergravity level to a lower gravity level are similar to changes seen going from 1gto microgravity (van Loon, 2016). Using such a paradigm, we are not focusing on the absolute acceleration values but rather on the responses generated due to the change between the two accelerations levels. The premise of such an experiment is that the plant sample has to be adapted and stable to a higher gravity level such as 2g. Then, as theg-level is lowered to 1g, the plant will respond to this reduced gravity level. It is hypothesized that the processes in such adaptations are of the same type as one would see going from 1ginto free fall, although the magnitude might be different. Thus, this reduced gravity paradigm is best used for stable and steady systems at a certain higherglevel combined with measuring a relatively fast responding phenomenon when reducing the acceleration load. Reduced or Partial Gravity Studies Numerous studies on plant growth and development have been performed in space (Wolverton and Kiss, 2009;Vandenbrink and Kiss, 2016). In contrast, we know little about plant physiology in reduced gravity environments, which are less than the normal 1gthat characterizes Earth-based studies. Reduced gravity can also be termed partial-gor fractional-g. The exploration of the Moon and Mars will be important in the future and will rely upon optimized plant cultivation because plants will be essential for life support systems (Kiss, 2014). Therefore, it is important to develop new knowledge about the biology of plants at the lunar and Martiang-levels, 0.17gand 0.38g, respectively. Studies on plants in partial gravity environments also can provide new information on basic biological questions such as what is the threshold of gravisensing in plants (e.g.,Kiss et al., 1989;Perbal, 2009;Duemmer et al., 2015). To establish partial gravity on-board sounding rockets or orbiting laboratories, a centrifuge is needed to produce the desired accelerations. Centrifuges can be used to generate any acceleration from near zero to 1g. Especially 1-gexperiments are valuable as in-flight controls, which provide context for the analyses of spaceflight experiments (Vandenbrink and Kiss, 2016). Fortunately, there are several facilities on the International Space Station (ISS) that are equipped with centrifuges, and the ISS can be used to study partial gravity effects on plant development. Plant Responses in Reduced or Partial Gravity in Spaceflight A series of experiments have recently been performed on the ISS withArabidopsis thalianaand have focused on 1) the interaction between gravitropism and phototropism in microgravity and fractional gravity (Kiss et al., 2012;Vandenbrink and Kiss, 2016;Vandenbrink et al., 2016) and 2) identification of the threshold for gravity perception in roots in the wild-type and starchless (pgm-1) mutants (Wolverton, in progress). These experiments utilized the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) which had onboard centrifuges allowing for gravitational ranges from microgravity to small fractions of agup to 1g(Kiss et al., 2014). The EMCS was decommissioned in 2017, but international space agencies have developed hardware such as Cell Biology Experiment Facility (CBEF) and Biolab support research at fractionalg(Brinckmann, 2012). Time course studies of positive phototropic curvature in seedlings ofArabidopsisat indicated gravity levels in a spaceflight experiment.Different lettersindicate significant differences among the plots.(A)Response of the shoot-like hypocotyls ofArabidopsisseedlings to red light. The response at 0.3gwas not significantly different from the value of the 1-gcontrol, and there was attenuation of red-light phototropism at 0.3gand 1g.(B)Response of the roots ofArabidopsisseedlings to red light. The responses at 0.1gand 0.3gwere not significantly different from the value of the 1-gcontrol, and these values were attenuated compared to the robust response in microgravity.

Plant Responses to Simulated Partial or Reduced Gravity Using Analogs While the main focus of this paper has been on the simulation of microgravity, we also see that there is potential to use the analog devices to simulate partial or reduced gravity conditions that are found on the Moon and Mars (Kiss, 2014). This approach has been recently used in RPM studies of the effects of simulated partial gravity on the balance between cell growth and cell proliferation during early plant development (Manzano et al., 2018). In another recent study usingArabidopsistissue culture cells, cell proliferation and growth were uncoupled under simulated reduced gravity also using an RPM (Kamal et al., 2018). Numerous studies have compared the biological effects of clinostats and other microgravity analogs to space experiments (e.g.,Brown et al., 1996;Kraft et al., 2000;Herranz et al., 2013;Huang et al., 2018). The experiments to date suggest that while these devices may be useful tools in some cases, there are great differences observed between plants that grow and develop on these devices and plants that are grown in weightlessness during spaceflight. In fact, rotation on certain types of clinostats may have deleterious effects in some biological systems (Hensel and Sievers, 1980;Kozeko et al., 2018;Ruden et al., 2018). Nevertheless, in this era of the International Space Station, we must take advantage of its unique facilities to compare effects observed in clinostats and other space simulators. We also should use the centrifuges available on the ISS to systematically explore the effects of partial gravity on plant growth and development. Understanding plant biology in space under different gravity levels will be useful as we develop technologies needed for human habitation of other worlds. JK wrote the first draft of the manuscript.
