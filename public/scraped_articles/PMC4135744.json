Nicholson,WLN@ufl.edu. Present address: José A. Robles-Martínez, Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority, Sydney, NSW, Australia. Received 2014 Mar 14; Accepted 2014 May 23. Studies of how microorganisms respond to pressure have been limited mostly to the extreme high pressures of the deep sea (i.e., the piezosphere). In contrast, despite the fact that the growth of most bacteria is inhibited at pressures below ∼2.5 kPa, little is known of microbial responses to low pressure (LP). To study the global LP response, we performed transcription microarrays onBacillus subtiliscells grown under normal atmospheric pressure (∼101 kPa) and a nearly inhibitory LP (5 kPa), equivalent to the pressure found at an altitude of ∼20 km. Microarray analysis revealed altered levels of 363 transcripts belonging to several global regulons (AbrB, CcpA, CodY, Fur, IolR, ResD, Rok, SigH, Spo0A). Notably, the highest number of upregulated genes, 86, belonged to the SigB-mediated general stress response (GSR) regulon. Upregulation of the GSR by LP was confirmed by monitoring the expression of the SigB-dependentctc-lacZreporter fusion. Measuring transcriptome changes resulting from exposure of bacterial cells to LP reveals insights into cellular processes that may respond to LP exposure. On Earth, there are a number of harsh environments that challenge microbial life due to extremes of fundamental physical factors, such as temperature, pressure, pH, or osmolarity. It is thus of prime importance to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms that enable microbes to grow and, indeed, to flourish at such physical extremes. Pressure is a fundamental thermodynamic parameter that affects biological processes and conditions at nearly every level, such as protein folding, the hydration state of molecules, enzyme reaction kinetics, membrane fluidity, and protein-nucleic acid binding affinity, to name but a few (1,2). High-pressure (HP) environments, ranging from those at sea level (∼101 kPa) to those at the depths of the Mariana Trench (∼100 MPa), are widespread beneath the world's oceans (i.e., the piezosphere). In contrast, hypobaric (i.e., low-pressure [LP]) environments are scarcely represented on Earth; nearly all surface life is located at the bottom of the troposphere, where the lowest terrestrial barometric pressure, at the top of Mt. Everest, is ∼34 kPa. However, recent reports of microbial metabolic processes occurring at high altitudes within clouds (3,4) are beginning to challenge this paradigm. Despite a lack of natural LP environments on the Earth's surface, knowledge of the microbiology of LP environments is gaining importance due to (i) the increasing use of hypobaric chambers for long-term storage of high-value perishable agricultural commodities (5), (ii) the sampling of microbes in the limits of the upper atmosphere (4,6–9), and (iii) the astrobiological implications of terrestrial microorganisms capable of living in extreme LP environments, such as those found on Mars (10,11). Current knowledge of bacterial pressure responses is confined mostly to studies of (i) hyperbaric, or piezophilic, microbes and (ii) exposure to HP of pressure mesophiles, such asEscherichia colior spores ofBacillusspp. (12–14). Ribosomal pyrosequencing analysis and culturing of deep-sea samples revealed that numerous species ofBacteria,Archaea, and micro-Eukaryaexist at HP in the deep-sea piezosphere (15). Various mechanisms that contribute to the adaptation of piezophilic microbes to growth at HP have been discovered or postulated, such as changes in the composition of permeases in the outer membrane (16), pressure-sensing mechanisms (17), differential expression of terminal oxidases (18), differences in the lipid composition of membranes (19–21), differences in the structure and amino acid composition of proteins (22), elongation of helical regions within 16S rRNA (23), and changes in enzymatic volumes (2,24–26). In contrast to the relative wealth of studies on how HP affects bacterial cells, there is a nearly complete lack of literature on mechanisms of microbial cellular responses to LP. Just as life over the entire range of extreme temperatures is represented by both cold- and heat-tolerant organisms, the study of the effect of HP on microbes alone does not fully describe the effects of pressure on cellular functions. The closest experimental analogue of the microbial cellular response to LP was a comparison of the transcriptomes of the piezophilic organismPhotobacterium profundumstrain SS9 when it was grown at atmospheric pressure (∼101 kPa) and when it was grown at HP (28 MPa) (27). This exposure of SS9 to a relatively low pressure resulted in the upregulation of transcripts involved in amino acid and ion transport, amino acid metabolism, and a variety of other cellular processes (27). To date, several bacterial species have been tested for growth and/or metabolism under various LP regimes (28–31). In most species tested, growth was observed to be essentially normal from ∼101 kPa down to 10 kPa, but the growth of most microorganisms slowed dramatically at pressures below 10 kPa and essentially ceased at 2.5 kPa (11,31). Two notable exceptions reported recently were sixCarnobacteriumisolates from Siberian permafrost (10) and a strain ofSerratia liquefaciensidentified in a screen of multiple laboratory strains of bacteria (11); both theCarnobacteriumisolates and theS. liquefaciensstrain were demonstrated to be able to grow at 0°C and 0.7 kPa in an anoxic, CO2-dominated atmosphere (i.e., a simulation of the Martian atmosphere). Growth of the model bacteriumBacillus subtilisis completely inhibited at 2.5 kPa and severely compromised at 5 kPa (11,32). In order to probe the global response ofB. subtilisto LP, we describe here transcription microarray experiments comparing the transcript levels of cells cultivated at 5 kPa and those of cells cultivated at ∼101 kPa. Bacterial strains, media, and growth conditions. Strains and plasmids used in this study Abbreviations: BGSC,BacillusGenetic Stock Center; →, transformation. Isolation and labeling of total RNA. Equivalent masses of WN624 cells, obtained from 10 ml or 100 ml of overnight cultures grown at ∼101 kPa or 5 kPa, respectively, were harvested by centrifugation, and the cell pellets were frozen at −70°C. Overnight cultures were used due to the low optical density after 24 h of growth at 5 kPa (OD660, ∼0.4 to 0.8). Approximately 4 × 109cells, estimated from the culture optical densities determined before centrifugation, were obtained from each sample. Total RNA was extracted from cells and treated with RNase-free DNase using a RiboPure-Bacteria kit (Ambion) following the manufacturer's protocol. The resulting RNA sample concentrations and purity were determined by measurement of the UV absorbance at 260 and 280 nm (40). RNA integrity numbers (RINs) (41) were obtained using an RNA 6000 Nano kit on an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies); the average RIN of total RNA samples was 9.71. Transcription microarray experiments. Total RNA samples were sent to the University of Florida Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research (UF-ICBR) for fluorescent labeling with Cy3 or Cy5 and microarray analyses. A custom glass slide microarray (GE 8x15K 60-mer; Agilent Technologies) was designed and built using theB. subtilisstrain 168 genome sequence (42). For each sample, approximately 12 μl of RNA at a concentration of 500 ng/μl was loaded for a total RNA content of 6 μg. For sample layouts, refer to Table S1 in the supplemental material.

Transcriptome analysis of strain WN624 at 5 kPa and ∼101 kPa. Summary of regulons with at least 10 target genes affecteda For a detailed list of all regulons affected, refer to Tables S2 and S3 in the supplemental material. The GSR regulon inB. subtilisconsists of ∼185 target genes, expression of which is induced in response to nutrient starvation and a variety of environmental stresses, such as heat, cold, ethanol, or salt (44,57,58). Transcriptional activation of GSR genes is under the control of the alternate sigma factor sigma B (σBor SigB), encoded by thesigBgene (44). ThesigBgene is located within thersbRSTUVW-sigB-rsbXoperon, with a SigB-dependent promoter embedded upstream ofrsbVallowing SigB-dependent transcriptional induction of the last four genes in the operon, including autoinduction ofsigB. The activity of SigB is regulated by the RsbW anti-sigma factor system and the RsbV anti-anti-sigma factor system in response to a complex system of regulators encoded by the upstreamrsbRSTUoperon and thersbXgene, whose products are responsive to various environmental stresses (44), andrsbPQ, whose products are involved in energy stress activation of the SigB response (59). Exposure of strain WN624 to an LP of 5 kPa resulted in a dramatic (∼35- to 55-fold) upregulation of mRNA levels for genes of thersbWV-sigB-rsbXoperon (Table S4 in the supplemental material) but not ofrsbRSTUorrsbPQtranscripts. Of the 185 target genes in the GSR regulon (listed in Table S4 in the supplemental material), 88 of these genes (genes with underlined names in Table S4 in the supplemental material) are known to be strictly dependent upon SigB for their induction (57,58,60). Of these, 63 (70%) were upregulated in the microarray measuring mRNA from cells exposed to 5 kPa compared with their regulation in the microarray measuring mRNA from cells exposed to ∼101 kPa (Fig. 1C, Table S4 in the supplemental material). In order to compare GSR gene expression resulting from LP exposure to that resulting from other physical stresses, we compared the LP-mediated GSR of strain WN624 to the global GSR ofB. subtilisexposed to ethanol, heat, or salt stress in previous studies (57,60,61) (Fig. 2). Very good concordance between the two responses was observed; LP exposure induced the upregulation of 86 genes, 70 of which (81%) were also induced by exposure to heat, ethanol, or salt (Fig. 2). Notably, 30 ethanol-, heat-, or salt-inducible GSR genes were not induced by LP, and LP exposure induced the expression of 16 genes not reported to be induced by ethanol, heat, or salt stress (Fig. 2), indicating that LP induced a GSR that only partially overlapped with that induced by ethanol, heat, or salt stress.

The numbers of genes belonging to each category is indicated in parentheses, and gene names are listed. Underlined genes are strictly SigB dependent (see Table S4 in the supplemental material and the text for details). Induction ofctc-lacZexpression by LP. Determination of LP induction of the SigB-dependent GSR using actc-lacZreporter fusion. The relevant genotypes of strains WN1400 (sigB+) and WN1407 (ΔsigB::spc) are denoted. (A)ctc-lacZexpression induced by 5% (vol/vol) ethanol or by exposure to 5 kPa (shaded bars) versus that in the uninduced controls (open bars). (B) Induction ofctc-lacZexpression at ∼101 kPa and various LPs (50, 25, 10, and 5 kPa) in strain WN1400 (sigB+). Data are averages and standard deviations for triplicate samples taken from two independent experiments. We were interested in determining the level of LP required to trigger the SigB-dependent GSR, so we measured the expression of thectc-lacZfusion in strain WN1400 (sigB+) at pressures of ∼101, 50, 25, 10, and 5 kPa (Fig. 3B). Strain WN1400 did not inducectc-lacZexpression until the pressure was lowered to either 10 or 5 kPa (Fig. 3B). Inactivation ofsigBdoes not alter fitness at ∼101 kPa or at 5 kPa. Relatively little is known about how hypobaria affects cellular processes or how microbial life is affected by and responds to LP. In this study, we found by microarray experiments thatBacillus subtilisstrain WN624 sensed and responded to LP stress by activation of at least a dozen known regulons, including the SigB-mediated GSR, and this notion was confirmed by the SigB-dependent induction ofctc-lacZfusion expression by exposure of cells to LP. The nonoptimal pressure responses of both piezophiles grown at standard atmospheric pressure (27) and pressure mesophiles grown at elevated pressures (14) are known to be the induction of stress response genes, such as heat and cold shock proteins. In this communication, we show that exposure of a pressure mesophile to LP upregulated several global regulons, including the SigB-dependent GSR. It was interesting to note that strain WN624 did not induce the GSR until the pressure was lowered to 10 kPa, the equivalent of the pressure at an altitude of ∼18 km, over twice the height of Mt. Everest (8,848 m). As stated previously, the known biosphere is contained within the troposphere, where the low-pressure limit is ∼10 kPa (62). Interestingly, this is also the lower limit of pressure before significant decreases in growth rate and colony size were demonstrated in a number of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial species (10,11,29,31). Therefore, it appears for most bacteria (with a few notable recent exceptions mentioned above [10,11]) that there exists a low-pressure limit at ∼10 kPa, below which cellular processes begin to be inhibited and the GSR is induced inB. subtilis. As observed previously with other environmental stresses (ethanol, heat, high salt), the SigB-mediated GSR does not seem to be required for growth at 5 kPa. This does not rule out the possibility that a stress-related, SigB-independent gene(s) might be necessary forB. subtilisgrowth at LP. Future experiments to address this issue are in progress. Toward an understanding of the LP response. One consequence of lowering the headspace pressure from ∼101 to 5 kPa is to lower the partial pressure of oxygen in the medium by a factor of roughly 20; this might immediately lead to induction of the anaerobic response involving the ResD, Fnr, and Rex regulons (see Tables S2 and S3 in the supplemental material). These regulators in turn induce expression of a host of genes involved in fermentation and anaerobic respiration. However, because Miller LB medium lacks fermentable sugars or alternative electron acceptors, such as nitrate, cessation of growth and entrance into stationary phase rapidly ensue. Entrance into stationary phase activates the SigB-mediated GSR as well as a number of regulators of the transition state, such as AbrB/Adh, CodY, Rok, Spo0A, and SigH; in addition, CcpA has been shown to remodel carbon metabolism in the early stationary phase (63). Induction of IolR by LP is difficult to fit into this scheme because IolR is not a global regulator but is a specific regulator of genes involved inmyo-inositol catabolism (the operonsiolABCDEFGHIJandiolRSand theiolTgene) (56). However, expression of this small regulon has also been documented to be strongly induced upon entrance into the stationary phase (64). In summary, exposure ofB. subtilisto LP activates a large number of responses, including the SigB-dependent GSR. At present, it is known that activation ofsigBexpression can occur in response to three pathways responsive to energy stress (65); exposure to physical stresses, such as ethanol, heat, or high salt (34); or cold stress (35). Determining which signaling pathway(s) is induced by LP will shed further insight into how the GSR is induced, directly or indirectly, by LP and is a course for future work.
