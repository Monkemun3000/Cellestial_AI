Significant efforts are being made for the human exploration of space. It is known that space conditions can negatively affect biological processes by causing bone loss, muscle atrophy, and immune system impairment, to name a few examples (reviewed in [1,2]). However, the underlying molecular mechanisms that contribute to these adverse effects is largely unknown. Microgravity is one of the major stress factors causing detrimental health effects on humans (reviewed in [3]). Simulation of microgravity is a cost-effective way to study the impact of microgravity on biological systems. For this purpose, various platforms including drop towers, parabolic flights and space flights are available. Because of their advantages to enable long term simulations in an effective and economical manner, clinostats are widely preferred to study gravitational response in biological systems, mainly plants, for decades [4,5,6,7,8]. Clinostats rotate a sample around a horizontal axis, thereby exposing the sample to a rotating gravitational vector. This can reduce and even possibly remove gravitational bias in the development of an organism [6,9,10,11,12,13]. C. elegansis an exceptional model organism for space biology studies [14] with its completely documented cell lineage, high reproduction rate, short lifespan, and high similarity to the human genome (reviewed in [15]). The usage of this organism in previous space missions (such as InternationalC. elegansExperiment in Space (ICE-First),C. elegansRNAi space experiment (CERISE), Shenzhou-8, and Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus Science Insert-01 (CSI-01)) have provided valuable insights into the biological response ofC. elegansto space conditions [16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24]. However, these studies generally have utilized different strains and liquid cultures instead of commonly used OP50-seeded agar plates to reduce the impact of surface tension [25]. We previously have shown that the usage of different liquid cultures and strains cause highly distinct intergenerational transcriptomic and phenotypical responses [26]. Similarly, a recent study reported dramatical intergenerational changes in the physiology of liquid-grown worms [27]. Thus, complementary to the spaceflight studies, separate investigations can provide insight into the impact of individual space conditions on biological processes. 2.1. C. elegans Strain and Growth Conditions 2.2. RNA Isolation, Illumina Sequencing Wild-type N2 strain was obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center (University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, MN, USA). The worms were grown at 21 °C. Stocks ofC. eleganswere acclimated to CeHR medium for three weeks prior to microgravity experiments. Approximately 100,000 live worms (P0 generation) were cleaned by sucrose floatation, their embryos (F1 generation) were harvested by bleaching and placed in ~40 mL of CeHR medium in sterile VueLife culture bags (“AC” Series 32-C, Saint-Gobain, La Défense Cedex, France). Four culture bags were mounted in a lab-built clinostat inside a laminar flow biosafety hood, and one was kept aside as a ground control. The clinostat rotated the culture bags at 1 rad/s (~10 RPM) for four days, which is the measured time to reach L4/adulthood at 21 °C in CeHR medium [28]. Worms from one bag were immediately harvested to represent simulated microgravity conditions. The remaining three culture bags were processed in four-day intervals to represent the return to ground conditions. We note that F2 generation and beyond will not maintain synchronicity, and all will contain a mixture of generations, but recovering only the live animals enriches the RNA pool for the expected (majority) generation as each adult will produce ~30 offspring in CeHR culture. The experimental scheme is limited to using mixed stage worms because of the technical difficulties associated with manually picking the desired age (swimming) worms from liquid cultures. Live worms were selected for harvesting by sucrose floatation and total RNA was isolated with TRIzol treatment and recovered by alcohol precipitation. Total RNA was further purified by PureLink ™ RNA Mini Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Two micrograms of total RNA were used for library preparations using the TruSeq Stranded mRNA LT Sample Prep Kit (Illumina). Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 instrument set to the rapid run mode using single-end, 1 × 51 cycle sequencing reads as per manufacturer’s instructions. RNA-seq was performed for each condition with three replicates. 2.4. Functional Analysis of the Genes Gene ontology (GO) enrichment for biological processes and protein domains were assessed with Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) (v6.8) [35]. The GO network for the common DEGs between our simulated microgravity experiment and four-day CERISE was created in Cytoscape (version 3.4.0) [36] by using the BINGO plugin [37]. Pathway analysis was done using KEGG Mapper (https://www.genome.jp/kegg/tool/map_pathway1.html(accessed on 1 January 2019)). Tissue enrichment analysis was performed by using WormBase Gene Set Enrichment Analysis tool [38], and FDR adj.p-value < 0.05 considered significant and top ten tissues were reported. 2.5. Comparison of DEGs to the CERISE Four Days NASA’s GeneLab (https://genelab.nasa.gov/(accessed on 1 January 2019)) platform was used to acquire the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) accession number for the previous studies on microgravity related gene expressions inC. elegans. We identified four such studies with the following GEO accession numbers:GSE71771(Expression Data from InternationalC. elegansExperiment 1st),GSE71770(four-day CERISE),GSE27338(eight-day CERISE), andGSE32949by UKM (PRJNA146465) from the query made on 30 June 2016 with “C. elegans” and “microgravity” terms on GeneLab. We used data from only four-day CERISE as the duration of the study is the same with ours. We analyzed the publicly available microarray datasets with GEO2R (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/geo2r/(accessed on 1 January 2019)) for gene expression under microgravity at the ISS versus 1G control in four day CERISE. The genes with logFC > 2 and Benjamini and Hochberg correctedp-value < 0.05 were considered as differentially expressed. 2.6. Mass Spectrometry for Ceramides 2.7. Microgravity Simulation with Clinorotation We used a laboratory-built clinostat with an integrated microscope to observe the motion of small objects including microspheres, yeast cells, andC. elegansembryos during clinorotation. The trajectory of a spherical particle in a rotating vessel has been described previously in literature [5,11,42,43]. Dedolph and Dipert (1971) separated the motion of a spherical particle into two parts: a circular motion under the influence of gravity, the radius of which is inversely proportional to the angular velocity (ω, rad/s), and a radial motion due to centrifugal forces, the velocity of which is proportional toω2[42]. The equation of motion that describes the orbital trajectories is given by: In the above equation,λis the viscous drag coefficient,mis the mass of the object,mwis the mass of the displaced water,tis time,gis the acceleration due to gravity, andq(x,y,z,t) is the rotating reference frame defined as: Transcriptomic response ofC. elegansto simulated microgravity and return to ground conditions.

Simulated Microgravity-Induced Gene Expression Differences Are Highly Maintained for Eight Days after Return to Ground Conditions 3.3. Longevity Regulating Pathways Are Affected under Simulated Microgravity Longevity regulating pathway genes are differentially expressed under simulated microgravity. Adopted from the KEGG longevity regulating pathway—worm (cel04212). The upregulation of the longevity regulating pathway transcriptional targets generally contributes to increased lifespan. Since many of these targets were downregulated under simulated microgravity, we sought to identify the potential impact of their downregulation by acquiring their RNAi phenotype from WormBase [34]. Lifespan variants (WBRNAi00063155 and WBRNAi00063156) forhsp-12.6and extended lifespan (WBRNAi00064044) forsod-3have been reported. Follow-up experiments are needed to fully understand the role of these genes in the longevity regulation under simulated microgravity. 3.4. Sphingolipid Signaling Pathway Is Suppressed in Response to Simulated Microgravity Sphingolipid signaling pathway is downregulated under simulated microgravity. (a) The sphingolipid signaling pathway genesasah-1,asm-3, andgba-4are downregulated under simulated microgravity. The downregulation pattern ofasm-3andgba-4is maintained for eight days after return to ground conditions. (b) The levels of d18:1 sphingosine, total ceramide, hexosylceramide, and sphingoid base reduced while total lactosylceramide level increased under simulated microgravity. (c) The levels of different acyl-chain ceramides show alterations under simulated microgravity. The error bars represent the standard error of the mean (*p< 0.05, **p< 0.01, ***p< 0.001). Along with their roles in aging and longevity, different acyl-chain ceramides have other distinctive functions. For example, C16-ceramide induces germ cell apoptosis [61] and C20–C22 ceramide functions in resistance to hypoxia [60]. We determined that ceramides with different acyl-chain showed altered levels in response to simulated microgravity. While d18:1-C16 and d18:1-C18 exhibited a decrease (2.8- and 1.6-fold, respectively), d18:1-C20 and d18:1-C22 ceramides exhibited an increase (3.7- and 1.5-fold, respectively) under simulated microgravity (t-test,p-value < 0.05). Collectively, our findings suggest that sphingolipid and insulin/IGF-1 pathways play a role in simulated microgravity response. 3.5. Identification of the Common Microgravity-Responsive Genes between Four-Day CERISE and Simulated Microgravity In this study, we examined the simulated microgravity responsive gene expression patterns and their maintained levels for four, eight, and twelve days after return to ground conditions. Longevity regulating pathways such as insulin/IGF-1 and sphingolipid signaling were affected under simulated microgravity. We identified the putative microgravity-responsive genes by determining the common microgravity responsive transcriptomic signatures by incorporating our study to a previous one with the same exposure time. Moreover, we revealed that the microgravity-responsive genes are potentially conserved between worms and humans by performing function analysis for the human orthologs of the worm microgravity-responsive genes and identifying some of their potential transcriptional regulators. We are grateful to Michael Moore for his help developing the clinostat. İÇ acknowledges the University of Delaware for Dissertation Fellowship and Graduate Fellow Award.
