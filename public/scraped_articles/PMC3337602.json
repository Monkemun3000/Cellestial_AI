Globus:ruth.k.globus@nasa.gov Academic Editor: Sharmila Bhattacharya Received 2011 Aug 6; Revised 2011 Nov 12; Accepted 2011 Nov 29; Issue date 2012. Osteoporosis can profoundly affect the aged as a consequence of progressive bone loss; high-dose ionizing radiation can cause similar changes, although less is known about lower doses (≤100 cGy). We hypothesized that exposure to relatively low doses of gamma radiation accelerates structural changes characteristic of skeletal aging. Mice (C57BL/6J-10 wk old, male) were irradiated (total body; 0-sham, 1, 10 or 100 cGy137Cs) and tissues harvested on the day of irradiation, 1 or 4 months later. Microcomputed tomography was used to quantify microarchitecture of high turnover, cancellous bone. Irradiation at 100 cGy caused transient microarchitectural changes over one month that were only evident at longer times in controls (4 months).Ex vivobone cell differentiation from the marrow was unaffected by gamma radiation. In conclusion, acute ionizing gamma irradiation at 100 cGy (but not at 1 cGy or 10 cGy) exacerbated microarchitectural changes normally found during progressive, postpubertal aging prior to the onset of age-related osteoporosis. Osteoporosis can lead to devastating health consequences and poses a substantial health care burden currently affecting an estimated 44 million Americans (NIH). In women, estrogen deficiency is primarily responsible for the rapid postmenopausal loss of bone mass and resulting structural fragility (type I osteoporosis) while a slower bone loss (type II or senile osteoporosis) affects both men and women late in life [1]. Bone structure begins to decline early [2]; peak bone mass is achieved in early adulthood and progressively declines in both high turnover, cancellous tissue and in the surrounding hard cortical shell. The compartments of bone affected by osteoporosis can include both the dense tissue that forms an outer structural shell (cortical bone) and the spongy tissue (cancellous bone) within the marrow cavity; the microarchitecture of cancellous bone is profoundly affected in osteoporosis and renders sites that are rich in cancellous tissue, such as the spine and proximal femur, prone to fracture. An age-related decline in cancellous tissue structure occurs in rodents over a matter of months, rather than years, as in humans. C57BL/6J mice provide a well-established animal model with relatively rapid postpubertal loss of cancellous tissue [3,4], characteristic of that which precedes the development of senile, type II osteoporosis in humans. Bone turnover is regulated by a balance between the activities of bone-forming osteoblasts and bone-resorbing osteoclasts. Osteoblasts progressively differentiate from progenitors and mesenchymal stem cells whereas osteoclasts are haematopoietic derivatives of the monocyte/macrophage lineage. Stem cells, progenitors, and precursors of both lineages reside within the bone marrow. Bone marrow cells culturedex vivoretain behavioral characteristics ofin vivofunction; thus bone marrow-derived cells cultured under conditions tailored either to stimulate osteoblast differentiation (osteoblastogenesis) or osteoclast differentiation (osteoclastogenesis) are useful tools to dissect cellular and molecular bases of physiological challenges such as skeletal aging and exposure to radiation [5–8]. Ionizing radiation generates reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) both by the ionization of target molecules and by perturbations to the cellular redox state, also implicated in the development of osteoporosis [9–12]. The production of ROS/RNS causes oxidative damage to DNA, lipids, and protein influencing key cell functions, including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Low Linear Energy Transfer (LET) ionizing radiation (e.g., gamma rays, X-rays) at high cumulative doses (>200 cGy) can damage vascular supply (osteoradionecrosis), leading to loss of cortical and cancellous tissue and leading to skeletal fragility [13], while adverse effects of lower doses (100–200 cGy) appear to be confined to cancellous tissue in animal models [12,14–16]. Much less is known about how low doses influence skeletal health. Here we hypothesized that low-to-moderate doses of ionizing radiation accelerate postpubertal and progressive loss of microarchitectural integrity over time. Ionizing radiation at 100 cGy (but not at 1 cGy or 10 cGy) caused structural changes in cancellous tissue within one month that occurred over 4 months in controls, with no further decrements following 1 month. The capability of marrow-derived cell populations to differentiate into osteoblasts or osteoclasts was unaffected. 2.2. Cancellous Microarchitecture Skeletal microarchitecture broadly characterizes the 3D network of cancellous (or spongy) bone. Microcomputed tomography (vivaCT 40, SCANCO Medical AG, Brüttisellen, Switzerland) allows direct quantification of the microarchitecture of mineralized tissue (10.5μm voxel size) within the proximal tibia metaphysis [17]. Standard indices [18] were generated within the excised right tibia in a region 0.2 to 1.2 mm distal to the proximal growth plate via semiautonomous contouring of cross-sectional slices, as reported in detail previously [15]. The relative amount of bone to total volume (BV/TV, bone volume fraction) quantifies the amount of bone present. The thickness of the bony struts, the thickness (or spacing) of the marrow voids, and trabecular number characterize trabecular morphologys on average [19]. Connectivity density quantifies the number of trabecular struts per volume in the bony network [20]. The structure model index measures the ratio of rod-like (=3) to plate-like (=0) trabeculae within the tissue [19]. The fabric tensor quantifies the anisotropic orientation of the structure, relating to mechanical properties [21,22], with three eigenvalues describing the axial lengths of the anisotropy ellipsoid and the degree of anisotropy equaling the ratio of the maximum to minimum eigenvalues. 2.3. Primary Bone Marrow Culture Marrow cells from the hindlimbs (femora and tibiae) were grown as previously described [7]. In brief, cells were flushed from the bone marrow and plated inα-MEM supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum with osteoblastogenic supplements (ascorbate 50μg/mL, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) andβ-glycerophosphate (10 mM, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). For osteoclastogenesis, cells were plated overnight in macrophage colony stimulating factor (MCSF, 30 ng/mL, R&D Systems Inc, Minneapolis, MN) and nonadherent cells collected, replated, and grown inα-MEM supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum with MCSF (30 ng/mL) and soluble receptor activator of nuclear factorκB ligand (sRANKL, 60 ng/mL, Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ). Osteoclastogenesis was assessed 4-5 days after euthanasia by counting the number of multinucleated, tartrate resistant acid phosphatase-positive (TRAP+, Sigma Aldrich) cells in a defined area by microscopy (between 18 and 45 mm2) to count a minimum of 200 cells. Osteoblastogenesis was assessed one month after irradiation by quantifying the surface area covered by alizarin red-stained, mineralized nodules. Statistical analyses were performed using JMP 8 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). To address aging, three groups of sham controls were collected at different time points for analysis. Least squares linear regressions were performed with time as regressor and the null hypothesis of the slope being zero to assess changes over time. The coefficient of determination (R2) and the probability (P) of the slope being zero are reported, withP= 0.05 the threshold for rejecting the null hypothesis. For each time point after-irradiation, comparisons were made between the sham-irradiated and irradiated mice. Analyses proceeded using one-factor ANOVA with the Tukey-Kramer Honestly Significant Difference post hoc test, andP= 0.05 considered the threshold for significance. All figures report mean ± standard deviation (SD). Mouse body mass as a function of age and radiation exposure. Experiment to determine whether a single dose of137Cs gamma rays causes age-related changes in skeletal structure and bone cell differentiation. Male C57BL/6 mice (10 weeks of age,n= 8/group) were irradiated at 1, 10, and 100 cGy or were sham-irradiated (0 cGy) on day 0 and tissues harvested 1 month (inset) or 4 months after irradiation. Mean ± SD.#DenotesP< 0.05 for changes with age (linear regression) for the respective cohorts (1 and 4 months after irradiation). 3.2. Cancellous Microarchitecture: Temporal Changes Cancellous microarchitecture of the proximal tibial metaphysis as a function of age and radiation exposure at the time of irradiation (basal, 0 months) and 1 and 4 months after irradiation. During aging, sham-irradiated controls show relative bone volume (BV/TV) remaining constant (a), increases in tissue density (b) and trabecular thickness (Tb.Th*) (c), and declines in trabecular number (Tb.N*) (d) and connectivity density (Conn.D) (e). The ratio of trabecular rods to plates, the structure model index (SMI), remains constant with age (f). The maximum eigenvalue (|H2|) of the fabric tensor increases with age (g), with the degree of anisotropy (h) remaining constant. At 1 month after irradiation, 100 cGy reduced Tb.N* by 20% (d), Conn.D by 36% (e) compared to age-matched controls. Irradiation at 100 cGy, but not at 1 cGy or 10 cGy, altered cancellous structure within 1 month in a direction and magnitude similar to 4 months of normal aging, with no further modulation between 1 and 4 months after irradiation. Mean ± SD. *DenotesP< 0.05 for changes with IR dose (ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer posthoc compared to age-matched sham controls).#DenotesP< 0.05 for changes with age (linear regression). We observed age-related changes in the cancellous microarchitecture of the tibia within the 4-month timeframe. In our study, declines in trabecular number and connectivity density ensued, while relative bone volume, rod-like morphology and degree of anisotropy remained constant. Concurrently, the cancellous tissue consolidated gains into thicker and denser, though fewer, trabecular struts. Trabeculae were spaced farther apart with age (data not shown) and may increase the propensity for strut buckling [23,24]. These changes are consistent with normal aging of male C57BL/6 mice, including declines of trabecular number and connectivity density, which appeared to start sooner and fall more rapidly with aging than the bone volume fraction [3,4]. In sum, these data suggest that age-related alterations of microarchitecture within the mouse tibia may precede overt declines in cancellous bone volume. 3.3. Cancellous Microarchitecture: Ionizing Radiation-Induced Changes In this study, microarchitectural differences between irradiated and age-matched controls were not evident 4 months after exposure to 100 cGy radiation. This result contrasts to the persistence of osteopenia in the tibia after low LET irradiation at higher doses (≥200 cGy X-ray or gamma rays) or with particulate irradiation at doses of 100 cGy (proton) [25] and 200 cGy (56Fe) [14] which present at 120 days after-irradiation in female mice (9 weeks). These findings highlight the importance of age at the time of irradiation; gender also may influence skeletal radioresponses and further study is needed in this area. 3.4. Bone Cell Differentiation Potential Bone-cell differentiation potential as a function of age and radiation exposure. Hindlimb bone marrow was flushed and cultured under osteoblastogenic or osteoclastogenic conditions to assess differentiation potential of the marrow. Between 1 and 4 months of aging (white columns), osteoblastogenesis (a), measured as the area of calcified matrix per well, and osteoclastogenesis (b), measured as number of TRAP-positive, multinuclear (≥3/cell) cells per area, remained constant in sham-control mice. Irradiation, at any dose (gray or black columns), did not affect the differentiation potential of bone cells in the marrow at 1 (not shown) or 4 months post-IR (a, b). Images of alizarin red-stained mineralized nodules (c) and TRAP-stained osteoclasts (d). A limitation of this study design is that bones were analyzed at only two time points after exposure to radiation. Additional timepoints would be useful to further characterize the influence of radiation on age-related changes in skeletal health. Research was supported by a DOE-NASA Interagency Award no.
