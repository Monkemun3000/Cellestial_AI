In this article we report the identification of T-DNA (transfer DNA) insertion sites within two different gene regions in the genome of an Arabidopsis mutant line, SALK_084889. The T-DNA positions are in the 3â€² UTR (untranslated region) of DREB2A (Dehydration-responsive element-binding protein 2A) (AT5G05410) and promoter of LOX1 (Lipoxygenase 1) (AT1G55020) as determined by DNA-PCR and sanger sequencing. The expression levels of DREB2A and LOX1 were also analyzed using quantitative realtime PCR (qPCR) in SALK_084889 and wild type Arabidopsis (Col, Columbia). Further, the comparison of drought and heat tolerance between Col and SALK_084889 were conducted by stress treatments. The present data indicate that in SALK_084889, the expression of DREB2A is not downregulated under normal growth conditions but can be affected only in roots under drought treatment, while LOX1 is significantly downregulated in both roots and shoots under all tested conditions. These data are original and have not been published elsewhere. T-DNA insertion lines provide important resource for genetic analysis based on mutagenesis in plant research. SALK lines are the most widely used T-DNA insertion lines for the model plant Arabidopsis. Accurate assessment of insertions is critical for understanding the value of the insertion lines. SALK_084889 is annotated as a T-DNA insertion line ofDREB2A, a key regulator of drought and heat response in Arabidopsis. We characterizedDREB2Aexpression in normal and drought conditions in this line, which is relevant for analysis ofDREB2Amutants in further investigation. TheLOX1gene plays a critical role in multiple bioprocesses associated with lipid peroxidation. Our data identified a T-DNA insertion within promoter ofLOX1and showed the knock-out expression ofLOX1in SALK_084889. These are valuable information for mutation analysis ofLOX1.
