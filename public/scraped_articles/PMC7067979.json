Massa,gioia.massa@nasa.gov This article was submitted to Plant Abiotic Stress, a section of the journal Frontiers in Plant Science Received 2019 Oct 17; Accepted 2020 Feb 11; Collection date 2020. Crop production in space may be a necessary and desirable component of future exploration systems (MacElroy et al., 1992;Kliss et al., 2000). Fresh produce can be grownin situto supplement a stored, packaged diet, and crops may provide beneficial nutrients as well as dietary variety. Veggie is a small plant growth chamber designed and built by Orbital Technologies Corporation (Now Sierra Nevada Corp., Madison, WI, United States) to grow vegetable crops in space (Morrow et al., 2005;Morrow and Remiker, 2009). Veggie payload containing a crop of mature red romaine lettuce in Veggie pillows aboard the ISS with the light panel off(left)and red light panel on(right). Bellows are in the up position. A major focus of our research in the past several years has been to identify crop candidates with high potential for dietary supplementation, given the constraints associated with the current space diet. Ongoing testing has indicated that some essential human nutrients are either deficient in the processed and pre-packaged space foods (e.g., potassium, Vitamin K) or may degrade to inadequate levels over the times required for long duration missions (e.g., Vitamin B1, Vitamin C) (Cooper, 2013). Several of these nutrients may be supplemented through fresh salad crops and will provide antioxidants and phytochemicals in a natural, whole-food form. Previous studies with salad crops have focused on combinations of environmental conditions (e.g., light, temperature, CO2concentration) needed to optimize plant growth for space settings (Richards et al., 2004,2006). While the macro nutritional value of crops was often evaluated in productivity studies (calories, protein, fats, and carbohydrates), micro nutritional data are limited (McKeehen et al., 1996;Wheeler et al., 1996,1997). In order to utilize “pick-and-eat” produce such as the lettuce crops grown in VEG-01 and 03 as a supplemental food for space, nutritional assessment is essential. In this study we compare the nutritional quality of red romaine lettuce (Lactuca sativa, cv. Outredgeous) grown on ISS to ground controls grown under the same ISS environmental conditions including relative humidity, CO2concentration and temperature. Within a Veggie chamber, conditions such as humidity and temperature can vary from ISS conditions outside the chamber, for example, the temperature and humidity inside the Veggie tend to be slightly elevated compared to the open cabin air. These differences may have an impact on the elemental, nutritional and microbiological components of the plant. Increased temperatures have been shown to decrease macronutrient content in red leaf lettuce while increasing flavonoids and phenolics (Sublett et al., 2018). Studies have shown that increased humidity initiates a positive response in biomass yield in many agricultural crops while concomitantly decreasing transpiration rate altering the uptake of water and some nutrients (Tibbitts, 1979;Gislerød and Mortensen, 1990). Microbiological testing is an integral part of any food safety program to verify quality, production and proper handling processes but few studies exist for space grown plants (Hummerick et al., 2010). We conducted microbiological testing of Veggie-grown produce to understand potential risks to astronauts as consumers. Good agricultural practices and procedures are in place to minimize microbial contamination of crops grown in Veggie, and microbial testing is one tool to verify the effectiveness of these processes (Hummerick et al., 2011). Plant-growth conditions, the surrounding environment, mineral nutrition, and plant species can all influence the microbial populations living on plant surfaces (Lindow and Brandl, 2003). A variety of microorganisms can be found on fresh produce, most as part of the normal flora of the plant with no adverse effect on humans if consumed (Heaton and Jones, 2008;Leff and Fierer, 2013;Oyinlola et al., 2017). Microbiological analysis can also provide insight on the microbial ecology (population density and types of bacteria and fungi) of Veggie-grown plants. The likelihood of contamination and growth of potential human pathogens on plants grown in Veggie is low since sterilization/sanitization of seeds, plant growth medium, irrigation water, and hardware can be controlled. However, if a contamination event were to occur, the risks to the crew of exposure to food borne pathogens could be increased considering the association of immune dysregulation to spaceflight (Borchers et al., 2002). Heterotrophic bacterial counts and the presence of Enterobacteriaceae that serve as an indicator of contamination of processed foods, irrigation water, and food processing surfaces are frequently present in raw foods like fresh produce making those tests irrelevant as risk indicators for fruits and vegetables (Heaton and Jones, 2008;Leff and Fierer, 2013). The microbial load on crops intended for consumption by astronauts presumably should fall within an acceptable range of microbiological standards set for food. Currently, however, there are no standards in place for microbial levels in fresh produce grown in space. The closest related NASA standards are for non-thermostabilized food items including any of the freeze dried foods consumed in orbit, e.g., shrimp cocktail, chocolate candy, granola bars. For example, the current limit for aerobic bacteria on a non-thermostabilized food item is <2 × 104colony-forming units (CFU) per gram on one sample or <1 × 104on two out of five samples (Perchonok et al., 2012) however, these standards apply to prepackaged food sent from Earth. For fresh produce grown on ISS, the microbiological acceptability is assessed on a case-by-case basis relying on microbiological analysis of crops grown in ground studies analogous to Veggie grown crops. Microbiological analysis has been performed previously on edible plants grown in the Russian Lada chamber on ISS (Hummerick et al., 2010,2011). Mizuna, barley and radish from Lada were stored at −80°C after harvest until analysis was performed at Kennedy Space Center, Merritt Island, FL, United States. A range of microbial densities as indicated by aerobic bacterial and fungal plate counts was found depending on plant type and location. The four samples of mizuna, the only leafy green tested, were grown in different Lada root modules at different times and counts ranged from 3.1 × 103– 8.7 × 105. When compared to field grown or market produce of similar types these numbers are well within the expected range of microbial densities or even lower (Holvoet et al., 2015;Wood et al., 2015;Fröhling et al., 2018; Hummerick et al., unpublished data). The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of ISS and Veggie environmental conditions on the microbiological and nutritional quality of Veggie grown lettuce intended for crew consumption. Initiation and harvest schedule of red romaine lettuce crop in Veggie aboard ISS. Ground controls were harvested 1 day later for VEG-01 and 3 days later for VEG-03. After return to Kennedy Space Center, Merritt Island, FL, United States samples from all three experiments were maintained in a −80°C freezer until analysis. Plant samples were removed from the freezer and processed immediately while pillows were thawed at 4°C overnight. Leaf biomass was divided for microbiological and chemical analysis. The samples intended for chemical analysis were subsequently frozen at −80°C, freeze dried, then ground up using an IKA Tekmar A10 Analytical Grinding Mill. Roots were removed from each pillow and divided for microbiological and molecular analysis. Leaf and pillow root samples were placed into sterile 50 ml centrifuge tubes with sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with glass beads, weighed then shaken vigorously for 2 min. Sample extracts were diluted into PBS and appropriate dilutions were plated in duplicate onto trypticase soy agar (TSA) and inhibitory mold agar (IMA). Plates were incubated at 30°C for 48 h for TSA and 72–120 h for IMA before enumeration of colonies. Individual colony phenotypes were selected for each sample and streaked for isolation. Isolated bacterial colonies were identified using the Micro Id System (Biolog, Hayward, CA, United States) or MicroSEQ 16S rDNA sequencing kit for bacteria (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States). Fungal colonies were identified using the MicroSEQ D2 LSU rDNA kit for fungi (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States). Sequencing was completed on the ABI 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States). Bacterial and fungal DNA sequences were identified using MicroSEQ ID Software V2.0 (Bacterial Library, 2009; Fungal Library, 2011, Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies, Foster City, CA, United States) and/or NCBI Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST). Microbial DNA Isolation, 16S and ITS PCR, and Sequencing DNA was isolated from sample material processed for microbiological analysis described above. Each sample was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm to pellet microbial cells, suspended in RNAlaterand stored at −80°C until processing for DNA isolation was completed. DNA was extracted from plant leaf and root material of the Veggie pillows using the Microbial Cell DNA Isolation Kit (Qiagen, Inc, Carlsbad, CA, United States) then quantified using the Qubit 2.0 double stranded DNA assay (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, United States). The variable 4 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene (rRNA) was selected as a phylogenetic marker to identify microorganisms taxonomically to the species level. A dual indexing system for multiplexing was adapted for these communities and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was optimized for reagent concentrations and volume. Each community was labeled with two barcoded primers for identification at completion of sequencing. Amplicons were created in triplicate using 1 ng of template DNA, and final reagent concentrations of 1X buffer, 200 μM dNTP’s, 25 mM MgCl2, and 300 nM each barcoded 16S rRNA gene primer for bacterial identification or barcoded ITS primers for fungal identification (Bokulich and Mills, 2013;Kozich et al., 2013). The PCR cycling conditions were 95°C for 5 min to denature the Taq polymerase enzyme, followed by 30 cycles of 95°C for 1 min, 58°C for annealing and 72°C for 2 min for extension. A final 10 min extension of 72°C completed the PCR run on a Bio-Rad C-1000 thermocycler. After PCR all amplicons were purified using the Min-Elute System (Qiagen, Carlsbad, CA, United States) and quantified with the Qubit 2.0 high sensitivity ds DNA assay (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, United States). The purified amplicons were then pooled in an equimolar concentration to create the library following Illumina protocols. The sample library was combined with a 10% Phi-X control library to create diversity and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq using a V2 500-cycle kit (Illumina, Inc, San Diego, CA, United States). Approximately 100 mg of each dry sample powder was placed in an ASE350 cell of the Dionex Automated Solvent Extraction System (Dionex Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA, United States) and extracted with a solvent mixture of methanol:water:acetic acid (MWA) 85:14.5:0.5 (V/V/V) (methanol and acetic acid; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States). Parameters for the ASE 350 were: 100°C with 5 min static time; 70% flush; 90 s purge; 1 cycle; and 1500 psi. Extracts were analyzed immediately after extraction for total anthocyanin content by reading their absorbance at 530 and 650 nm (Beckman DU 700). A standard curve was created using Cyandin-3-Glycoside (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States). ORAC and Total Phenolic Content A separate extract was prepared for the determination, firstly, of the antioxidant capacity using the hydrophilic Oxygen Radical Adsorption Capacity (ORAC-FL) assay and secondly, the total phenolics in the sample. Twenty five milligrams (25 mg) of the freeze dried sample was placed in an ASE 350 cell and extracted with acetone:water:acetic acid (AWA) at the ratio of 70%:29.5%:0.5%. Parameters for the ASE 350 were: 80°C with 5 min static time; 60% flush; 60 s purge; 1 cycle; and 1500 psi. Aliquots of 0.2 ml were subsequently reacted with Folin-Ciocalteu phenol reagent (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States) for the determination of total phenolics by the modified Folin-Ciocalteu assay (Prior et al., 2005). A series of known concentrations of gallic acid (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States) was prepared and reacted with the same reagent to create a calibration curve that was in turn used to determine the concentration in the sample extracts. Consequently, the total phenolics were expressed as gallic acid (GA) equivalents. A diluted (1/50) AWA extract was subjected to the ORAC-FL assay as described byWu et al. (2004)andPrior et al. (2005). Specifically, dilutions of the AWA extracted samples were prepared in a 75 mM phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.0). Aliquots of 20 μL of the diluted sample were placed (in triplicate) in a 96 well transparent flat bottom microplate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States), along with appropriately diluted Trolox [(±)-6-Hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchromane- 2-carboxylic acid; Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, United States] standards (in triplicate), under subdued light. A “forward-then-reverse” pattern was used to place samples in the microplates, and edge wells were not used for standards or samples due to possible plate effects. Samples were analyzed on a BioTek Synergy Hybrid plate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT, United States) which automatically added 200 μL of diluted fluorescein (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States) into each well, followed by 20 μL of the peroxyl radical generator (AAPH [2′2′azobis (2-amidinopropane)] Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States). The assay was monitored every few minutes for 2 h, at 37°C. The ORAC-FL value was calculated from the area under the decay curve, and was reported as μmol Trolox equivalents (TE)/g dry weight. Dried and ground plant material (0.2–0.5 g) was digested in an open vessel system using a graphite-heating block (Mod Block, PN 4370-010007, CPI International). The plant material was digested at 95°C using a modification of the Environmental Protection Agency, (EPA) Method 3050B, as described below. A 5 ml aliquot of 70% nitric acid (70% Trace Metal Grade, Fisher Scientific, Suwanee, GA, United States) was added to the samples and then boiled for approximately 2 h (or until sample was completely clear). After cooling 2.5 ml of 30% hydrogen peroxide (Fisher Scientific, Suwannee, GA, United States) was applied. When the peroxide reaction ceased, samples were reheated for an additional 50 m in covered vials. Samples were cooled overnight, diluted to 50 ml with ultra-pure DI water and then passed through a 25 mm 0.45 μm syringe filter (GE Whatman, Pittsburgh, PA, United States). Samples were analyzed via Inductively Coupled Optical Emission Spectrometry. (iCAP 7000 Series, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States) A multi-element standard (Environmental Express) was diluted to the same acid concentration as the samples and quantification was done by external calibration. Data from microbiological counts (log transformed) and chemistry values were compared using a one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test using GraphPad Prism version 8.0.0 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, United States). Alpha diversity was determined using the Shannon Diversity Index and was calculated by Illumina RDP Control Software (Illumina, San Diego, CA, United States). Beta diversity of community sequencing was determined with Bray–Curtis dissimilarity (Anderson, 2001) using a one-way ANOVA (QIIME 2.0) (Bolyen et al., 2018). At-test (Microsoft Excel) was done to compare differences in the percent phyla identified.

Average Shannon Diversity Indices for three, independent Veggie experiments VEG-01A, VEG-01B, and VEG-03A, on the International Space Station and parallel ground studies. Alpha diversity in leaf tissue of the three Veggie experiments showed a significant difference between ground and flight leaf samples of VEG-03A only (P= 0.01). VEG-01A and B flight samples were not significantly different from the respective ground samples. There was also no significant difference in Beta diversity between VEG-01A, VEG-01B, and VEG-03A experiments. Bray Curtis dissimilarity calculations comparing all three experiments were not significantly different between any leaf or root samples of the three tests (P> 0.05).

Fungi are the top genera obtained from next generation sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq. Comparison of culturable and non-culturable microbes in all samples provided corroborating evidence in that all culturable microbes were identified in the sequencing data. However, sequencing data revealed many additional genera present, increasing the species diversity.

Asterisks represent statistical significance calculated from one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey-Kramer test (****P-value ≤ 0.0001). Microbiological data collected from lettuce and reported in the literature provides evidence that different parts of the plant, i.e., leaves and roots support distinct microbial communities (Ibekwe and Grieve, 2004;Toju et al., 2019). While our culture based isolation of bacteria recovered a few species unique to leaves many of the isolates present on the phyllosphere were also present in the roots. Previous work on the relationship of the phyllosphere bacterial community and airborne bacteria byVokou et al. (2012)demonstrated that colonization of the phyllosphere is not always related to the aerial microbial community within the plants proximity and may include commensal and symbiotic taxa as well as environmentally indigenous transients.Staphylococcushas been isolated on the ISS on both surfaces and in the air (Venkateswaran et al., 2014,2017) so it is not unlikely that plants in Veggie chambers would be exposed to these types of bacteria. Microbiological surveys done on a variety of surfaces and materials on the ISS reported many of the same bacteria and fungi that we isolated from plant material grown in Veggie. We compared bacterial and fungal isolates from this study of Veggie grown plants with isolates described in a study byVenkateswaran et al. (2017)which characterized the microbiology of ISS surfaces. More than 50% of the genera of bacteria and 100% of the fungi isolated and identified on ISS surfaces were also isolated from Veggie samples. Plants, regardless of growth conditions, harbor an indigenous population that may affect plant health and, if utilized as a food source, human health. One of the important findings in this study is the similarity and densities in the dominant leaf and root microbial community members as those reported in the literature grown under very different conditions (Dees et al., 2015). Lettuce leaf tissue in all three Veggie experiments was dominated withThermogemmatispora, a gram positive, sporulating, soil organism that has been known to produce secondary metabolites provided to plants as a secondary resource (Komaki et al., 2016).Thermogemmatisporahas been found in lettuce seeds in high abundance but was reduced in root and leaf tissues (unpublished data, Khodadad et al).BradyrhizobiumandMesorhizobiumare also commonly found in soils as they may participate in nitrogen fixation (Okubo et al., 2012).Bradyrhizobiumhas also been noted in higher abundance in low nutrient soils (Okubo et al., 2012). Both microbes were present in higher abundance in flight root samples and were low or undetectable in leaf tissue with the highest abundance in VEG-03A roots. VEG-03A was grown for longer periods of time and may have depleted the nutrient levels in the substrate. In addition, microbes commonly associated with water were also detected in both leaf and root tissue. These microbes mentioned previously includeRalstonia,Burkholderia, Sphingomonas, Cupriavidus, andPseudomonaswere identified in all leaf and root samples of all three Veggie experiments. These have been identified as present on ISS as well as in the ISS water system (Castro et al., 2004;Checinska et al., 2015;Venkateswaran et al., 2017). It is important to note that several of the microbes identified may be potential endosymbionts with plants or fungi and be present as epiphytic or endophytic organisms. One example isChitinophaga, found in all flight and ground root samples. Though it is unknown what the function of this bacteria may have been within these Veggie communities, it has been found to interact with fungal species present in plants by enhancing nutrient uptake and growth, altering plant water interactions or deterring potential pathogens (Shaffer et al., 2017). These interactions have the capability of shaping plant health and productivity by accessing and making additional carbon sources available (Kivlin et al., 2011;Shaffer et al., 2017). To determine their role and benefit to plants or fungi would require additional flight and ground studies. As fungi were present in each flight and ground sample community, it is important to note those in abundance and their persistence over time. Fungi have been detected on the ISS in various locations (Venkateswaran et al., 2014,2017). Leaf and root systems of VEG-01A and B were surveyed for the presence of fungi and compared.Alternaria, Microidium, andPhaeoacremoniumwere the top three fungal genera identified with sequencing.Alternaria, an Ascomycota, has been described as a saprophyte that may decompose organic matter, and increase in communities with high humidity (Patriarca, 2016). They may also associate with other fungal genera such asFusariumorStachybotrys. Though neither of these fungal genera were identified in VEG-01A, both were first detected in VEG-01B samples with higher incidence in ground samples therefore, they may have been introduced as a contaminant.Phaeoacremoniumis a plant associated endophyte previously associated with lettuce and woody plants (Mostert et al., 2005) whileMicroidiummay be an opportunistic plant pathogen especially in high humidity environments (Braun and Cook, 2012;Meeboon and Takamatsu, 2017).
