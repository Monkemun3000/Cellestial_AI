Microgravity is known to affect the organization of the cytoskeleton, cell and nuclear morphology and to elicit differential expression of genes associated with the cytoskeleton, focal adhesions and the extracellular matrix. Although the nucleus is mechanically connected to the cytoskeleton through the Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton (LINC) complex, the role of this group of proteins in these responses to microgravity has yet to be defined. In our study, we used a simulated microgravity device, a 3-D clinostat (Gravite), to investigate whether the LINC complex mediates cellular responses to the simulated microgravity environment. We show that nuclear shape and differential gene expression are both responsive to simulated microgravity in a LINC-dependent manner and that this response changes with the duration of exposure to simulated microgravity. These LINC-dependent genes likely represent elements normally regulated by the mechanical forces imposed by gravity on Earth. The nucleus is the largest organelle of the cell and homeostatic control of its shape and position are known to be crucial for cellular functions such as cell migration, cell division and the regulation of gene expression [1,2,3,4,5]. Forces generated by the cytoskeleton and external mechanical stimuli are directly transmitted to the nuclear surface through the Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton (LINC) complex [3,6,7,8,9,10,11]—a series of proteins embedded in the nuclear envelope (NE). Thus, LINC complex Nesprins on the outer nuclear membrane are connected to different cytoplasmic cytoskeletal elements and to several other force-generating motor proteins. These Nesprin family proteins also have a KASH (Klarsicht, ANC-1, Syne Homology) domain that is located in the perinuclear space and connects to the SUN (Sad1 and UNC-84) proteins of the inner nuclear membrane [12]. The SUN proteins are in turn connected to chromatin through lamins. This mechanical connection from nuclear surface to chromatin is crucial in enabling the forces from the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix (ECM) to be transmitted to both the surface and interior of the nucleus. These forces can, therefore, alter not just nuclear morphology but also internal elements such as chromatin architecture and so lead to the modulation of mechanosensitive gene expression. Exposure of cells to microgravity is known to lead to the reorganization of the cytoskeleton and the ECM. In addition, microgravity leads to morphological changes in both the cell and its nucleus, and to altered gene expression [13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20]—all features related to LINC complex function. The LINC complex is also known to be a critical factor in the normal formation and development of tissues, such as the breast cell acinus [21]. Simulated microgravity (SMG) achieved by clinorotation disrupts features such as cell proliferation, cell adhesion, cell cycle progression and cytokine production [13,22]. These are all LINC-regulated processes, and failure in their normal functioning has been linked to aberrant developmental regulation, such as cancer. Indeed, in addition to altering all these LINC-dependent features, SMG also suppresses tumor cell growth and development in e.g., breast epithelial cell cultures [23]. However, despite such circumstantial evidence, the role of the LINC complex in cellular responses to altered gravitational environments has yet to be studied. Therefore, we have asked how the LINC complex affects changes in nuclear shape and differential gene expression in SMG. We report that the nucleus requires an intact LINC complex for its shape to be modulated by altered gravity conditions. We also identify LINC-dependent genes associated with this response, indicating that elements of the genome regulation normally seen in altered gravity requires an intact LINC complex. 2.1. Simulated Microgravity Elicits Changes in Nuclear Shape that Depend on the LINC Complex As noted above, breast epithelial cells have been previously shown to exhibit responses to SMG, suggesting that they might be a useful model to study the involvement of the LINC complex in SMG-related effects. Furthermore, we have a deep understanding of nuclear shaping under normal gravity conditions in MCF 10A—a non-tumerogenic human mammary epithelial cell line [24]. This cell line was engineered to express a construct that interferes with LINC complex function (see below), making it well-suited to investigating the role of the LINC complex in SMG-related effects. Therefore, we chose MCF 10A cells, wildtype and engineered, to study how SMG may impact nuclear events, using a 3-D clinostat to simulate microgravity. The doxycycline-induced cells were, therefore, exposed to 3-D clinorotation for 20 h. The 1G (ground) controls (i.e., identically doxycycline treated cells but not on the clinostat) were placed next to the clinostat in the same incubator. After treatment, the cells were fixed and the 3-dimensional nuclear morphology was monitored using confocal microscopy as described earlier. Nuclear shape response to simulated microgravity (SMG) depends on the LINC complex. (A) Confocal images show the nuclei (blue) and actin (red) staining (to reveal the cell morphology) of fixed GFP-KDEL (GFP) and SUN1L-KDEL (SUN1L) cells after 20 h in 1G and SMG. Top row shows the x-z view and the bottom rows show the x-y view of the corresponding nuclei and cells. Similarly, (B) shows confocal images of the nuclei and actin of fixed GFP-KDEL and SUN1L-KDEL cells in 1G and SMG condition for 2 h. Scale bars are 10 µm. Images are representative of the mean values. Nuclear morphology: After 20 h exposure to SMG, the nuclear height decreased in GFP-KDEL cells, while the height increased in SUN1L-KDEL cells again indicating a role of the LINC complex in the response of the nuclear shape to SMG. *p< 0.05, comparing same cell line to the 1G condition within the same time-point, statistically significantly different; the comparisons are with the corresponding 1G control. All values are shown as the mean ± SD.2.2. Short Duration Simulated Microgravity-Induced, LINC-Dependent Changes in Nuclear Shape. 2.2. LINC-Dependent Differential Gene Expression in Simulated Microgravity KEGG pathway analysis of differentially expressing genes in SMG vs. 1G after 2 and 20 h. (A) Pathways enriched with up-regulated and down-regulated genes in GFP-KDEL cells (left) and SUN1L-KDEL cells (right) after 2h exposure to SMG. (B) Up- and down-regulated enriched pathways in GFP-KDEL cells (left) and SUN1L-KDEL cells (right) after 20 h in SMG. (C) LINC-dependent up- and down-regulated enriched pathways in SMG after 2 (left) and 20 h (right). 2.3. LINC Dependency of SMG-Induced Changes in Gene Expression Is Also Determined by the Duration of Exposure to SMG Network of top 20 clusters of the enriched terms. (A) Network representing each cluster by a different color; (B) network enrichment shown with pie chart. The size of the pie in each node depends on the gene count of the two conditions. Red indicates enrichment of pathways due to LINC-dependent genes at 20 h of SMG, and blue indicates enrichment of pathways in LINC-dependent genes at 2 h of SMG. (C) Enriched terms in Clusters 1 and 2 are all linked to mitochondria. A highly reproducible suite of effects were observed in cells exposed to altered gravity relating to the reorganization of their cytoskeleton and cell adhesion proteins [31], coupled with changes in the morphologies of the cells, including their nuclei. There is a close link between nuclear shape and the cytoskeleton, with various cytoskeletal elements playing roles in regulating nuclear shape and position. Thus, actin polymerization flattens the nucleus and repositions it by pulling on it. Additionally, forces generated by microtubule motor proteins such as dynein and kinesin, and acto-myosin contractile and tensile forces are also transmitted to the nuclear surface. Intermediate filaments also form a cage-like structure around the nucleus giving it structural stability. Each of these elements are mechanically connected to the nucleus through LINC complex proteins. The mechanical integration afforded by these connections through the LINC complex plays a critical role in transferring mechanical signals from the ECM and the forces generated within the cytoplasm to the nucleus [32]. These signals regulate features such as nuclear shape, homeostatic position and rotation—all important elements for nuclear functioning. Therefore, not surprisingly, the LINC complex is important for an array of normal cellular functions such as migration, division, proliferation, differentiation and wound healing [33]. Consistent with these ideas of a central role of the LINC complex in mechanical signaling, there are also major LINC-associated diseases such as nuclear envelopathies, laminopathy, skeletal muscular dystrophy and cardiomyopathy. Abnormal regulation of LINC complex genes SUN1, SUN2 and nesprin 2 is also seen in breast cancer. Several LINC-associated proteins such as SUN1, SUN2, Emerins and Nesprin-3 were seen to be differentially regulated in cancer cells exposed to simulated microgravity [13]. Indeed, SMG promotes breast cancer cell proliferation, invasion and adhesion, nuclear positioning, as well as cell cycle progression, apoptosis [22] and abnormal expression of cancer inducing cytokines [14]. The LINC complex is known to play a very important role in the normal formation and development of breast cell acinus and in regulating the shape of the cell and the nucleus in both the breast cell culture of single cells and of monolayers [24]. Thus, understanding how SMG affects these cellular processes holds potential for both understanding how gravitational forces might be playing roles in normal tissue development on Earth and in revealing potential practical issues and risks related to long duration spaceflight. We also looked at the role of the LINC complex in differential gene expression in response to SMG, revealing that there are LINC-dependent genes that are up- and down-regulated in response to SMG. We hypothesize that the nuclear shape regulation and gene expression dependency on the LINC complex are inter-related. Thus, gene activity depends on the location of the chromosome and its packing inside the nucleus [38], e.g., chromosome territories are positioned differently and have different interactions in breast epithelial cells (MCF 10A) compared to corresponding malignant cells (MCF 10CA1a), supporting different patterns of gene expression [39]. Nuclear shape and rigidity depends on the packing of the heterochromatin [40] and changes in nuclear shape may in turn feedback to change the level of chromatin condensation [41]. Therefore, it is highly likely that patterns of gene expression depend to some degree on nuclear shape [4,42]. The LINC complex connects the cytoskeleton to the nuclear surface; the SUN proteins in the inner nuclear envelope are connected to lamins, which are connected to chromatin. Thus, the LINC complex provides a strong candidate for linking cellular level mechanical forces to changes in nuclear gene expression. For example, interfering with the LINC complex in plant cells led to decondensation of chromocenters and silencing of transcription [43]. Hence, the LINC complex may impact gene expression in two ways: (1) by directly affecting chromatin compaction; (2) by regulating the shape of the nucleus, and both mechanisms may be in play once cells move from the 1G to a microgravity environment. Cancer is a leading cause of death around the world and with an ever-increasing range and duration of deep space exploration missions, astronauts are at a potentially elevated risk of developing this disease. For decades, cells have been studied in altered gravity environments using various platforms such as the International Space Station, sounding rockets, parabolic flights and microgravity simulators. Common cell functions such as proliferation, migration, division and differentiation are all affected differently in altered gravity environments [13,36,54,55]. Genes associated with the progression of cancer by metastasis (cytokines) are also differentially regulated in microgravity as are several other genes related to wound healing, focal adhesion [13], and growth factors. However, our analysis suggests a complex pattern of gene expression responses in microgravity in relation to the LINC complex. We discovered genes that are LINC-dependent in SMG that are associated with different types of cancer. For example, we found the gene RBMS3 to be significantly upregulated in a LINC-dependent manner in response to 2 h of SMG. This gene acts in a defense mechanism against breast and other types of cancer, and upregulation of this gene can suppress cancer or tumor progression [56]. Overexpression of the SRA1 gene is also associated with breast, ovarian, prostate, lung and liver cancer [57]. In our study, we found that SRA1 gene expression is sensitive to SMG. However, although the LINC-dependent SMG responsiveness of, e.g., RBMS3 remained at 20 h of SMG, it was lost for the SRA1 gene. These observations suggest an interplay of signaling and time in the LINC mediated modulation of these genes in response to SMG, and to potential effects on cancer development. Human breast epithelial cells (MCF 10A from ATCC), MCF 10A SS-GFP-KDEL and MCF 10A SS-GFP-SUN1L-KDEL cells (created by Dr. Tanmay Lele and Dr. Kyle Roux [21,25]) were a kind gift to us. The inducible cell lines were created with MCF 10A TET-ON (Clontech) transduced retrovirally with pRetroX-Tight.puro containing either SS-HA-GFP-SUN1L-KDEL for LINC disruption or SS-HA-GFP-KDEL for controls [25]. To create a stable line, cell selection was performed with 0.5 μg/mL puromycin and then screened by immunofluorescence postinduction with or without 1 μg/mL doxycycline for 18 h. The cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 (Thermofisher, Grand Island, NY, USA) without phenol red, supplemented with 5% (w/v) horse serum, cholera toxin (Sigma, Saint Louis, MO USA), epidermal growth factor (Peprotech, Cranbury, NJ, USA), hydrocortisone (Sigma), insulin (Sigma) and penicillin streptomycin (Thermofisher, Grand Island, NY, USA). The cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified, 5% (v/v) CO2incubating chamber. The inducible cells were trypsinized and seeded in fibronectin coated chamber flasks with 30% confluency and cultured for 24 h. To induce SUN1L-KDEL for LINC disruption and GFP-KDEL for control comparison, the media were supplemented with 1 µg/mL doxycycline [21]. These cells were cultured in doxycycline for 24 h before placing them on the 3-D clinostat. 4.2. Simulated Microgravity Using 3-D Clinostat The chamber flasks were filled completely with media containing 1 µg/mL doxycycline (Fisher) and care taken to remove all the bubbles that may cause shear stress to the cell monolayer. The chamber flask was sealed with a rubber stopper, and a syringe was used to release any excess pressure. The 3-D clinostat (Gravite, Space Bio Laboratories Ltd., Hiroshima, Japan) consisting of two perpendicular rotating axes was run in Mode C preprogrammed with an inbuilt computer and gravity acceleration sensor to measure simulate microgravity (to the order of 10−3G) by rotating the inner and outer frame simultaneously at a constant angular velocity (~2 rotations per minute) [58,59,60]. Four cell culture flasks on slides (Thermofisher, Grand Island, NY, USA, 170920) were mounted at the center and were placed in a controlled environment maintaining the temperature at 37 °C for 2 and 20 h. The 1G control samples were placed in the same incubator. All the experiments were conducted twice, and each experiment had two sets of samples in both 1G and SMG conditions. A Student’st-test was applied for statistical comparison for nuclear morphology. 4.3. Immunostaining and Microscopy After the cells were exposed to simulated microgravity for fixed periods of time, they were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and then washed with PBS. To stain for F-actin, 1:50 Alex Fluor 594 phalloidin was used and for the nucleus, 1:250 Hoechst 33,342 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used. Cells were then incubated for 20 min at room temperature before washing with PBS. The cells were then imaged with the 60×/1.40 NA oil immersion objective of a Nikon A1R laser scanning inverted confocal microscope (Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY, USA). To immunostain for the Nesprin-2 protein, we followed the protocol of Zhang et al. [21] and used the primary antibody anti-Nesprin-2 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA, ab204308) at a 1:100 dilution and the secondary antibody goat anti-rabbit IgG (Thermofisher, Grand Island, NY, USA, A-11037) at a 1:200 dilution. Z-stack images were acquired for the cells with 0.3 µM height intervals. The images were reconstructed using the Nikon NIS elements software, and maximum intensity profiles for the nucleus were created for the x-z view. The full width half maximum (FWHM) technique in MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) was used to acquire the nuclear height measurement. The maximum intensity projection of the x-y view of the nucleus was used to measure the nuclear area using the ImageJ software. 4.4. RNA seq Library Preparation, Sequencing and Data Analysis Approximately 2 × 106cells were frozen in 700 µL of QIAzol buffer (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The samples were immediately vortexed and placed on ice before storing at −80 °C. Once all samples were collected, they were randomized, and total RNA was extracted and purified using the Qiagen RNeasy Micro Kit, following recommended procedures, with on-column DNase treatment. Libraries were prepared from purified RNA (0.3 ng) using the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Globin (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Three runs of 75 bp paired-end sequencing were performed on pooled libraries using the Illumina NextSeq 550 System. Quality control of purified RNA and RNA libraries was carried out using the Fragment Analyzer System (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). This work was supported by the NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) administered by Universities Space Research Association (USRA) and the NASA Space Biology Program. We also extend our sincere appreciation to Tanmay Lele, University of Florida, for the kind gift of the MCF 10A engineered cells.
