A number of diseases, including osteoporosis (Bouxsein, 2003a;Saito and Marumo, 2010) and type II diabetes (Janghorbani et al., 2007;Vestergaard, 2007;Farr and Khosla, 2016;Rubin and Patsch, 2016), are thought to increase fracture risk due in part to deteriorated bone quality. That is, these diseases may result in detrimental changes to mechanical behavior that are not directly associated with reductions in bone mass (Hernandez and Keaveny, 2006). Concerns over possible changes in bone quality have also caused the FDA to require extensive pre-clinical animal testing on any new treatments (Mosekilde, 1995;Ominsky et al., 2011). In assessing bone quality, various mechanical properties can be measured (Hernandez and Keaveny, 2006;Turner and Burr, 1993;Fyhrie and Christiansen, 2015), typically stiffness, strength, toughness, and ductility. All these properties are obtained from monotonic loading. In addition, the response of bone to cyclic (repetitive) loading may be important for bone quality assessment if such loading produces unique failure mechanisms (e.g. slow crack growth, microdamage accumulation) that are not manifested in monotonic loading (Kruzic and Ritchie, 2008;Nalla et al., 2003). Biomechanical testing of any type is challenging to perform in a precise manner in small animals, such as in rats and mice, due to the small size of the bones and the inevitable machine-compliance effects that are difficult to eliminate. Furthermore, for cyclic loading, loss of test specimens during the experiment and the substantial variation in cyclic-loading responses both serve to reduce statistical power (Brouwers et al., 2009), which in turn can lead to inconclusive findings regarding the role of bone quality. As a result of these challenges, and because of the continuing interest in bone quality (Bouxsein, 2003b;Seeman and Delmas, 2006), there remains a need to refine the experimental protocols for biomechanical testing of small-animal bone specimens, particularly for cyclic loading. Here, we report on a method for cyclic biomechanical testing of the mouse lumbar vertebra ex vivo that has improved precision. This technique should help optimize statistical power in animal experiments, thus improving the ability of researchers to detect mechanically relevant changes in bone quality due to aging, disease, or treatment, particularly for any situation in which samples sizes are limited in number. Our experiments used L5 vertebrae obtained post-mortem from male C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Labs, Sacramento, CA) that were in the control groups of various previous studies (unpublished). All original studies, and this study, were approved by NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) Animal Care & Use Committee, and all experimental testing was conducted at NASA ARC. Ages of the mice ranged from 15 to 18 weeks. After sacrifice, the L1-S1 spinal segment was excised from the mouse with a scalpel via an anterior approach. The L5 vertebra was then separated by slicing through the adjacent intervertebral discs, gently cleaned of soft tissue, wrapped in saline-soaked gauze (Gibco PBS 1X, pH 7.4), and stored at −20 °C until specimen preparation. Obtaining true plano-parallel surfaces, which is difficult for such small specimens (Brouwers et al., 2009), is important to ensure full contact — and thus uniform compression — between the specimen surface and loading platens. If plano-parallel surfaces are not achieved, or if the loading platens are not perfectly parallel, local contact can occur over just part of the specimen surface. This introduces unwanted scatter in the mechanical response and perhaps also premature failure. Thus, we developed a detailed method for this aspect of the specimen preparation (Fig. 1). Each vertebra was aligned inside a 3D-printed (Stratasys Dimension SST 1200es, Eden Prairie, MN), disposable jig with a metal pin (diameter range 0.91 to 0.99 mm; length of 38 mm) (Fig. 1A) and secured with polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). The combined jig-bone construct was then positioned in a diamond-saw microtome (Leica SP1600 Saw Microtome, Wetzlar, Germany). Two parallel cuts were made on the cranial and caudal surfaces under constant irrigation to remove only the endplates (Fig. 1B), preserving the maximum amount of bone tissue. A final cut through the posterior pedicles released the vertebral body from the jig (Fig. 1C). 2.3. Quantitative micro-CT imaging After machining, specimens were imaged using quantitative micro-CT (μCT 50, Scanco Medical AG, Bruttisellen, Switzerland) at a 10-μm voxel size (55 kV, 109 μA, 1000 projections per 180°, 500 ms integration time) (Fig. 2). Specimens were returned to the freezer after imaging. The micro-CT images of the whole specimen (cortical and trabecular compartments) were then analyzed for height, minimum tissue cross-sectional area (minimum value of tissue area at any cross-section, over all cross-sections), and total bone volume fraction (BV/TV) (ImageJ 1.51h, Java 1.6.0). Each specimen with cortices removed was then evaluated for trabecular micro-architecture (Scanco Evaluation Software v6.0): trabecular bone volume fraction (Tb.BV/TV), number (Tb.N), thickness (Tb.Th), and separation (Tb.Sp).

Calculating specimen-specific cyclic forces We used a force-control loading protocol, which allows both creep and damage to occur during cyclic loading. However, since the cyclic loading response of bone appears to be determined by the magnitude of the appliedstrain(as opposed to the magnitude of stress) (Nalla et al., 2003;Keaveny et al., 1994a;Keaveny et al., 1994b), our protocol required us to calculate a specimen-specific level of applied force that would result in the same level of initial apparent strain (calculated over the entire specimen) for all specimens. Cyclic loading in force control in this way should minimize scatter in the resulting fatigue life despite the heterogeneity in size, shape, and microarchitecture of the mouse vertebrae. This protocol required measuring the overall vertebral stiffness before starting the cyclic loading so that the prescribed apparent strains (εminand εmax) could be converted into specimen-specific levels of applied force (Fminand Fmax). However, experimentally measuring stiffness for any bone is challenging due to different types of machine compliance errors, which can introduce both fixed and random errors (Odgaard et al., 1989;Odgaard and Linde, 1991;Keaveny et al., 1993;Keaveny et al., 1997). The fixed errors have implications for external validity, but otherwise do not compromise comparisons within any given experiment and are therefore oftentimes acceptable. However, large random errors compromise statistical power, particularly when sample sizes are <10 per group. Thus, to circumvent any errors associated with machine compliance, we used a computationally derived stiffness (KFEA) that was obtained from specimen-specific, micro-CT-based, linearly elastic, voxel-based finite element analysis. The models used 10-μm sized cube voxels, and assumed a nominal value of 10 GPa for the tissue-level (voxel) elastic modulus for all specimens (seeAppendix Afor details). The specimen-specific cyclic forces (Fmin; Eq.1and Fmax; Eq.2) were then calculated for each specimen using KFEA, the specimen height (H) as measured from micro-CT, and two assumed nominal values of initial apparent elastic strain (εmin= 0.05% and εmax= 0.5%): The assumed value of εmax= 0.5% was chosen empirically by trial and error based on earlier preliminary experiments on 6 mouse vertebral specimens. There, we found that the resulting Fmaxvalue was approximately half of the directly measured ultimate force, which generally placed a specimen in the middle region of its fatigue life. The minimum initial elastic apparent strain value was chosen such that the resulting Fminvalues were near 1 N. Within one week after imaging, specimens were thawed again to room temperature and prepared for cyclic loading in uniaxial compression to failure. The vertebral body was positioned onto the center of the lower platen of the material testing device (TA ElectroForce 3200, Eden Prairie, MN). Because obtaining perfectly parallel loading platens can be challenging, the upper platen comprised a spherically-seated platen on a lubricated ball-bearing which allows the platen surface to rotate and mate flush with the sample surface to achieve uniform contact (Fig. 3); with the pre-load in place, the set screws on the upper platen are locked. We used a compressive pre-load of 1 N, and after the platen was locked room-temperature saline-solution (Gibco PBS 1X, pH 7.4) was added to the bath until the specimen was fully submerged. The pre-load was then adjusted to the predetermined Fmin, and then sinusoidal cycles of compression between Fminand Fmaxwere applied at a frequency of 8 Hz until the specimen reached 10% strain, measured via the actuation of the testing device platens. Experimental test set-up for fatigue test shown with spherically-seated upper platen and specimen after preparation. Three plots were produced from each specimen fatigue test to define outcome measurements. First, the force-displacement data were plotted for each loading-unloading cycle, from which stiffness was defined as the secant stiffness, or range of force divided by range of displacement per cycle (Fig. 4A). Second, the apparent strain per cycle was plotted, and was separated into three curves representing total strain, creep strain, and damage strain (Fig. 4B). The total-strain curve was used to find the number of cycles to failure, or fatigue life (Nf) and strain to failure (εf) using the point of intersection between the curve and a 0.5% line offset parallel to a line of best fit for the secondary region (Brouwers et al., 2009;Bowman et al., 1998). Third, we plotted stiffness per cycle (Fig. 4C) to identify three variables: elastic stiffness of the specimen (Kelastic), stiffness at failure (Kf), and rate of stiffness degradation. Elastic stiffness was calculated as the average stiffness over ±500 cycles centered about the maximum value of stiffness (Kmax), which typically occurred after a few thousand cycles of loading; the stiffness at failure was defined as the stiffness measured at cycle Nf; and the rate of stiffness degradation (ΔK/ΔN) was calculated as the slope of a line that best fit the middle 50% of points in the range between Kmaxand Kf. The ΔK/ΔN parameter reflected accumulation of fatigue damage, larger values indicating a more rapid accumulation of fatigue damage per loading cycle. In addition to these fatigue parameters, we also calculated an effective elastic tissue modulus (Etissue, in GPa, Eq.3). This was calculated using both the experimental (Kelastic) and computational (KFEA) assessments of stiffness, scaling with respect to the assumed nominal value of the tissue-level modulus of 10 GPa in the finite element analysis: The new method also provided other measurements related to bone quality, both of which displayed high uniformity across the specimens: the effective tissue elastic modulus, Etissue, was 5.83 ± 0.22 GPa and the strain to (cyclic) failure, εf, was 3.20 ± 0.80%. The main application of our new method is to provide greater statistical power in using small-animal experiments to mechanically assess relevant aspects of bone quality associated with aging, disease, or treatment. A small sample size and scatter associated with the fatigue testing present challenges for detecting statistically significant effects unless those effects are large. For example, Brouwers et al. (Brouwers et al., 2009) found a 37.5% difference in steady-state creep rate and 15.7% difference in loss of stiffness with zoledronate treatment in an osteoporotic rat model, but could not report a detectable significance due to high variation in the data and loss of some samples. Our KEXPmethod was similar to their method, which produced standard deviations in fatigue life (reported as “time-to-failure”) up to the same magnitude as the mean value. Our new method should reduce that range up to 8-fold. Furthermore, unlike in the Brouwers literature protocol, we had no loss of specimens, enabled by repeatable specimen preparation (e.g. 3D-printed support jigs for machining plano-parallel surfaces) and uniform loading of specimen surfaces (e.g. spherically-seated platen), which further improves statistical power, and can be implemented for monotonic testing or fatigue testing of small-animal vertebrae. That said, our new method is a time intensive process for specimen preparation, micro-CT, image processing, and finite element analysis. However, the extra effort improves the ability to detect small differences across treatment groups without using a large number of animals, which is advantageous both ethically and also logistically when sample sizes are inherently limited (e.g. space flight experiments). Thus, use of our new method may improve the ability of future studies to elucidate mechanically relevant aspects of bone quality associated with aging, disease, or treatment.

Image processing of the original micro-CT images was conducted prior to finite element analysis for each specimen. First, the image stack was reoriented to align the specimen with the z-axis (DataViewer v1.5.2.4, Bruker). Second, the reoriented images were thresholded using the ‘Default’ Autothreshold algorithm in ImageJ (ImageJ 1.51h, Java 1.6.0_24). The final stack was used to build the finite element model. To determine the computational stiffness, high-resolution linear finite element analysis was performed. Each 10-μm cubic voxel in the images was converted into an eight-noded brick element to create a finite element model of the entire vertebral body. All bone elements were assigned the same elastic, homogeneous and isotropic material properties: elastic modulus 10 GPa and Poisson's ratio of 0.3. These values are based on experimental testing of core samples of trabecular bone from human vertebrae (Bevill and Keaveny, 2009). A varied modulus based on tissue mineral density and thus micro-CT greyscale was not used in this methodology due to underestimation of apparent modulus using this approach (Kaynia et al., 2015). Each model was uniaxially compressed to 2% apparent strain, the input was displacement which varied depending on specimen height. Typical models contained approximately 1.5 million elements and were solved using a highly scalable, implicit parallel finite-element framework Olympus (Adams et al., 2004) running on a Dell Linux Cluster supercomputer (Stampede, Texas Advanced Computing Center). The outcome was the whole-bone reaction force, which was then used to calculate computational stiffness, KFEA(Eq.4), by dividing by the input displacement. Structural parameters and resulting forces and fatigue life for L4 and L5 vertebrae used in testing the “FMAXmethod”. Max Stress is calculated from the resulting maximum force found from monotonic testing of the L4 (i.e. σ = FL4/AL4). This maximum stress is a material property and assumed to be the same for the adjacent L5 bone. The cyclic loading force applied to the L5 was derived from this stress (i.e. Fapplied= 0.5(σ)(AL5)), labeled “50% of L5 Max Force” in the table. The range in applied force calculated led to a larger standard deviation in fatigue life when compared to the new method KFEA.",
