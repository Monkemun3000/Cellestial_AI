Among the many stressors astronauts are exposed to during spaceflight, cosmic radiation may lead to various serious health effects. Specifically, space radiation may contribute to decreased immunity, which has been documented in astronauts during short- and long-duration missions, as evidenced by several changes in cellular immunity and plasma cytokine levels. Reactivation of latent herpes viruses, either directly from radiation of latently infected cells and/or from perturbation of the immune system, may result in disease in astronauts. Epstein‒Barr virus (EBV) is one of the eight human herpes viruses known to infect more than 90% of human adults and persists for the life of the host without normally causing adverse effects. Reactivation of several latent viruses in astronauts is well documented, although the mechanism of reactivation is not well understood. We studied the effect of four different types of radiation, (1)137Cs gamma rays, (2) 150-MeV protons, (3) 600 MeV/n carbon ions, and (4) 600 MeV/n iron ions on the activation of lytic gene transcription and of reactivation of EBV in a latently infected cell line (Akata) at doses of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy. The data showed that for all doses used in this study, lytic gene transcription was induced and median viral loads were significantly higher for all types of radiation than in corresponding control samples, with the increases detected as early as four days post-exposure and generally tapering off at later time points. The viability and size of EBV-infected Akata cells were highly variable and exhibited approximately the same trend in time for all radiation types at 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy. This work shows that reactivation of viruses can occur due to the effect of different types of radiation on latently infected cells in the absence of changes or cytokines produced in the immune system. In general, gamma rays are more effective than protons, carbon ions, and iron ions in inducing latent virus reactivation, though these high-energy particles did induce more sustained and later reactivation of EBV lytic gene transcription. These findings also challenge the common relative biological effectiveness concept that is often used in radiobiology for other end points. 1.1. Stressors in a Space Environment 1.2. Reactivation of Latent Viruses We have studied the effects of four types of radiation,137Cs gamma, 150-MeV protons, 600 MeV/n carbon ions, and 600 MeV/n iron ions on the reactivation of EBV in an EBV-producer line (Akata) in vitro. This cell line was established from a Japanese patient with Burkitt’s lymphoma [12]. There are several reasons for the choice of radiation types. The137Cs gamma ray is a common source of photons, which are often used in experiments as a reference for low linear energy transfer (LET). Protons are an obvious choice as they are the most important component of the galactic cosmic ray (GCR) spectra. The 150-MeV protons have a low LET and are considered to have a relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of 1.1 for several biological end points [13]. The RBE value of 1.1 for protons is based mostly on cell colony formation data, generally at higher, therapy-type dosages. Although it does not necessarily apply to other biological end points, it is an indication that protons and photons have similar biological effects at the same dose. The carbon ions are present in GCR and are also considered for hadron therapy. The iron ions are a relatively rare occurrence in the GCR, but they have high LET and high RBE for several biological end points [13]. Therefore, by using these ions, which cover a large part of the GCR spectra, the biological effects of representative particle types in space can be determined. In this study, we found that a significant increase in EBV reactivation relative to controls is observed for all radiation types used. However, when equal doses (physical doses not corrected for the RBE) are compared with control, each radiation source induced viral reactivation differently. In general, gamma rays are more effective than protons, carbon ions, and iron ions in inducing latent virus reactivation. These findings challenge the common RBE concept that is often used in radiobiology for other end points [13]. This difference in viral reactivation may be explained by the differences in the radiation track structure. Effects of gamma radiation on Akata cells. Cells were radiated with 0.1 Gy (orange), 0.5 Gy (grey), 1 Gy (yellow) or 2 Gy (dark blue), then incubated for 16 days. The control flask (light blue) was not irradiated.

Simulation of Irradiated Volume Simulation of the irradiation of a volume by137Cs photons, 150-MeV protons, 600 MeV/n carbon ions, and 600 MeV/n iron ions. In all cases, the dosage to the irradiated volume is ~0.5 Gy. We studied the effect of four different types of radiation (137Cs gamma rays, 150-MeV protons, 600 MeV/n carbon ions, and 600 MeV/n iron ions) on induction of lytic gene transcription and reactivation of EBV in a latently infected cell line, their cell size and viability at doses of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy. The doses are physical doses. RBE of 1.1 for protons is referred to other biological endpoints, such as chromosome aberrations or survival, but not for the endpoint of virus activation. The changes in viral load are presented without any corrections. However, by looking at the graphs of the viral reactivation data, a correction by a factor of 1.1 on either the dosage or change in viral load would clearly be insufficient to explain the difference between the protons and gammas. The greatest differences were found on day 4 for all four types of radiation at all doses studied. This effect then decreased over the subsequent time points (days 8, 12, 16, and 20) except for 2 Gy dose where viral load levels were approximately maintained up to day 8. Gamma radiation generally produced the highest rates of viral reactivation when compared to controls followed by protons, carbon ions, and iron ions at all the doses and at all the time points. When the initiation of viral transcription was examined, a prerequisite for EBV DNA replication and reactivation, some interesting trends emerged. Gamma irradiation induced transcription of both the immediate early and late genes, peaking at day 4. In contrast, the high energy particles, while also inducing transcription initially at day 4, in many instances resulted in a second peak of transcription at later times (day 14 and 18). While the mechanism of this second round of transcription is not clear, it could be speculated that it is the result of secondary effects of the initial radiation exposure on the cell, which is translated to the viral genome again at a later time point. However, there is good correspondence between the initial increase in EBV lytic gene transcription at day 4 with increases in EBV genome load. It should be noted though, that initiation of immediate early (IE) gene transcription of the herpesviruses (in this case BZLF1 of EBV) does not necessarily represent progression to reactivation. There are many examples of initiation of IE gene activation that are abortive and do not proceed to productive reactivation. It is for this reason that we also examined a late gene (BLLF1) as well as analyzed changes in amounts of EBV genomes in order to determine whether initial transcriptional activation of an IE gene, followed by a late gene resulted in an increase in EBV genomes, likely reflecting productive reactivation. Considering this, we present strong evidence that all forms of radiation examined both resulted in initiation of E and L gene transcription and in increase in viral genomes at four days post-treatment. Therefore, we feel confident that this reflects productive reactivation at this time point. In contrast, the transcriptional events that we detected at later time points (day 12) did not coincide with a statistically significant increase in viral genomes. Therefore it is unclear whether this transcription reflected abortive reactivation, or if productive reactivation occurred, this happening in only a small number of cells that we were not able to detect. Further studies will be required to determine the mechanism and biological consequences of this second late peak in transcription. Because we were an exploratory study, it was necessary to use the conservative approach of controlling the false discovery rate to 1% in reporting significant effects. For this reason, differences that appear beyond chance variation when taken in isolation were not reported as being significant here. On the other hand, we feel confident that those effects we did flag as significant have an excellent chance of being reproducible. When travelling to Mars, it is estimated that every cell nucleus in an astronaut’s body would be hit by a proton or secondary electron (e.g., electrons of the target atoms ionized by the HZE ion) every few days and by an HZE ion about once a month [3]. Therefore, space radiation is expected to be a very important stressor for astronauts, which may have direct effects on the reactivation of latent viruses that are likely exacerbated by the state of decreased immunity. During spaceflight the immune system is altered, e.g., decreased cellular immunity has been observed in Space Shuttle astronauts after only a few days in orbit [14]. Furthermore, recent studies have shown dysregulation of T-cell function and cytokine production profiles during long-duration spaceflight aboard the International Space Station [15,16]. In this in vitro experiment the immune system was not present thereby providing strong evidence that radiation of latently infected cells alone is likely a major contributor to the reactivation of herpes viruses observed in astronauts. Space radiation is composed of a large number of different types of ions with various energies. There is also the possibility of nontargeted effects in an irradiated tissue. Because the role of ionizing radiation on virus reactivation is not well understood, more research is needed to understand the mechanisms of radiation-induced virus reactivation and the effects of dose, dose-rate, ion types, and energies. Another interesting result of our studies is that radiation-induced viral reactivation occurs within days whereas radiation carcinogenesis usually takes months or years to develop. Understanding the molecular events involved in viral reactivation will provide important new insights to radiation-induced human diseases associated with EBV. Our study has also shown that virus reactivation may be an adverse consequence of radiation exposure not necessarily related to spaceflight radiation, but also to other sources such as radiotherapy treatment. The radiation exposure could lead to reactivation of viruses other than EBV, such as VZV resulting in shingles. For example, a recent study has shown that, compared with incidence rates of shingles reported in a general U.S. population, the age- and sex-standardized rates of shingles were 4.8 times higher (95% confidence interval (CI), 4.0–5.6) in patients with hematologic malignancies and 1.9 times higher (95% CI, 1.7–2.1) in those with solid tumors (23). It is not clear, however, whether radiotherapy directly reactivates virus in latently infected cells or simply suppresses the immune system to allow viral reactivation to proceed. Thus, a better understanding of radiation-induced reactivation of EBV and other herpes viruses should provide important knowledge for spaceflight as well as terrestrial medicine. In conclusion, four types of radiation (137Cs gamma rays, 150-MeV protons, 600 MeV/n carbon ions, and 600 MeV/n iron ions) induced EBV lytic gene transcription and reactivation of EBV in a latently infected cell line at doses of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy. This was observed in the absence of any cytokine production or involvement of the immune system. Our finding that gamma rays are more effective than protons, carbon ions, and iron ions in inducing latent virus reactivation challenges the RBE value of 1.1, which is used for protons, and also shows that RBE may be smaller than 1 for carbon ions and iron ions. An Epstein‒Barr virus (EBV) producer line, designated Akata (ATCC), was established from a Japanese patient with Burkitt’s lymphoma and used in this study [12]. Akata cells have a t(8q−; 14q+) chromosomal translocation—typical of Burkitt’s lymphoma cells. These cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 Medium (Gibco®, Carlsbad, CA, USA) with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) (ATCC®30-2020™, ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA), 25 U/mL penicillin, 25 µg/mL Streptomycin, and 2 mM L-Glutamine (Gibco®, Carlsbad, CA, USA) [17]. Cultures were incubated at 37 °C with 95% humidity and 5% carbon dioxide. Dosage rate (cGy/min) for different radiation types. Cells were aseptically split and harvested from each flask by removing 25 mL of cells and media on day 0, and then on every fourth day for 20 days. In each of the experiments, the first harvest (day 0) was made before irradiation, while all other samples were harvested post-irradiation. The control samples were not irradiated. Except for day 20 (the last day), harvested cells and media were replaced with 25 mL of fresh RPMI 1640 Medium. After each harvest, live cells were split into five aliquots of 1 × 106cells/mL and then frozen for later assessment of cell size, cell viability, detection of EBV lytic RNA transcripts, and EBV viral load. All measurements were conducted in quadruplicates. Proton, carbon, and iron irradiation experiments were performed at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory at the Brookhaven National Laboratory’s facilities in New York.137Cesium gamma irradiation was performed at both the NASA Johnson Space Center and the Brookhaven National Laboratory. The energy of protons was 150 MeV/n, of carbon ions was 600 MeV/n, and of iron ions was 600 MeV/n. 4.3. Cell Counts and Viability Cell count, concentration, diameter, and percentage viability of the fresh cells were measured before freezing (Cellometer Auto 2000, Nexcelom, Lawrence, MA, USA) in 1 million EBV-positive Akata cells in each condition. Cellometer Auto 2000 gives a clear distribution of live and dead cells when counted. Only live cell counts were accounted for when splitting the cells. 4.4. Analysis of EBV Lytic Gene Transcription Irradiated and control samples were harvested into RNALater™ (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA) and stored at −80 °C until extraction. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 4 °C, the RNALater™ removed, 1 mL TRIzol™ Reagent (Thermo Fisher) was added to the pellets, and the pellets homogenized. Chloroform (0.2 mL) was added, the tubes vortexed vigorously, incubated for 3 min at room temperature, and centrifuged for 15 min at 12,000×gat 4 °C. The aqueous layer containing the RNA was removed and the RNA was precipitated by adding 0.5 mL 100% isopropanol and 0.5 µL GlycoBlue™ (Thermo Fisher). RNA was pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000×gfor 10 min at 4 °C, the pellets were washed three times with 1 mL of 75% ethanol, then vortexed and centrifuged at 7500×gfor 5 min at 4 °C between each wash. The pellets were air-dried and resuspended in 45 µL of nuclease free water. The RNAs were prepared for reversed transcription using the TURBO DNA-free™ DNase Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions, and the final concentration of RNA determined using a NanoDrop™ spectrophotometer. The RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using the Omniscript®Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) with 1 µg RNA and random decamer primers according to the manufacturer’s instruction. For quantification of the cDNAs, qPCR was performed using TaqMan™ Fast Universal Master Mix and the appropriate primers/probes (Applied Biosystems) in a StepOnePlus™ qPCR instrument. The sequences of the primers and probes used were: GAPDH Assay No. Hs02786624_g1 (Applied Biosystems), and Applied Biosystems custom designed BZLF1 forward primer: 5′AAATTTAAGAGATCCTCGTGTAAAACATC3′, reverse primer: 5′CGCCTCCTGTTGAAGCAGAT3′, probe: 5′ATAATGGAGTCAACATCCAGGCTTGGGC3′; BLLF1 forward primer: 5′AGAATCTGGGCTGGGACGTT3′, reverse primer: 5′ACATGGAGCCCGGACAAGT3′, and probe: 5′AGCCCACCACAGATTACGGCGGT3′. Assays, either radiation treatment and no radiation treatment (control), were performed on at least three biological replicates of each treatment and three technical replicates of each cDNA sample. The mean quantity for BLLF1 and BZLF1 qRT-PCR values was divided by the corresponding cellular control (GAPDH) qRT-PCR mean values for a given sample. For example, the mean value for the 0.1 Gy iron, day 0, BLLF1 qRT-PCRs was divided by the mean values for the 0.1 Gy iron, day 0, GAPDH qRT-PCRs to yield the relative quantity value (normalized to the cellular control). Once that normalization was complete, each sample was divided by its corresponding day-0 value to yield a fold change from the day-0 time point. For example, the 0.5 Gy carbon, day 8, BZLF1/GAPDH value was divided by the 0.5 Gy carbon, day 0, BZLF1/GAPDH value to yield a fold change in normalized mean quantity value between day 0 and day 8 for this sample. 4.5. Determination of EBV Load 4.6. Normalizing Data from qPCR For each sample, viral copy numbers from four readings were averaged and then normalized by the DNA concentration determined by NanoDrop™ to produce the main outcome measure of viral load: copies of EBV DNA per nanogram of DNA. 4.8. Simulations of Radiation Tracks To understand the differences in the reactivation of virus by radiation types, it is useful to look at the radiation track structure of the radiation types used in this study. For heavy ions, energy deposition is highly heterogeneous, with a localized contribution along the trajectory of every particle and lateral diffusion of energetic electrons (i.e., gamma rays, the target atom electrons ionized by the incident heavy ion and emitted at high energy) many microns from the path of the ions. These particles are therefore densely ionizing along the primary track (e.g., the track followed by the incident heavy ion, the so-called core). Moreover, they are surrounded by a region (penumbra) comprising the high-energy electrons ejected by ions [20]. The density of the core and penumbra depends mostly on the charge and velocity (energy per nucleon) of the ion. The situation is quite different for gamma rays that interact with the medium mostly by the Compton and photoelectric effects, which result in considerable deflection of the photon after an interaction and the creation of a large number of electron tracks in the medium. In this work, we have simulated the irradiation of a representative volume (10 µm × 10 µm × 5 µm) by gamma rays, protons, carbon and Iron ions using the code RITRACKS (Relativistic Ion Tracks). The code RITRACKS, developed over the last few years at the NASA Johnson Space Center [21], simulates the primary interactions of the radiation and calculates the energy of all electrons produced in the medium. The secondary electrons may lead to further ionizations in the medium, and secondary electron tracks are simulated as well. The detailed algorithms for these simulations have been described [22,23]. Periodic boundary conditions are applied to mimic the contributions of radiation from neighboring volumes to the volume of interest.
