Red blood cells (RBCs) or erythrocytes are the most abundant cells in blood with 5 × 109cells/ml accounting for 40%–50% (known as hematocrit or HCT) by volume in a healthy individual. RBCs are highly deformable, and the unique deformability characteristics of a RBC are key in the fluid and mass transport processes in the vasculature.1Although RBCs have mostly been appreciated in the context of tissue oxygenation, ischemia, and vaso-occlusion, several epidemiological studies have detected varying associations between hematocrit levels and thrombosis.2–5The RBC composition in the blood clots depends on local flow rates—venous thrombi, which are typically associated with low flow conditions or blood stasis, are richer in red cells than arterial thrombi, which are typically associated with high flow conditions.6In addition, flow-induced hemolysis and device-related thrombosis are causal to complications associated with left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) and extracorporeal membrane oxygenators (ECMOs).7Therefore, it is important to understand how blood flow dictates local RBC distribution. Numerous and excellent experimental and computational studies have investigated the role of RBC concentration, deformability, shape, and hydrodynamic interactions, mostly in straight, stenosed, or bifurcating channels in the context of hemostasis or thrombosis.8–13However, relatively little effort has been expended in understanding blood flows inside a cavity or a sudden expansion, which is of relevance to flows in artificial devices (LVADs and ECMOs) and physiological systems (aortic aneurysms and venous valves). Of interest, a growing body of evidence points to the important contribution of RBCs in the pathophysiology of venous thrombosis.14,15Venous thrombosis (VT) originates in the sinuses of venous valves, which are layered flaps in peripheral veins that prevent the backflow of blood.16The venous valve sinuses are regions of low flow, and flow stasis in the valve sinus is long considered to be a major factor triggering venous thrombosis.17–19The presence of a large cavity immediately distal to sudden expansion gives rise to unique flow patterns in the venous valve sinuses as observed inex vivofixed valves,20in vivoultrasound studies,21andin vitrobiomimetic valves.22,23Experimental flow visualization studies show that these unique flow patterns due to sudden expansion result in differential RBC distribution in the distal pockets vs the center of the channel.24,25However, there is insufficient information how these flow patterns determine RBC transport and local hematocrit distribution in the venous valve sinuses. This information on the interaction of recirculating flows with red cells can also be valuable for the growing interest in predicting thrombotic risks from patient-specific flow patterns determined by the vessel geometry. In this work, we seek to determine experimentally the effect of venous valve hydrodynamics on local RBC distribution. Using microfluidics, micro-particle image velocimetry (μPIV), computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and microscopy, we resolve the impact of local velocity fields and shear rates on RBC distributions in venous valve mimics. We use a dilute suspension of RBCs so that the individual cells could be discriminated without overcrowding, minimizing the confinement effects in the scale-down microfluidic model, and the role of fluid–cell interactions in RBC distribution may be studied without the confounding effects of cell–cell interactions that are prominent at physiological hematocrit levels.26From the images of RBC distribution at various flow rates, we demonstrate that the local RBC concentrations in the valve sinuses are dramatically different from bulk flow due to vortical flows in the sudden expansion. We also determine the minimum shear rates necessary to drive the RBCs into the vortex and show that entrapment leads to a long residence time. The experimental system consisted of an infusion pump for positive pressure driven flow through the microfluidic chip, which was mounted on a microscope objective for the visualization of both RBC distribution andμPIV (Fig. 1). The dimensions of the microfluidic channels are designed to mimic venous valves that are partially closed, leading to sudden expansion, and the channel Reynolds number (Re) was matched with what has been reported previously inin vivoflows.20,27 Schematic of the full experimental setup used for RBC distribution andμPIV measurements. The cutout window shows the microfluidic geometry, including the 30–300μm with a valve angle of 135°. The white arrow indicates the direction of flow. RBC or bead suspension was perfused through the device at constant pressure using a syringe pump and analyzed either by microscopy or byμPIV, respectively.When acquiring bright field images for RBC distribution measurements, the laser and synchronizer were not used; the high-speed camera took direct images of the flow device. A microfluidic device was designed to mimic venous valves using CAD software (AutoCAD, San Rafael, CA).50To simulate the sudden expansion in the valves, the main channel suddenly expands from a narrow constriction of 30 to 300μm. The walls of the valve pockets are angled at 135° relative to the direction of flow. The design was printed on a bright field mask, and using this mask, a silicon wafer was fabricated by soft lithography. A wafer was coated with SU-8 2035 to create a mold with a height of 35μm. The mold was salinized with 95%–100% trichlorosilane (Gelest, Morrisville, PA) to preserve the design and prevent adhesion to the elastomer. The silicone base (Dow Corning, Midland, MI) was mixed with the curing agent at a ratio of 10:1 by weight to create polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS, Dow Corning, Midland, MI). The solution was poured onto the wafer and cured for 2.25 h at 90 °C (Precision Oven, Model 658, Thermo Scientific). The required design was cut and the inlet and outlet holes were punched using a 1 -mm biopsy punch (Miltex, York, PA). The PDMS designs were sonicated in a bath sonicator (Model 75HT, LabX) for 10 min at room temperature in 35% ethanol solution to remove any debris. They were then rinsed in DI water and left to dry for 1 h at 90 °C. After cooling, PDMS and the microscope glass slide (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) were activated by exposure to oxygen plasma (Basic Plasma Cleaner, Model PDC-32G, Harrick Plasma). These surfaces were immediately pushed together firmly to create an airtight seal. The chips were left to cure for 2 h at 90 °C to make the binding irreversible. The chips were prepared 24 h before the experiment to provide enough time for hydrophilic decay of PDMS to baseline levels. The RBC movement within the microfluidic channel was monitored with a 20× objective/aperture 7 (Leica Dmi8 and LAS-X). Microscope settings also included 255 brightness intensity. The images were captured using a high-speed camera (Phantom VEO 410-L). The images were captured at 10 068 fps at a resolution of 1024 × 512 with an exposure time of 1μs. The RBC distribution was averaged from 100 ms duration of frames for lower Re and from 10 ms duration of frames for higher Re. To trace fluid streamlines, we used micro-Particle Image Velocimetry (μPIV). Red fluorescent beads of 1μm (Dyed Red Aqueous trace fluid streamlinesFluorescent Particles, Thermo Scientific) were used as tracer particles. The stock solution was sonicated and vortexed before preparing a 1:20 dilution of the working solution, corresponding to a final concentration of 0.05% w/v. The optical system was coupled with Nd: YAG double-pulse (YAG200-15-QTL) with an emission wavelength of 532 nm and a synchronizer (LaserPulse Model 610036). ThisμPIV system was controlled using Insight 4G software (TSI Incorporated, Shoreview, MN). The images were obtained at a repetition rate between 2500 and 18 754 Hz to obtain optimal images for further analysis. During acquisition, anin situpoint processing was performed as a quick check to ensure that the PIV image pair obtained had suitable Δtand adequate spot size. It was also necessary to verify that the particle displacement lies within the interrogation region for one spot analysis by using the quick point processing tool. This analysis compares the signal-to-noise ratio to the threshold. The detailed image analysis was performed offline, and it consisted of three steps: (1) Pre-processing: The quality of the image was improved by using image subtraction and removing noise using a minimum intensity operator; (2) Processing: A static mask was drawn as a boundary around the walls of the channel. The correlation between two spots was obtained using Fast Fourier Transform, and the image match within a displacement range was provided using the correlation function for each pixel. The peaks in the correlation values were obtained using the Gaussian peak function to determine the displacement of the particles within the spot pair. This information, along with Δtbetween the two frames, was used to calculate the vector direction and magnitude; (3) Post-processing: The data obtained were further processed to remove sporadic vectors using the vector validation process. The validation pipeline involved the use of a reference vector in global validation, local validation, and vector conditioning. The reference vector was calculated using the median of the 5 × 5 neighborhood vectors. The difference between the vector velocities was used as tolerance to remove invalid vectors. Then, the removed vectors were replaced with the local median values. Global vector validation applied a range filter to the whole vector field, which was then used to eliminate vectors with a velocity magnitude outside the user-defined range. The spaces in the vector field due to failed SNR were filled using the local mean of the 3 × 3 neighborhood. Vector smoothing was performed by replacing them with a Gaussian-weighted mean of the vectors in a 3 × 3 neighborhood. Computational fluid dynamic software was used for visualization and presentation of the data (Tecplot 360, Bellevue, WA). All experiments were performed at least three independent times on different days, and each experiment was performed using at least two different channels. RBC experiments were performed on different days with blood drawn from three to six different donors. The data were analyzed using the Mann–Whitney U test to establish significance. AP< 0.05 was deemed as a statistically significant difference. Visualization of local hematocrit in the channel To compare the RBC distributions at different Re numbers and different locations along the channel, we quantified the RBC distribution along the cross sections at three locations, at the entrance (140μm before the constriction), at the expansion (70μm after the constriction), and at the exit (380μm after the constriction) (Fig. 3). At theentranceto the channel, the positions of the RBCs were similar at all Re numbers, with the maximum hematocrit of ∼6% right in the middle of the channel. At theexit, the positions of the RBCs at all Re numbers, except the highest (Re = 18 and 24), show similar plateau shapes. This represents a fully developed flow at the exit that has an even distribution of RBCs across the width of the channel. At Re = 18 and 24, the distributions differ from those at lower Re by remaining flat through the channel cross section, indicating flow that is still developing at the exit location. Hematocrit profiles along the microchannel.(a) Hematocrit distributions across the channel cross section were estimated at the indicated locations entry (−140μm from constriction), expansion (+70μm from constriction), and exit locations (+380μm from constriction). (b) Local hematocrit was estimated at these locations for a feed of 5% hematocrit and represented as mean ±SEM (n= 3–6). The RBC distributions near theexpansionof the channel (blue line) capture the transition in distributions that occur with the increase in Re. We observe that at a low Re of 0.6, nearing creeping flows, the RBC distribution is fully developed ∼50μm after exiting the constriction, resulting in a distribution at the expansion that matches that of exit [Fig. 3(b)]. As the Re is increased to 6 and 12, the RBC distribution width at the expansion resembles that of the entry more than the exit (narrow distribution at the entry vs wide distribution at the exit). At these Re numbers (6 and 12), the flow is no more creeping, and the effects of the expansion are carried further downstream, and hence, the cells are concentrated in a ∼100μm region at the center of the channel. As the Re is increased further to 18 and 24, we observe a sudden increase in the RBC concentrations in the expansion region (blue line). Unlike at Re = 0.6 or 12 where RBC distribution along the cross section was uniform, the distributions at Re = 18 and 24 showed non-uniform patterns. At Re = 18, the distributions ranged between 3% and 9%, while at Re = 24, the maximum hematocrit was ∼12%, which was almost double the hematocrit at the center of the channel. The local decrease and increase in hematocrit levels are well visualized in the heatmap distributions shown inFigs. 2(e)and2(g). Entrapment of RBCs in vortices RBCs in vortical flows.(a) Trajectories and velocities of RBCs within the vortices at Re = 18. The centroid of RBCs in the vortices was tracked frame by frame at 10 068 fps, and their velocities were computed. The RBCs were seen to be in continuous motion upon entering the vortices and followed a limit cycle. The data are based on the average of five RBCs for each limit cycle; (b)average of local HCT within the vortexduring steady circulation in vortical flows, obtained by summing over local hematocrits in the vortices, represented as mean ± SD (n= 3–6, *P< 0.05; **P< 0.01). Development of microflows and vortices with increase in Re To understand the RBC distribution in vortex flows at Re = 12, 18, and 24, and an anomalous increase in hematocrit levels at Re = 18 and 24, we sought to analyze the flow patterns in the channels that drive the RBC movement. Fluorescent beads were used to track the flow patternsindependentof and distinct from RBC distribution patterns.μPIV was used to obtain the velocity profiles from bead locations captured using high speed video microscopy. We visualized and quantified streamlines through the channels at Re = 3, 6, 12, and 18, noting that no RBC vortices were seen at Re = 3 and 6. InFig. 5, we show the streamlines and vorticity computed fromμPIV analysis at these four Re numbers. At a low Re (Re = 3), a small amount of backflow was detected in the valve pockets (velocity on the order of 10−3m/s compared with 10−2m/s in the main channel). As the Re increased to 6, 12, and 18, we observed an increase in the separation of the streamlines, and more backflow into the valve pockets was seen. Streamlines and vorticity distribution in vortical flows.From theμPIV measurements of instantaneous velocities, streamlines and vorticities were computed at the indicated locations at the various Re numbers (a)–(d). RBC distributions from high speed imaging are also shown. The images show that although there is a significant vorticity as seen at Re = 3 and 6, the recirculation of RBCs does not begin until the Reynolds number reaches 12. The point of flow separation advances downstream with an increase in Re. At Re = 12 and 18, particle tracking was possible only at locations where the flows were not too high. To quantify the location of flow separation leading to backflows, we computed the vorticity throughout the channel from the local velocity vectors estimated byμPIV using the equationω=∇×v. The vorticity distribution is shown as a heat map overlay on the streamlines inFig. 5. At Re = 3, we observe small microvortices at the entrance to the channel. At Re = 6, the strength of the vortices increases twofold and the location of flow separation moves further downstream. At higher Re (=12 and 18), the strength of the vortices increases further by several folds, and the point of flow separation is pushed further downstream from the entrance. However, the extremely high flow velocities closer to the center of the channel precluded particle tracing at these locations. The presence of forward and reversing velocity profiles due to flow separation shown inFig. 5suggests that there are regional variations in shear stress on channel walls. The shear rate distribution is computed from the velocity vectors, using the equationεxy=1/2(∂v/∂x+∂u/∂y), whereuandvare instantaneous local velocities in thexandydirections, respectively. Based on theμPIV measurements, we estimated the shear stresses along the outer walls at the various Re numbers (Fig. 6). At a low Re, Re = 0.6 (orange line), the wall shear rates are low due to unidirectional creeping flows. At Re = 3 and 6, the flow separation and vortices result in a stagnation point [as shown inFigs. 5(a)and5(b)], and the wall experiences both flow reversal and forward flow. Correspondingly, the wall shear stress shows a non-monotonic profile with zero shear stress stagnation point at a location less than one channel width (∼200μm). As the Re was increased further to Re = 12 and 18 (green and gray), the large backflow near the wall resulted in a high reverse shear stress at the wall, with the stagnation point moving further downstream. These data suggest that even at Re as low as 3, the walls may experience reversal of shear stress. Such regional variations in wall shear stresses may have important consequences on endothelial mechanotransduction and hence on its phenotype. Low flows in the venous valve region drive endothelial cells to a low grade inflammatory and prothrombotic phenotype. This phenotype supports the adhesion of monocytes, which, in turn, is a rich source of tissue factor and initiation of intrinsic pathway of coagulation.34The hypoxia induced by low flows may also play a role in initiating thrombus development due to its effects on endothelial cells.35 Wall shear rate distribution. The shear rate distributions near the wall in the recirculation regions were obtained from theμPIV measurements of instantaneous velocities at the indicated Re. For the chosen coordinate system, on the right wall, the shear rates are negative for forward flows and positive for reverse flows; and zero shear indicates stagnation point. The data are mean and SEM (n= 3). Estimation of threshold shear rates that drive RBC distribution in valve pockets usingμPIV and 3D CFD simulations Since no RBCs were seen in the vortices till Re = 12, the cell trajectories do not follow the fluid streamlines in the vortex. When Re < 12, the cells do not cross streamlines to enter the vortices, suggesting that only at Re = 12, the energy necessary to drive the RBCs from the main flow to the vortex is realized. In a bounded Poiseuille flow, particles migrate toward the wall and occupy an equilibrium position due to the balance between the shear-gradient-induced lift force, which pushes the particles toward the wall, drag force due to the motion, deformation-induced lift force, and the wall-effect-induced lift force due to the wall, which act in the opposite direction, pushing the cells away from the wall.36For straight channel flows with a rigid particle, the shear-gradient-induced lift force expression is given asFL=CρG2a4, whereC,ρ,G,andaare the lift coefficient, fluid density, local shear rate, and particle radius, respectively.37Although the numerical validity of this expression may not be accurate for suddenly expanding flow with deformable cells, the scaling laws have been found to be applicable and used for vortex-based fractionation of cells based on their sizes.36,38–40Next, the deformation-induced lift force is dependent on RBC deformability, which is a function of shear rate through the Capillary number (Ca) of a RBC, which is defined byCa=μγ˙a/σ, whereμ,γ˙,a,andσare the fluid viscosity, shear rate, RBC radius, and shear modulus of the RBC membrane, respectively.41Finally, the cell–cell interactions also depend on shear rate.42Therefore, for a given particle size, the net lift force on a RBC will be determined by the local shear rate. To obtain further insights into this lift phenomenon on RBC motion in vortical flows, we sought to estimate the shear strain acting locally on the cells. Although at low Re (Re = 0.6 and 3), we were able to obtain the complete velocity profile fromμPIV in the flow separation regions, at higher Re (Re = 12 and 18), the high velocities near the center of the channel precluded the tracking of particles and hence local velocities, which could only be obtained farther from the center, and farther from the regions where flow actually separates. Therefore, we used 3D CFD simulations to obtain velocity profiles in regions that were not feasible to obtain experimentally. We used COMSOL to solve the Navier–Stokes equation to obtain three-dimensional (3D) velocity vectors and compared it withμPIV measurements (Fig. 7). These computations faithfully confirm the velocity profiles estimated usingμPIVincluding creeping flows at Re = 0.6; development and growth of microvortices at Re = 3 and Re = 6, respectively; and the formation of vortices and stagnation points near the wall at higher Re (Re = 12 and 18) (compare withFig. 5). In particular, we note that the velocity vectors from CFD simulations match well at the various locations where experimental data were available and the local velocities were within the sensitivity limits ofμPIV[Fig. 7(e)]. Comparison between velocity distributions obtained fromμPIV measurements (right) with 3D CFD simulations (left) at the indicated locations and at the indicated Re (a)–(d). The dotted line in the velocity profiles (E) indicates discrepancy between experiment and simulation. (a) Shear rate distributions computed by 3D CFD simulations at the indicated Re. The white box indicates the location where the flow separation was noticed and, hence, was used in estimating location shear rates; (b) shear rates along at different Y-coordinates moving with the flow in the white box indicated in (a). The filled circles indicate the shear rates computed by the simulations at any given Y-coordinate, and the curves indicate the best fit. The red dotted line indicates the maximum shear rate corresponding to Re = 6, below which no RBC entered the vortical flows. Since we observed flow separation at Re = 3 and 6, but RBCs do not enter the vortices at these flow rates, we propose that a shear rate lower than the maximum value at Re = 6 (∼1.8 × 105s−1) is not sufficient to drive the RBC into the vortex [Fig. 8(b), dotted line]. But at Re = 12, when the shear rate increases to 2.5 × 105s−1or ∼200–250 Pa (for a viscosity of 1 cP), a few RBCs enter into the vortices, suggesting that this value represents the necessary sideward momentum to drive RBCs into the valve pockets. The increase in Re to 18 and 24 increases the shear rate linearly but the lift force by square of the shear rate, thus resulting in driving many RBCs into the vortices, resulting in a vortex hematocrit instead of a feed hematocrit. In summary, we have shown that vortical flows in microchannels of geometry similar to venous valve pockets result in anomalous local RBC distribution, which can be significantly different from the feed or bulk hematocrit. We have also shown that shear rates determine whether RBC trajectories follow fluid streamlines into the microchannel pockets. TheμPIV-based quantification shows small recirculating flow regions that do not contain RBCs and regions with RBCs that are trapped in infinite limit cycles.49Finally, the vortical flows also result in stasis and reversal of shear rate directions on the vessel walls. These findings illustrate that vortical flows due to sudden expansion can alter the local composition of cellular components and also local shear rates, thus influencing all three vertices of Virchow's triad implicated in mural or device-related thrombosis. Beyond relevance to venous thrombosis, our findings also provide experimental insights into inertial flow of dilute suspensions in sudden expansions, which has applications in microfluidics-based flow focusing for the separation of cells based on size or deformability. Our data provide shear rate thresholds for inertial focusing of cells into the expansions and increasing the separation efficiency by trapping them into the micro-vortices based on their size.
