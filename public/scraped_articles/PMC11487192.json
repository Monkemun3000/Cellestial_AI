  "content": "Protein kinase 2 of the giant sarcomeric protein UNC-89 regulates mitochondrial morphology and function Received 2023 May 23; Accepted 2024 Oct 10; Collection date 2024. Subject terms:Cytoskeleton, Cell signalling, Mitochondria Muscle sarcomeres contain extraordinarily large proteins, >700,000 Da1. Examples include twitchin, UNC-89, and TTN-1 inC. elegans2; projectin, obscurin, and Sallimus in Drosophila3, and titin and obscurin in vertebrates4,5. These proteins contain multiple immunoglobulin (Ig) and fibronectin type III domains (Fn), one or two protein kinase domains, and often highly elastic intrinsically disordered regions. Loss-of-function mutations in theC. elegansgeneunc-89result in slow-moving worms with disorganized muscle sarcomeres, including a lack of M-lines6–9.unc-89is a complex gene, which utilizes three promoters and alternative splicing to generate at least 16 polypeptides, ranging in size from 156,000 to 900,000 Da8,10,11(WormBase). Overlapping sets of isoforms are expressed in body wall muscle, pharyngeal muscle (for pumping in and grinding up bacterial food), egg-laying and intestinal muscles, and several gonadal epithelial cells. The largest of these isoforms, UNC-89-B, consists of 53 Ig domains, two Fn3 domains, a triplet of SH3, DH, and PH domains near their N-termini, and two protein kinase domains (PK1 and PK2) near their C termini. Antibodies localize UNC-89 to the M-line8,10. To learn how UNC-89 is localized and performs its functions, we have screened a yeast two-hybrid library with segments of the largest UNC-89 isoform and identified at least 7 interacting partners with 6 out of 7 having orthologs or homologs in humans2. Interactions were verified by a combination of in vitro binding assays using purified recombinant proteins, co-immunolocalization, and analysis of muscle mutant phenotypes. Two types of protein phosphatases interact with the protein kinase region of UNC-89. Segments containing either of the kinase domains, Fn1-Ig52-PK1 and Ig53-Fn2-PK2, interact with SCPL-112, a CTD-type protein phosphatase. The segment, Ig53-Fn2, which lies just the N-terminal of PK2, interacts with PPTR-2, a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2 A (PP2A)13. Although we do not know the substrates for UNC-89 kinases, or SCPL-1 and PP2A phosphatases, it could be envisioned that some of the substrates might be shared. The Drosophila genome contains a singleunc-89gene called obsc. Mutant and RNAi knockdown flies are unable to fly and their indirect flight muscles have abnormal sarcomeric structures with missing M-lines and misplaced or absent H-zones resulting in abnormally long or short thin filaments14. Thus, the role of UNC-89 in sarcomere assembly is conserved in worms and flies. Mammalian striated muscle expresses three UNC-89-like proteins from separate genes: obscurin (OBSC)15,16, obscurin-like 1 (obsl1)17, and striated muscle preferentially expressed gene (SPEG)18. The most homologous protein to UNC-89 is obscurin, which also exists as many isoforms, including giant isoforms (obscurin A), and shorter isoforms with 2 protein kinase domains5. While obscurin A contains all the same domains as UNC-89, the SH3, DH, and PH domains are located near the C-terminus rather than near the N-terminus as they are in UNC-89. Although UNC-89 is located only at the M-line, various obscurin isoforms are located at either the M-line or the Z-disk16,19. Polymorphisms or mutations in the human OBSC gene are implicated, but not yet proven, to cause various types of cardiomyopathies, systolic heart failure, and distal skeletal myopathy20. In addition to serving as a platform for the assembly of M-line proteins, obscurin links myofibrils to the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The C-terminus of obscurin interacts with an ankyrin protein localized to the SR21,22. The obscurin KO mouse has normal myofibril organization but disorganized SR23. This myofibril to SR linkage is conserved in nematode UNC-8924. Obsl1 is an ~200 kDa protein consisting solely of 20 tandem Ig domains, and in heart muscle is localized to M-lines, Z-disks, and intercalated disks17. Several portions interact with titin and myomesin at the M-line25. However, obsl1 is ubiquitously expressed, the global KO is embryonic lethal, and mutations in the human Obsl1 gene result in a growth defect (3M-growth syndrome)26. PK1 from Drosophila UNC-89 has been shown to be an inactive pseudokinase, with inactivity features being strictly conserved across arthropods31. Drosophila UNC-89 PK1 has also been shown to interact with PK2, suggesting that both kinases form a functional dual kinase hub, where the inactive PK1 likely serves as regulator of PK231. Bioinformatic analysis indicates that PK2 is an active kinase and that a mutation expected to abolish activity is not expected to result in instability Fig. 1.

Bottom right: confirmation of the CRISPR/Cas9 generated aag to gcc sequence change inunc-89(sf22)which specifies a K7816A mutation in PK2. Bottom, left: western blot comparing the levels of UNC-89 giant isoforms in wild type vs.unc-89(sf22). The giant isoforms of UNC-89 are ~800 kDa. The asterisk indicates a protein of nonspecific reactivity detected by the anti-UNC-89 antibodies46. Mutation of the K in the AAK motif to A or several other residues has been shown to inactivate most known kinases40. To assess whether the introduction of a KtoA mutation in PK2 could render the kinase unstable, we tested the effects of this mutation on the 3D model of PK2 using FoldX v441. This yielded a calculated comparative protein unfolding energy, ΔΔG, of −0.15 kcal/mol and indicated that no significant stability change arises from the introduction of the mutation. Nematodes expressing UNC-89 with PK2 KtoA have normally organized sarcomeres, SR, and microtubules, and move faster than wild-type nematodes We used CRISPR/Cas9 to create a worm (Fig.1d),unc-89(sf22), in which PK2 has a K7816A mutation. The strain was outcrossed 4 times to wild type to remove most of the potential off-target mutations induced by CRISPR. By western blot, this KtoA mutation does not detectably affect the expression or stability of full-length UNC-89 isoforms (Fig.1d) using an established antibody10. Surprisingly, unlike all otherunc-89mutants,unc-89(sf22)worms have normal sarcomere structure as assessed by immunostaining using antibodies to various sarcomeric proteins, including UNC-95 for the base of M-lines and dense bodies (Z-disks), MHC A myosin heavy chain for A-bands, UNC-89 for M-lines, and F-actin for I-bands (Fig.2a–c). Detection and localization of the PK2 KtoA mutant UNC-89 to M-lines, the normal localization of wild-type UNC-89 in sarcomeres8,10, is consistent with the western blot showing no major loss of the mutant UNC-89 protein. To examine the myofilament lattice at higher resolution we used EM. As shown in Fig.2d, the ultrastructure of the sarcomeres inunc-89(sf22)and inunc-89(syb1360), a second, independently isolated PK2 KtoA mutant allele (see below), appear as in wild type; there are normally organized A- and I-bands, normal numbers of thick and thin filaments, and normally organized dense bodies, M-lines and membranous sacs of the SR. Fig. 2. Nematodes expressing UNC-89 with the KtoA mutation in PK2 have normal muscle structure. aThe drawing on the right shows a cross-section through an adult worm indicating that the body wall muscle is organized into four quadrants. Each quadrant is composed of interlocking pairs of mononuclear fusiform-shaped cells (23 or 24 per quadrant). The enlargement emphasizes that the myofilament lattice is restricted to one side of the cell. The drawing depicts several planes of section; one plane emphasizes that this is striated muscle with typical A-bands containing thick filaments organized around M-lines, and overlapping thin filaments attached to dense bodies (Z-disk analogs). The black oval indicates the plane viewed when an animal, lying on a glass slide, is examined by light microscopy as shown in part (c).

Note that wild type has mitochondria organized as long wavy lines running parallel to the A- and I-bands, described as “tubular”. In contrast,unc-89(sf22)which carries the PK2 KtoA mutation, andunc-89(tm752)which lacks expression of all kinase-containing isoforms have mitochondria that appear as dots or can be described as fragmented. By comparison,unc-89(e1460)which maintains expression of all kinase-containing isoforms, andunc-89(su75)which lacks expression of all giant isoforms but still expresses small kinase-containing isoforms have mitochondria that appear more tubular or more like wild type.b3D rendering of SIM images of muscle mitochondria of the indicated strains. Note the presence of linear or tubular mitochondria in wild type andunc-89(e1460)and fragmented mitochondria inunc-89(sf22)andunc-89(tm752).c,dThree additional independently isolated PK2 KtoA mutants (sf24,syb1195, andsyb1360)show fragmented mitochondria. Scale bars, 10 μm in (aandc); 5 μm in (bandd). Because CRISPR/Cas9 can result in off-target effects, we generated 3 more CRISPR alleles (sf24,syb1195, andsyb1360) resulting in the same KtoA amino acid change.sf22andsf24are independent alleles generated from the same sgRNA, andsyb1195andsyb1360are independent alleles generated using a different sgRNA. The mutant alleles were outcrossed 3X to wild type. The new mutants displayed the same mitochondrial fragmentation asunc-89(sf22)worms (Fig.4c, d), suggesting that the KtoA mutation in UNC-89 PK2 adversely affects mitochondrial morphology. InC. elegans, mitochondrial fusion and fission are primarily controlled by 3 proteins44(Fig.5a): fusion is mediated by FZO-1 (ortholog of mitofusin 1 (Mfn1) and mitofusin 2 (Mfn2)) on the outer membranes of opposing mitochondria, and by the inner membrane protein EAT-3 (OPA1); fission is mediated by DRP-1 (Drp1), which is mostly cytosolic but can be recruited to mitochondria where it forms a large spiral that constricts mitochondrial membranes. We find that thedrp-1(tm1108)mutant produces large clumped mitochondria as reported previously47(Fig.5b), and that anunc-89(sf22); drp-1(tm1108)double mutant shows the Drp-1 phenotype, i.e.,drp-1is epistatic tounc-89(sf22). The epistasis ofdrp-1oversf22indicates that the fragmentation of mitochondria inunc-89(sf22)requires DRP-1 protein. One possibility is that UNC-89 PK2 may be an inhibitor of DRP-1 activity, and DRP-1 may be more active when PK2 has no catalytic activity. This further suggests that DRP-1 protein could be a target of the protein kinase activity of UNC-89 PK2, directly or indirectly through a kinase cascade. Fig. 5.drp-1is epistatic tounc-89(sf22). aMitochondria are constantly undergoing fusion and fission, through the actions of several conserved GTPases of the dynamin family. The names of the nematode proteins are indicated with their mammalian orthologs shown in parentheses.b3D rendering of SIM images of muscle mitochondria stained with anti-ATP5A. Thedrp-1null mutant shows abnormally clumped mitochondria, whereasunc-89(sf22)shows fragmented (smaller) mitochondria. The double mutant,unc-89(sf22); drp-1(tm1108)shows the Drp-1 single mutant phenotype. Scale bar, 5 μm. In mammals, Drp-1 shuttles between the cytosol and mitochondria, and upon association with mitochondria, fission is promoted48. We tested the hypothesis that part of the mechanism by whichunc-89KtoA mutants have more mitochondrial fragmentation is that more DRP-1 is associated with their mitochondria. We developed an antibody to DRP-1 and validated the antibody by showing that it detects a protein of expected size from wild type (~80 kDa), but no protein is detectable from adrp-1deletion mutant (Fig.6a). We observed no differences in the total levels of DRP-1 between wild type and either of twounc-89PK2 KtoA mutants (unc-89(sf22)orunc-89(syb1360)) (Fig.6b). However, we found an approximately two-fold higher level of DRP-1 associated with purified mitochondria from either of the PK2 mutants compared to wild type (Fig.6c). Therefore, the greater association of DRP-1 with mitochondria at least partially explains how the mitochondria in PK2 KtoA mutants are more fragmented. Fig. 6. More DRP-1 is associated with UNC-89 PK2 KtoA mutant mitochondria as compared to wild-type mitochondria. Increased levels of ATP in PK2 KtoA mutants Fig. 7. PK2 KtoA mutants have elevated ATP levels. Complex I respiration is increased, complex II respiration is decreased, and each cannot be uncoupled inunc-89PK2 KtoA mutants We next tested the hypothesis that the increase in ATP levels in PK2 KtoA mutants is due to enhanced mitochondrial function. We utilized a method to isolate mitochondria from any cell type inC. elegans56to isolate mitochondria primarily from body wall muscle cells. We used a strain in which the fusion protein tomm-20-mKate2-HA was expressed from themyo-3promoter, total mitochondria were purified, and then mostly muscle-specific mitochondria were pulled out using anti-HA-magnetic beads. Mitochondrial respiration in muscle mitochondria was assayed using an oxygen electrode. We investigated both complex I and complex II-based respiration as electrons can take two paths through the electron transport chain: either I to III to IV or II to III to IV. When assessed for complex I induced respiration (addition of substrates malate and glutamate), muscle mitochondria fromunc-89(sf22)andunc-89(syb1360)showed significantly higher rates of basal respiration, and the respiration could not be uncoupled by adding FCCP (Fig.8a). When assessed for complex II-induced respiration (addition of the substrate succinate), the UNC-89 KtoA mutants showed lower rates of basal respiration, which could also not be uncoupled (Fig.8b). Fig. 8. PK2 KtoA mutants display altered mitochondrial respiration and altered levels of some electron transport chain complexes. Increased glycolysis in PK2 KtoA mutants Although the increase in complex I-based respiration might partially explain the increased level of ATP in the PK2 KtoA mutants, we explored the additional possibility that glycolysis was increased. There is precedence for a compensatory increase in glycolysis when mitochondria do not perform well57. We measured the activity of the rate-limiting enzyme in glycolysis, 6-phosphofructose kinase. The activity of this enzyme is significantly increased in all 4 PK2 KtoA mutants (Fig.9). Thus, increased glycolysis at least partially explains why there is an increase in total ATP levels in PK2 KtoA mutants, however, the mechanism of this increase remains elusive. Fig. 9. PK2 KtoA mutants display increased activity of the rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis, 6-phosphofructose kinase. Statistical significance was assessed using an unpairedt-test with Welch’s correction. Uncoupling might result from increased levels of the uncoupling protein UCP-4 in PK2 KtoA mutants That both ETC I and ETC II-based respiration cannot be further increased by uncoupling reagents (Fig.8a, b), suggests that the mutant mitochondria are already uncoupled. The proton gradient across the intermembrane space is generated by electron transfer, but the gradient can be dissipated by uncoupling proteins (UCPs)58. UCPs are a family of transporters that permit proton movement back into the mitochondrial matrix, and some UCPs are involved in generating heat. Thus, uncoupling should result in less ATP production, and the observed increase in ATP is likely due to increased glycolysis (Fig.9). Mammals express 5 UCP proteins, butC. elegansexpress only a single UCP, called UCP-4. Nematode UCP-4 is primarily expressed in the body wall and pharyngeal muscles59. We wished to explore the possibility that the level of UCP-4 is altered in the PK2 KtoA mutants. We created a CRISPR/Cas9 strain in which UCP-4 has an HA tag at its C-terminus, and this strain was crossed intounc-89(sf22)andunc-89(syb1360). As shown in Fig.10, the level of UCP-4 protein, but not mRNA, is increased in PK2 KtoA mutants. The higher level of UCP-4 likely explains the uncoupled state of PK2 KtoA mutants, but why UCP-4 levels are increased awaits further study. Fig. 10. PK2 KtoA mutants have elevated levels of UCP-4 protein but not mRNA. Increasing the level of PK2 increases mitochondrial clumping and decreases DRP-1 associated with mitochondria We first performed bioinformatics analysis indicating that UNC-89 PK2 is a canonical active protein kinase and that a particular missense mutation (KtoA) is expected to abolish activity but not the stability of the protein. We used CRISPR/Cas9 to create worms that express UNC-89 isoforms with catalytically inactive PK2 protein kinase domains and we observed an unexpected and specific phenotype. In contrast to all previously describedunc-89loss of function mutants, these worms have normal sarcomere and SR structures and move faster than the wild type. In addition, PK2 KtoA mutants have fragmented mitochondria. Although mitochondrial fragmentation is usually associated with decreased mitochondrial function, we found that ATP levels were increased and complex I basal respiration was increased and was already uncoupled, and there was no obvious increase in complex I proteins. Nevertheless, complex II basal respiration was decreased and the level of complex II was decreased. Thus, it seems that the effect of PK2 KtoA mutation both increases and decreases mitochondrial function. The observed increase in glycolysis might be a compensatory response to altered mitochondrial respiration. We gained molecular insight into how the mitochondria are fragmented. The conserved GTPase Drp1 is required for mitochondrial fragmentation, and in mammals, this occurs by recruitment of Drp1 to the outer membrane by adaptors, then oligomerization, recruitment of dynamin 2, and membrane scission60. We found that there is more DRP-1 associated with mitochondria of PK2 KtoA mutants, thus explaining the higher degree of fragmentation. Conversely, increasing the level of wild-type PK2 by transgenic overexpression increases mitochondrial clumping and decreases DRP-1 associated with mitochondria. The association of Drp1 is known to be regulated by phosphorylation in a complex manner, some phosphorylation sites promoting association, others inhibiting it48. Our finding that geneticallydrp-1is epistatic tounc-89(sf22)is consistent with the DRP-1 protein being a direct or indirect target of UNC-89 PK2 protein kinase activity. That both complex I and complex II respiration could not be further uncoupled led us to postulate that the mitochondria are already uncoupled. The proton gradient across the intermembrane space can be dissipated by uncoupling proteins which transport protons back into the mitochondrial matrix. Although mammals express 5 UCP proteins,C. elegansexpresses only a single UCP, UCP-4. This allowed us to easily explore whether this mechanism of uncoupling is abnormal in PK2 KtoA mutants. We found that the level of UCP-4 protein is elevated in PK2 KtoA mutants as compared to wild type. The higher level of UCP-4 likely explains the uncoupled state of PK2 KtoA mutants; however, how this occurs awaits further experiments. One possibility is that the expression, stability, or activity of UCP-4 is regulated by phosphorylation, which also may occur by PK2 or a PK2 kinase cascade. Moreover, more uncoupling means that mitochondria produce less ATP, and thus elevated ATP levels in PK2 KtoA mutants are most likely due to increased glycolysis. Further insight into the mechanisms that generate the phenotype of PK2 KtoA mutants awaits determining the in vivo substrates for PK2. Unfortunately, during the course of this study, we were unsuccessful in producing recombinant PK2 samples suitable for in vitro phosphotransfer experimentation. Nonetheless, the phenotype of PK2 KtoA mutants suggests the existence of a signaling pathway between the sarcomere, where UNC-89 is located, and mitochondria. Such communication would help match the energy requirements of muscle contraction with energy production by mitochondria. In mammalian striated muscle, large quantities of ATP are required to fuel sarcomere contraction and the ionic pumps that drive muscle contraction, and most of this ATP is supplied by numerous mitochondria. There is very close packing of organelles in striated muscle and the spaces between adjacent myofibril/SR/T-tubule cylinders are filled with mitochondria. There is a complex 3D network of mitochondria in mammalian skeletal muscle, mostly in the form of fused or elongated mitochondria61. This organization likely ensures rapid and efficient transfer of ATP to the contractile apparatus62. It is believed that during muscle contraction, calcium ions, and ATP are released into a privileged microdomain and taken up into myofibrils before they have time to diffuse beyond the myofibrils. Because of the close proximity of mitochondria to sarcomeres, even inC. elegansmuscle, and the need to match energetic output to contractile demands, we speculate that there is signaling from sarcomeres to mitochondria that coordinate the structural organization and metabolic activity of mitochondria, and this is essential for optimal muscle performance. Although our studies provide a possible molecular mechanism by which sarcomeres communicate with mitochondria, our study is not the first to provide evidence of communication between these organelles. In a remarkably sophisticated study using Drosophila, Avellaneda et al.63demonstrated that there is communication between mitochondria and myofibrils during muscle development. Drosophila have two types of muscle, fibrillar, exemplified by indirect flight muscle in which individual myofibrils are not laterally aligned with their neighbors, and body muscles such as in the legs in which myofibrils are aligned laterally to form a tube. The morphology and organization of mitochondria are different in these muscle types. In indirect flight muscle, the mitochondria are elongated and lie between the myofibrils, whereas in leg muscle the mitochondria lie mostly within the tube and peripherally. When Avellaneda et al. overexpressed a mitofusin homolog required for mitochondrial fusion or expressed a dominant negative Drp1 required for fission, the morphology of indirect flight muscle resembled leg muscle with myofibrils aligned laterally and often forming tubes and mitochondria located inside. Bioinformatics analysis of PK2 Three-dimensional structural models of UNC-89-PK2 (UniProtKBO01761) were calculated using AlphaFold v2.3.168as implemented in the ColabFold 1.5.5 server (https://colab.research.google.com/github/sokrypton/ColabFold/blob/main/AlphaFold2.ipynb). In order to estimate the effect of the KtoA mutation (K7816A in UniProtKBO01761) on kinase stability, we calculated a comparative protein unfolding energy, ΔΔG, between wild type and in silico mutated PK2 models, where ΔΔG = ΔGKtoA– ΔGwt. To calculate the ΔΔG value, the best-ranking AlphaFold model was used as template in FoldX v441, applying the RepairPDB function for gentle model equilibration, followed by the introduction of the KtoA mutation using the PositionScan function, as described in ref.69.

For pharyngeal muscle imaging, the fixed adult day 1 worms were incubated with anti-UNC-89 (EU30) at 1:100, and anti-myosin heavy chain C (MHC C; mouse monoclonal 9.2.175) at 1:100. Secondary antibodies, used at 1:200 dilution, included anti-rabbit Alexa 488, and anti-mouse Alexa 594, all purchased from Invitrogen. Confocal images were captured at room temperature with a Zeiss confocal system (LSM510) equipped with an Axiovert 100 M microscope and an Apochromat x63/1.4 numerical aperture oil immersion objective, in 1× and 2.5× zoom mode. For the confocal images, the color balances were adjusted by using Adobe Photoshop (Adobe, San Jose, CA). Super-resolution microscopy was performed using a Nikon N-SIM system in 3D structured illumination mode on an Eclipse Ti-E microscope equipped with a 100×/1.49 NA oil immersion objective, 561-nm solid-state laser, and an EM-CCD camera (DU-897, Andor Technology). Super-resolution images were reconstructed using the N-SIM module in NIS-Elements software. The color balances of the images were adjusted by using Adobe Photoshop (Adobe, San Jose, CA). A Z-series every 0.2 μm was taken from the outer muscle cell membrane deeper into the muscle cell. This Z stack was then reconstructed into a 3D image using software on the N-SIM microscope. The reconstructed 3D z-stacks were analyzed using Imaris 8.6 (Bitplane), to visualize the mitochondria. Electron microscopy of body wall muscle was performed as described in Matsunaga et al.45. From each strain, approximately 200 days 2 adults were fixed and processed, and approximately 10 randomly selected ultrathin sections were examined. Approximately 30 low-powered images were captured that revealed all of the sarcomeres of single body wall muscle cells, and from these 10–20 images at higher magnification were captured that revealed 1–2 sarcomeres each. All these images were examined by two individuals both on a computer screen and by printouts, looking for any differences between the wild type and the two mutant alleles,sf22andsyb1360. Representative images are shown in Fig.2d. Crawling assays and NemaFlex force measurement For crawling assays, day two adults were harvested from one 6 cm NGM OP50 seeded plate with M9 buffer, and a final wash in M9 containing 0.2 g/L gelatin. Five microliters of worm suspension were added to the center of a 6 cm unseeded NGM plate and then the excess liquid was removed using a twisted KimWipe. After a five-minute adaptation time, worm crawling movement was recorded using a dissecting stereoscopic microscope fitted with a CMOS camera (Thorlabs). For all strains a total of fifteen, 10-s. videos were recorded from various sections of the plate with each video tracking an average of 8 individual animals. Video data was analyzed by Image J WrmTracker software plug-in to obtain body bends per second (BBPS) for individual animals. Worms that moved out of frame and outliers were removed during data analysis and an average of 20 animals were analyzed for each strain. The resulting BBPS values for each mutant strain were compared to the wild type and further tested for statistically significant differences using Welch’sT-test. Generation of antibodies to DRP-1 Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were generated to the C-terminal 143 residues of DRP-1b, amino acids 570-712. The coding sequence of this segment was amplified by PCR from a cDNA pool (RB2 library) and cloned into vectors pGEX-KK1 and pMAL-KK, to express glutathione S-transferase (GST) and MBP fusion proteins in E. coli77. In brief, to express each fusion protein, the plasmids were transformed into E. coli Rosetta 2 (DE3) (Millipore Corporation, cat. no. 71397-4), and grown in Luria-Bertani broth containing 10 µg/ml ampicillin at 37° to OD600= 0.6–0.8, followed by induction of expression with 0.5 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside at 20° for 5 h. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 containing 100 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and cOmplete Mini protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Inc., cat. no. 11836170001), and broken in a French pressure cell at 1000 pounds inch−2, the addition of Triton X-100 to 1%, followed by spinning out debris by centrifugation at 12,000 ×gfor 20 min. The lysates were added to either a slurry of glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma, cat. no. G-4510) or amylose resin (New England BioLabs, cat. no. E8021L) and incubated with mixing for 30 min at 4°. The beads were washed 5X with 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 containing 1% Triton X-100 and 100 mM PMSF, and then 4× with 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 containing 100 mM PMSF. The beads were placed into minicolumns and eluted with either 10 mM free glutathione or 10 mM maltose in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0. The GST fusions were shipped to Noble Life Sciences (Sykesville, Maryland) for the production of rabbit antibodies. Antibodies were affinity-purified using Affi-gel (Bio-Rad)-conjugated MBP fusions, as described78. Briefly, the MBP fusion proteins were dialyzed against 100 mM 3-morpholinopropane-1-sulfonic acid (MOPS) pH 7.0, and then 3–10 mg were covalently coupled to 1 ml of a 50:50 mixture of Affi-Gel 10 and Affi-Gel 15 beads (Bio-Rad Laboratories, cat. nos. 1536099 and 153-6051). These columns were then used to affinity purify ~2 ml of antiserum and the antibodies eluted with low and high pH and concentrated with a centrifugal filter (Centriprep 10, Millipore, cat. no. 4304). Measurement of ATP levels in whole worms Use of PercevalHR to measure ATP/ADP ratio The plasmid pRsetB-PercevalHR was purchased from Addgene (Cambridge, MA), and The XbaI/XhoI fragment of pRsetB-PercevalHR was inserted into the vector pPD95.86 via its XbaI/SalI sites to allow expression of PercevalHR from the muscle-specific promoter for themyo-3gene. The resulting plasmid, myo-3p::PercevalHR at 10 ng/ml, was co-injected into worms together with the transformation marker plasmid lin-44p::GFP at 90 ng/ml, into wild-type worms, and transgenic animals were selected on the basis of GFP expression in the worm tail. The extrachromosomal array was then integrated randomly into the genome by ultraviolet irradiation79with modifications (Peter Barrett, personal communication), to create strain GB296,sfIs21[myo-3p::PercevalHR; lin-44p::GFP].sfIs21was crossed intounc-89(sf22)and intodrp-1(tm1108), to create strains GB355 and GB356, respectively. PercevalHR is based on GlnK1 which undergoes a major conformational change depending on whether ATP or ADP is bound. Coupling of GlnK1 to mVenus creates a fluorescent read-out of this conformation. An ATP to ADP ratio is proportional to emission at 533 nm upon excitation at 405 nm and 488 nm. Day 1 transgenic adults were immobilized for imaging without drugs using a combination of a PDMS microfluidic device with channels just large enough to accommodate adult worms and Pluronic F12780. The microfluidic devices were kindly manufactured and provided by Gongchen Sun from the Hang Lu laboratory at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Aqueous solutions of Pluronic F127 are fluid at 4°, and solid at room temperature. Body wall muscle was excited with a laser at 405 and at 488 nm using an Olympus FV1000 inverted confocal microscope. Ratiometric images of body wall muscle were created by dividing the emissions, Em 488/Em 405. Using Fiji software on these images, the total number of pixels with intensity greater than 100 were counted, and the means and standard deviations were calculated from multiple body wall muscle cells from 5 animals of each strain. Purification of muscle mitochondria and respirometry Body wall muscle-specific mitochondria were purified from strains expressing tomm20-mKate2-HA from the promoter of the muscle-specific genemyo-3, using a modified version of the procedure developed by Ahier et al.56. Briefly, for each strain, we harvested a mixed-stage population of nematodes from 2, 15 cm, high peptone plates seeded with E. coli strain NA22. Worms were washed free from bacteria by at least 3 washes of M9 buffer, followed by 2 washes with deionized water. The worm pellets were resuspended in 3.5 mls of ice-cold Mitochondrial Isolation Buffer (MIB; 50 mM KCl, 110 mM mannitol, 70 mM sucrose, 0.1 mM EDTA, 5 mM Tris pH 7.4 without protease inhibitors) and transferred to a 7 ml Dounce homogenizer. While on ice, we brought the pestle up and down 25 times. The homogenate was transferred to 3, 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes, and spun in a microfuge at 4° for 5 min at 200 ×g. The resulting supernatant was transferred to 3 fresh tubes, and centrifuged for 10 min at 800 ×g. This supernatant was then centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 ×gto pellet the mitochondria. The pellets from all 3 Eppendorf tubes were resuspended in a final volume of 600 μl of ice-cold PEB (PBS, 2 mM EDTA, 1% bovine serum albumin, without protease inhibitors). To this suspension was added 30 μl of a suspension of anti-HA magnetic beads (Pierce, cat. no. 88836), and the tube placed on a rotating wheel at 4° for one hour. The beads were then pulled out of the solution using a tube stand containing neodymium magnets (Millipore Corporation), and then the beads were washed twice with 1 ml of PEB, and then resuspended in 50–100 μl of MIB and kept on ice. Mitochondrial respiration was measured using a Clark electrode (Oxytherm System, Hansatech) as described81. Briefly, isolated muscle mitochondria were suspended in respiration buffer containing 120 mM KCl, 3 mM HEPES, 1 mM EGTA, 5 mM KH2PO4, and 0.3% (w/v) fat-free BSA. Complex I substrates (10 mM glutamate, and 2 mM malate) or complex II substrates (7 mM succinate) were added in addition to 1.2 mM ADP to stimulate basal respiration. Uncoupled respiration was measured with the addition of 80 nM FCCP (Carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone), and non-mitochondrial oxygen consumption was assessed with the addition of potassium cyanide (500 μM). To assess mitochondrial respiration, the non-mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate was subtracted from the total oxygen consumption rate. We used Abcam’s “6-Phosphofructokinase Activity Assay Kit (colorimetric)” (ab155898) essentially according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Approximately 50 milligrams of packed worms were homogenized in 200 μl of PFK Assay Buffer, using a Pellet Pestle Motor (DWK Life Sciences Kimble Kontes). After determining the protein concentrations using a Bradford assay, approximately 1 μg of total protein extract was used per assay. PFK activity was recorded as mU/mg protein.
