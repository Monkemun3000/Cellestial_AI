Shapes) Ehrlichia chaffeensisis a Gram-negative, obligate intracellular bacterium which causes the tick-borne disease human monocytic ehrlichiosis. In vertebrates,E. chaffeensisreplicates in monocytes and macrophages. However, no clear cell or tissue tropism has been defined in arthropods. Our group identified two host genes that controlE. chaffeensisreplication and infection in vivo inDrosophila,Uridine cytidine kinaseandseparation anxiety. Using theUAS-GAL4RNAi system, we generated F1 flies (UAS-gene of interest RNAixtissue-GAL4flies) that haveUck2orsansilenced in ubiquitous or tissue-specific fashion. WhenUck2orsanwere suppressed in the hemocytes or in the fat body,E. chaffeensisreplicated poorly and caused significantly less severe infections. Silencing of these genes in the eyes, wings, or the salivary glands did not impact fly susceptibility or bacterial replication. Our data suggest that inDrosophila,E. chaffeensisreplicates within the hemocytes, the insect homolog of mammalian macrophages, and in the fat body, the liver homolog of mammals. Human monocytic ehrlichiosis (HME) is a tick-borne, zoonotic disease caused by the Gram-negative, obligate intracellular bacterium,Ehrlichia chaffeensis. E. chaffeensisis primarily vectored byAmblyomma americanum(lone star tick) (Anderson et al., 1993) and is transmitted transstadially in ticks (Parola et al., 2005).A. americanumhas a 3-host life cycle. For progression from one stage to the next (larva to nymph to adult), the tick requires a vertebrate blood meal (Parola et al., 2005). The major natural reservoir ofE. chaffeensisin the United States is white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) (Dawson et al., 1994;Lockhart et al., 1997). However, several other vertebrates, too, act as reservoirs including domestic dog (Yu et al., 2008), domestic goat (Dugan et al., 2000), white-footed mouse (Magnarelli et al., 1997), red fox (Davidson et al., 1999), raccoon (Dugan et al., 2005), and coyote (Kocan et al., 2000). Humans can also become accidental hosts when bitten by ticks. In humans, the bacteria are monocytotropic, meaning they are primarily found in monocytes and macrophages, and there is a good understanding of where the bacteria replicate (Sotomayor et al., 2001). Although it is clear that ticks can transmitEhrlichiaorganisms to vertebrate hosts (Ewing et al., 1995;Varela-Stokes, 2007), andEhrlichiabacteria have been detected in the salivary glands microscopically (Smith et al., 1976) and by PCR (Karim et al., 2012), it is less clear about bacteria replication in ticks. Although genetic tools for working with ticks are currently being developed (Pagel Van Zee et al., 2007), the available tools do not begin to approach those that are available in other arthropods such asDrosophila melanogaster. In adultD. melanogaster, hemocytes contribute to host immune defenses againstE. chaffeensis(Luce-Fedrow et al., 2009). In vertebrates, monocytes and macrophages contribute to host resistance (Chapes and Ganta, 2008;Ganta et al., 2002) even though the bacteria are monocytotropic. Our group has discovered thatD. melanogastergenes,separation anxiety(san) andUridine cytidine kinase 2(Uck2), are required forE. chaffeensisinfections in flies (Von Ohlen et al., 2012). Flies carrying mutations in the coding regions of these genes do not support infection after needle injection (Von Ohlen et al., 2012). Therefore, to see if bacterial replication in arthropods parallels bacterial replication in vertebrates after needle injection, we took advantage ofDrosophila UAS-GAL4RNAi system (Dietzl et al., 2007) that allowed for tissue-specific silencing ofsanandUck2to determine host sites of bacterial replication. Here, we show that similar to vertebrate hosts, inDrosophilathe bacteria require optimal host conditions (i.e. expression ofUck2orsan) in the immune tissues, hemocytes, and fat body, for optimal replication. Cell lines andE. chaffeensisinfections E. chaffeensis(Arkansas isolate) was propagated in DH82 cells (American Type Culture collection, #CRL-10389, Rockville, Md.). The DH82 cells were grown in Eagle’s minimal essential medium supplemented with 3.5% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Atlanta, GA), 3.5% NuSerum (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ), and Glutamine plus (2 mM, Atlanta Biologicals) (EMEM7). Cells were grown at 37°C in an 8% CO2/92% air atmosphere. The level of infection was determined by examining cyto-centrifuged cells stained with Dif-Quik stain (Fisher Scientific Company, Kalamazoo, MI). When more than 80% of cells were infected, the cells were removed with a cell scraper and frozen at −80°C in cryogenic vials. Bacteria numbers were quantified using a TaqMan-based quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) assay as described below. Purification of host cell-free bacteria was carried out as follows. Cells were scraped from tissue culture dishes. The recovered infected cells were placed in a 50-ml, sterile centrifuge tube and shaken with glass beads. The preparation was centrifuged at 600 × g for 20 min. The supernatant with host cell-free bacteria was transferred into a sterile tube and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min. The bacterial pellet was resuspended in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) mixed with blue food dye at a ratio of 0.6 ml dye for every 1 ml of PBS to help us visualize the inoculum during fly injections. Most flies were injected with 6000 bacteria per fly, however, some early experiments were done with 1500 bacteria per fly. Although the severity of infections was different with the different inocula, the experimental trends were similar. D. melanogasterflies were raised on standard dextrose/molasses/yeast medium at 18–29°C. The following fly lines were used:yellow white(yw) andarm-GAL4,Hml-GAL4,YP1-GAL4,MS1096-GAL4,Gmr-GAL4,Fhk-GAL4,UAS-Uck2RNAi(w[1118]; P{GD2761}v16719)andUAS-sanRNAi(w[1118]; P{GD7580}v31742). Theywfly line was maintained at Kansas State University and used as a wild type in these experiments (Von Ohlen et al., 2009). Thearmadillo(arm)-Galfly line (Sanson et al., 1996) was obtained from Joan Hooper (University of Colorado, Anchutz Medical campus, Denver, CO). TheFhk-GAL4andYP1-GAL4were obtained from Tony Ip (The University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA). TheHml-GAL4fly line was obtained from Michael Galko (MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX). TheMS1096andGmr-GAL4fly lines were obtained from the BloomingtonDrosophilaStock Center at Indiana University, Bloomington, IN.UAS-dsRNA transgenic fly lines were obtained from the ViennaDrosophilaRNAi Center (VDRC) (Dietzl et al., 2007). Five to seven virgin females carrying theGAL4promoter were crossed with 3–4 males carrying differentUAS-dsRNA transgenes to generate F1 flies that had tissue-specific or ubiquitous knockdown ofUck2orsangenes. The TriReagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH) RNA extraction method, as was previously described by our group (Luce-Fedrow et al., 2009), was used to extract RNA from flies or host cell-free bacteria. Pelleted bacteria or fly homogenates were resuspended in 1 ml of TriReagent. Preparations were transferred to 2.0 ml, Heavy Phase Lock Gel tubes (5 Prime/Eppendorf, Westbury, New York; #2302830). Three hundred microliters (300 μl) of chloroform were added, and the mixture was vortexed for 15 s. The samples were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C, and the aqueous phase was transferred to clean 1.5 ml tubes. Five hundred microliters (500 μl) of isopropanol were added, and RNA was precipitated at −20°C for 24 h. Samples were subsequently centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The RNA pellet was washed with 1 ml of 70% ethanol, and samples were centrifuged at 7400 × g for 5 min at 4°C. The 70% ethanol was decanted from the pellet, and residual ethanol was allowed to evaporate for 5 min. RNA was resuspended in 50 μl of nuclease-free water. RNA concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE). Quantification of bacterial numbers for infection/injection and in infected flies RNA from host cell-freeEhrlichiawas extracted as described above. A TaqMan-based, real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) was used to quantify bacterial numbers (Sirigireddy and Ganta, 2005). A total of 500–1000 ng of RNA was used for each reaction. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed using the Invitrogen’s One-Step Platinum qRT-PCR kit (#11732) in a Cepheid Smart Cycler (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA).E. chaffeensisRNA was detected using primers specific for the 16S ribosomal RNA gene (Sirigireddy and Ganta, 2005) (NCBI Accession #M73222). Custom-synthesized primers and probes were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT, Coralville, IA) and were used. The sequence of the primers used were: forward primer, RRG3 (5′ CAATTGCTTATAACCTTTTGGTTATAAAT 3′) and reverse primer, RRG27 (5′ GTATTACCGCGGCTGCTGGCAC3′). Serial 10-fold dilutions of the RNA from infected DH82 cells were used to generate standard curves plotting log number of bacteria versus the corresponding Ct value. The cycling conditions used for the assay were: 48°C for 30 min, 94°C for 4 min, then 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 52°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 1 min. To quantify bacterial numbers in injected/infected flies, anesthetized flies were transferred to 1.5-ml tubes (Kimble Chase, Vineland, NJ) and crushed with disposable pestles in 1 ml of TriReagent as previously described (Luce-Fedrow et al., 2009). Bacteria numbers were estimated from RNA samples using quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) as described above.Drosophilaribosomalprotein 15a(NCBI Accession #NM_136772) gene was used as used as housekeeping. The sequence of the primers used were: forward primer (5′ TGGACCACGAGGAGGCTAGG 3′) and reverse primer (5′ GTTGGTGCATGGTCGGTGA 3′) and Taqman probe (5′-56-FAM/TGGGAGGCAAAATTCTCGGCTTC/36-TAMsp-3′). The cycling conditions used for the assay were: 48°C for 45 min, 94°C for 2 min, and then 35 cycles of 94°C for 45 s, 50°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 1.5 min. Estimation of silencing efficiency To quantify the level of transcriptional silencing in RNAi flies, whole-flies or specific fly tissues were used to probe for specific transcript levels. Fly tissues were transferred to 1.5-ml tubes and crushed with disposable pestles in 1 ml of TriReagent for RNA extraction. Transcript levels of the gene of interest in F1 flies were assessed in the following whole-flies: ubiquitous (UAS-sanRNAiXarm-GAL4orUAS-Uck2RNAiXarm-GAL4); hemocytes (UAS-sanRNAiXHml-GAL4orUAS-Uck2RNAiXHml-GAL4); fat body (UAS-sanRNAiXYP1-GAL4orUAS-Uck2RNAiXYP1-GAL4). For wing-specific and eye-specific knockdown, fly heads or wings were used. For fat body-specific and salivary gland-specific knockdown, fat body or salivary glands dissected from wandering third-instar larvae were used. RNA from homogenates was extracted as described above. Transcript levels were determined in RNA samples using qRT-PCR using the Invitrogen’s Superscript III Platinum SYBR Green One-Step qRT-PCR kit in. Primers were obtained from IDT.Drosophila ribosomal protein 15awas used as used as the housekeeping gene.Drosophila Uck2(NCBI Accession #NM_142984) was detected using forward primer (5′ TGTCCATCAGTCAGGACAGC 3′) and reverse primer (5′ CTCCACTTTGTGGCCCTTTA 3′). The cycling conditions used for the assay were 48°C for 30 min, 95°C for 3 min, and then 45 cycles of 95°C for 15 s, 56°C for 30 s, and 60°C for 1 min. TheDrosophila sangene (NCBI Accession #NM_080040) was detected using forward primer (5′ ACCCGAACAATCAGGAACAG 3′) and reverse primer (5′ ACCCGAACAATCAGGAACAG 3′). The cycling conditions used for the assay were 48°C for 30 min, 95°C for 3 min, and then 45 cycles of 95°C for 15 s, 50°C for 30 s, and 60°C for 1 min. To calculate knockdown efficiency serial 10-fold dilutions of RNA and corresponding Ct values were used to plot standard curves (mean of 3 experiments). Primer efficiency was calculated using the following equation (Pfaffl, 2001): Primer efficiency values were used to calculate the relative change in gene expression by the following equation (Pfaffl, 2001): Parental lines (UASandGAL4constructs) andywflies served as normal controls and were set at 100% expression for the gene of interest. Relative level of gene expression in RNAi flies as compared to controls was calculated to estimate the knockdown efficiency. Adult flies were used to assess the effect of gene knockdown onE. chaffeensisinfections. Male and female flies were anesthetized on a CO2anesthesia pad (Genesee Scientific, San Diego, CA; model# 59-119). Flies were injected in the thorax with 51 nl of sterile PBS-blue food dye solution orEhrlichiaresuspended in PBS-blue food dye solution. Injections were made in the abdomen of the fly with pulled glass capillary needles using a Nanoject II (Drummond Scientific Company, Broomall, PA). Following injection, flies were maintained in clean bottles with molasses/yeast caps. Survival was monitored daily for 4 days. Twenty flies were injected per treatment group per experiment with 3–4 independent experiments for survival data. Four to five flies were used to determine bacterial infection. Survival data were analyzed for significance using the log-rank test of Kaplan Meier plots using Prism Graphpad software (La Jolla, CA). Data are presented as the mean ± standard error (SE) of independent experiments unless otherwise stated.Pvalues of <0.05 were considered highly significant. Bacterial numbers were analyzed by Student’sttest (two-tailed, general) by using the StatMost Statistical Package (Data XIOM, Los Angeles, CA, USA). Unless indicated, data are presented as the mean ± standard error (SE) of independent experiments. Uck2andsanare required for in vivoE. chaffeensisreplication in adultD. melanogaster E. chaffeensisis capable of infecting and completing its life cycle inDrosophilaS2 cells and adult flies (Luce-Fedrow et al., 2008,2009). Recent work by our group found that several host genes control the replication ofEhrlichiain vivo(Von Ohlen et al., 2012). We found that flies carrying mutations in coding regions of these genes were poorly infected byE. chaffeensis. In particular, 2 genes that are relevant to humans and ticks were chosen for this study,Uck2andsan. Uck2functions as a uridine-cytidine kinase and is orthologous to the mammalianUCK2gene (McQuilton et al., 2012) and theIxodes scapularisSCW003812 gene (Lawson et al., 2009).sanis the ortholog to the humanNAA50gene and encodes the N(α)-acetyltransferase 50 protein. It is orthologous to theI. scapularisSCW002560 gene (Lawson et al., 2009). In vertebrates,E. chaffeensisexhibits a tropism for monocytes and macrophages (Paddock and Childs, 2003;Sotomayor et al., 2001). However, no clear requirements for cell or tissue tropism have been defined in ticks or other arthropods. To investigate whereE. chaffeensisreplicates in arthropods, we employed whole-organism in vivo RNAi inD. melanogasterto do tissue-specific inactivation ofUck2andsanusing a fly collection that consists of expressed RNAi transgenes where the inverted repeats produce a dsRNA hairpin that produces the RNAi effect. These tools allowed us to silenceUck2andsangenes in a tissue-specific manner through the binaryGAL4-UASsystem (Brand and Perrimon, 1993;Dietzl et al., 2007) to determine what tissues must be permissive (via their expression ofUck2orsan) forE. chaffeensisreplication.

Comparison of knockdown efficiency of target genes in F1 RNAi flies in wings compared to whole body (without wings) generated usingMS1096-GAL4flies (Experiment 1), whole heads compared to whole-body tissue (abdomen and thorax) generated usingGmr-GAL4flies (Experiment 2), or salivary glands from 3rdinstar larvae compared to whole-body tissue (without salivary glands) generated usingFhk- GAL4flies (Experiment 2) in comparison to wild type and parental lines (UASandGAL4constructs). Numbers presented represent the mean ± SD of one or 3 independent experiments. Numbers presented represent the mean ± SD of yw and parental lines 1 and 2 (columns 4–6). After confirming tissue-specific RNAi silencing effect ofUck2andsan, control and RNAi flies were experimentally challenged withE. chaffeensis. We observed that eye- (Fig. 3A and 3B), salivary gland- (Fig. 3C and 3D), and wing- (Fig. 3E and 3F) specific knockdown ofUck2andsandid not impact fly survival. These RNAi flies were as susceptible toE. chaffeensisinfection as wild-type and parental controls (Fig. 3;P>0.05, log-rank tests). In contrast, hemocyte- and fat body-specificUck2-(Fig. 4A and 4C)andsan- (Fig. 4B and 4D) RNAi flies survived significantly better (P<0.05, log-rank test) than the control flies after infection withEhrlichia(Fig. 4A–D). Ninety-six hours after infection, >80% of hemocyte-specificUck2-RNAi andSan-RNAi flies survived in comparison to an average of 50% of wild-type and parental control flies. When we assessed F1 RNAi flies for bacteria load, there were no differences in bacteria number in eye-specific (Fig. 5A and 5B), salivary gland-specific (Fig. 5C and 5D), and wing-specific (Fig. 5E and 5F)Uck2andsanF1 RNAi flies compared to control flies (P>0.05,t-test). However, F1 RNAi flies with hemocyte-specific (Fig. 6A and 6B) or fat body-specific (Fig. 6C and 6D) knockdown ofUck2orsanhad significantly fewer bacteria (P<0.05,t-test). At the 96-h time point, there were greater than 95% fewer bacteria in hemocyte-specific (Fig. 6A and 6B) or fat body-specific (Fig. 6C and 6D)Uck2-orsan-RNAi flies, respectively, compared to controls. We demonstrated thatE. chaffeensisreplicated whenUck2andsanwere expressed in hemocytes and the fat body, but not when these genes were silenced in those tissues. Silencing ofUck2andsanin the eyes, wings, or the salivary glands of adultD. melanogasterdid not affect infection. Because of the tissue-specific knockdown of the genes in these tissues (Dietzl et al., 2007), the data suggest that bacterial replication occurs predominantly in the hemocytes and the fat body. These data are consistent with the vertebrate tropism for macrophages and monocytes (Paddock and Childs, 2003;Sotomayor et al., 2001). Hemocytes are the arthropod host equivalent of macrophages (Lemaitre and Hoffmann, 2007). The fat body is functionally equivalent to mammalian liver (Lemaitre and Hoffmann, 2007). These data are also consistent with the previous observation thatRickettsia rickettsiiinvade hemocytes in ixodid ticks (Socolovschi et al., 2009). Previously, our group found thatE. chaffeensisis capable of replicating in hemocyte-like phagocytic S2 cells (Luce-Fedrow et al., 2008). S2 cells have hemocyte-like properties and express a variety of hemocyte markers such as Hemolectin(Hml)(Charroux and Royet, 2009), Hemese(He)(Lebestky et al., 2000),Drosophilascavenger receptor-CI (dSR-CI) (Pearson et al., 1995), and croquemort, a member of the CD36 superfamily (Franc et al., 1999). However, because these cells have combined properties of plasmatocytes and crystal cells, we could not conclude that they are hemocytes (Cherbas et al., 2011). We also found thatE. chaffeensislabeled with the pH-sensitive dye pHrodo fluoresced red after injection into adult flies, presumably because they were in the low pH environment of the hemocytes (Luce-Fedrow et al., 2009). Therefore, these new in vivo data add to the growing evidence thatE. chaffeensisis capable of replicating in the hemocytes of adultD. melanogaster. Furthermore, these data are consistent with the behavior of other intracellular pathogens which are capable of avoiding the phagocytic pathway and replicate withinDrosophilahemocytes. These pathogens includeSalmonella typhimurium(Brandt et al., 2004),Listeria monocytogenes(Mansfield et al., 2003),Mycobacterium marinum(Dionne et al., 2003),Legionella pneumophila(Dorer et al., 2006), andFrancisella tularensis(Vonkavaara et al., 2008). The expression ofUck2orsanin the salivary glands of adultD. melanogasterwas not necessary forE. chaffeensisinfection. These findings were intriguing sinceA. phagocytophilum, a bacterium closely related toE. chaffeensis, andE. chaffeensishave been detected in the salivary glands of experimentally infected ticks (Karim et al., 2012;Rikihisa, 2011). In our experiments,Drosophilawere infected by needle injection in the abdomen; not the natural route of infection in a tick. Ticks acquire the infection from a vertebrate host during their blood meal (Paddock and Childs, 2003). Thus, the dissemination ofE. chaffeensisto assorted tissues may vary due to differences in route of infection. Interestingly, in ticks, needle injection does result in bacteria in the salivary glands (Karim et al., 2012). However, it is possible that salivary gland and host physiology may vary among arthropods depending on the life cycle. In nature,Drosophilalive on yeast growing on decaying fruit and food. This could suggest that their salivary glands are better adapted to fight potential pathogenic microorganisms and extrapolation of the data fromDrosophilato ticks needs to be done cautiously. We observed 97% fewer bacteria 96 h post infection in fat body-specificUck2orsan- F1 RNAi flies compared to wild-type and parental controls. Because there is tissue-specific knockdown in the fat body, some residual bacterial replication should occur in the hemocytes of the flies. Indeed, this might have been the case. In general, when one looks at the bacteria growth kinetics in tissues that are not affected byUck2orsanknockdown (eyes, wings, salivary glands), bacterial numbers generally increase over time after infection (Fig. 5). In contrast, whenUck2orsangenes were silenced in hemocytes, bacteria failed to grow (Fig. 6A and 6B). However, whenUck2orsangenes were silenced specifically in the fat body, the bacteria growth kinetics showed an initial increase in bacterial numbers for 24 h that paralleled the growth of the bacteria in the parental (non-RNAi control) fly lines (Fig. 6A and 6B). Subsequently, the bacterial numbers were reduced (Fig. 6C and 6D). These data suggest that the bacteria were replicating during the early part of the infection in the hemocytes, but because the bacteria were not replicating in the fat body, the activation of the fly immune system was able to respond more effectively againstE. chaffeensisthan when the bacteria replicate in both hemocytes and the fat body. We have previously found that hemocytes in adult flies as well as toll and IMD defense pathways are actively involved in host defense againstE. chaffeensis(Luce-Fedrow et al., 2009). Alternatively, the failure of bacteria to thrive even in the presence of functionalUck2andsangenes in hemocytes might be because there is coordination between the hemocytes and the fat body. Several observations indicate that hemocytes can signal to the fat body to regulate the humoral immune response (Agaisse et al., 2003;Brennan et al., 2007;Dijkers and O’Farrell, 2007;Shia et al., 2009). Thus, signaling between the hemocytes and other immunocompetent tissue such as the fat body may play a critical role in coordinating the cellular and humoral immune response to ensure efficient defense of the organism. In conclusion, we have usedUAS-GAL4RNAi system inD. melanogasterto show that functionalUck2andsangenes are required for in vivoE. chaffeensisreplication. Moreover, we have successfully identified intracellular niches whereE. chaffeensisreplicates in dipteran arthopods; the hemocytes and fat body of adultD. melanogaster. We hope that understanding the tissue targets ofE. chaffeensisin arthropods will help in drug design and RNAi therapeutics for HME and other tick- and arthropod-borne diseases.
