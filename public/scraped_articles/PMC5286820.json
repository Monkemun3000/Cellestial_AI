Skewing root patterns provide key insights into root growth strategies and mechanisms that produce root architectures. Roots exhibit skewing and waving when grown on a tilted, impenetrable surface. The genetics guiding these morphologies have been examined, revealing that some Arabidopsis ecotypes skew and wave (e.g. WS), while others skew insignificantly but still wave (e.g. Col-0). The underlying molecular mechanisms of skewing and waving remain unclear. In this study, transcriptome data were derived from two Arabidopsis ecotypes, WS and Col-0, under three tilted growth conditions in order to identify candidate genes involved in skewing. This work identifies a number of genes that are likely involved in skewing, using growth conditions that differentially affect skewing and waving. Comparing the gene expression profiles of WS and Col-0 in different tilted growth conditions identified 11 candidate genes as potentially involved in the control of skewing. These 11 genes are involved in several different cellular processes, including sugar transport, salt signaling, cell wall organization, and hormone signaling. This study identified 11 genes whose change in expression level is associated with root skewing behavior. These genes are involved in signaling and perception, rather than the physical restructuring of root. Future work is needed to elucidate the potential role of these candidate genes during root skewing. Other root tropisms exist as a result of environmental interaction, which likely impact the degree of root skewing and root waving. Touch responses, or thigmotropism, involves many genes that interact with auxin and can subsequently alter growth patterns [11,19–28]. Plants also determine their growth in relation to the gravity vector, resulting in a gravitropic set-point angle (GSA), which is most commonly associated with lateral organ growth relative to the primary organ [29]. GSA is driven by auxin and TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE 1/AUXIN SIGNALING F-BOX (TIR1/AFB)-dependent signaling, in a process similar to gravitropism [30–32]. Light can alter GSA for different plant systems [33], and light in general plays a role in root patterning and growth direction [34–42]. Additional tropisms include halotropism [39,43,44], chemotropism [45], hydrotropism [46], all of which can alter root growth response (reviewed in [3]). Many hypotheses exist for the underlying molecular mechanisms and key genes responsible for root skewing and root waving. As a result, a wide variety of genes have been implicated as involved in these growth patterns. Hormone related pathways and processes are among the candidates, such as ethylene involvement in root waving [10] and auxin and tryptophan biosynthesis in both skewing and waving [47,48]. The cytoskeleton is also involved in skewing and waving [7,18,49,50], includingWAVE-DAMPENED 2(WVD2; At5g28646) andWVD2-LIKE 1(WDL1; At3g04630) genes, which alter cell expansion through microtubule bundle organization [51]. Many genes involved in molecular patterning, signaling, phosphorylation, and cell wall structure are also involved in root skewing and waving. Guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding proteins [11], cell expansion geneROOT HAIR DEFECTIVE 3(RHD3; At3g13870) with putative GTP-binding motif [13],CLAVATA-related genes [52], protein phosphatase/PP2AENHANCED ETHYLENE RESPONSE 1(RCN1; At1g25490; [53]), serine/threonine protein kinasesWAG1andWAG2(At1g53700 and At3g14370, respectively; [54]), andKNOTTED-LIKE FROM ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA 1(KNAT1; At4g08150; [55]) are all associated with morphological change in root skewing or root waving. The SKU family of genes were identified through phenotypic changes in root behavior, withSKU5(At4g12420) and related genes being involved with cell wall modification and root growth [56] andSKU6(At2g03680) and family being involved with cortical microtubule and directional cell expansion [50]. While no single pathway has been identified in the literature as responsible for root skewing or for root waving, several different pathways have evidence for being involved. This study aims to discover additional genes associated with root skewing through transcription microarray analyses of Arabidopsis roots exhibiting different patterns of waving and skewing. Gene expression profiles were derived from Arabidopsis that displayed different root growth behaviors in various growth environments in order to identify gene activities associated with skewing and waving. Identified genes were validated using qRT-PCR and evaluated using previous studies for likelihood of involvement with the skewing process. Arabidopsis ecotypes skew and wave differently from one another in different growth environments Various comparisons of microarray data reveals different genes involved in root skewing and waving.Arrows pointto control used in each experiment.Vertical arrowsindicate comparisons within ecotypes, horizontal arrows indicate comparisons between ecotypes. Eight-day experiment designed to isolate each permutation of root skewing and root waving and identify genes responsible. Vertical comparisons reveal genes responsible for changing the root growth pattern in response to different Agp– for WS, these genes correlate to skewing and waving phenotypes. Horizontal comparisons reveal genes responsible for differences in skewing and waving for Col-0 and WS roots. Numbers indicate gene transcripts with different levels of transcripts from controls. Significance cutoffs of |log2(FC)| > 1,p< 0.05 The second analysis compared transcriptional differences between ecotypes at each Agp(e.g. differences between Col-0 and WS roots grown at Agp45°). In this case, the ecotype influenced gene expression and morphology at the given Agp. The horizontal arrows in Fig.1show these comparisons. This matrix of comparisons allows two overlapping approaches to using differential expression to identify genes associated with skewing. WS roots skew significantly more than Col-0 roots at Agp135° and significantly more than WS roots at Agp90° (see Fig.1). At Agp45° WS roots skew more than Col-0 roots, but both WS and Col-0 roots also wave at 45°. Quantification of root morphometrics is found in Fig.2, using horizontal growth index (HGI; trigonometric relationship between the overall angle of growth and length of the root), straightness (STR; straight-line length of the root from start point to end point divided by the actual length of the root), and wave density (WD; waves per millimeter along root length). Comparisons involving Agp45° allow the removal of waving as a confounding factor in the gene expression analyses. Col-0 roots showed 24 significantly altered transcripts related to Agp, most of which may be involved in waving. These comparisons are represented by the vertical arrows in the left column of Fig.1, with the numbers indicating the number of significantly altered transcripts from each comparison (significance cutoffs of |log2(fc)| > 1;p< 0.05). False discovery rate (FDR) corrections are found in Table1. Comparing different growth angles to vertical within Col-0 When gene expression profiles of roots grown at Agp45° were compared to Agp90°, 22 genes were shown to be differentially regulated, three of which were upregulated and 19 of which were downregulated (Fig.3a). Col-0 plants grown at Agp45° had roots that waved but did not skew as compared to the roots of plants grown at Agp90°. Thus these 22 differentially expressed genes were associated with a root waving and but not root skewing. Comparison of gene expression profiles of roots grown at Agp135° with profiles of roots grown at Agp90° (Fig.3a), revealed only 6 genes that were differentially regulated between the two growth conditions. All 6 of these genes were downregulated. Morphologically, Col-0 roots grown at Agp135° were not significantly different from those grown at Agp90° (Fig.2). Four genes out of these six were also present among the significantly differentially expressed genes in the Agp45° comparison to Agp90°, with just 2 being unique (At1g09310; a protein of unknown function with DUF538 and At3g19430; a protein related to late-embryogenesis abundant proteins, Table1). Thus the 18 genes unique to the Agp45° comparison to their 90° controls may represent genes associated with root waving, but not skewing. Many different processes were associated with these 18 genes identified, such as cell wall structure (XTH7,XTH9) and sugar transport (SWEET11,OCT1; Table1). Only four genes had altered transcript levels at both Agp45° and 135°, meaning that they responded to both the backward and forward tilted growth environments (Fig.3a). All four of these genes were downregulated at approximately the same levels in both conditions. These genes wereAt4g12490(a pEARLI1-like LTP),THIOREDOXIN H8(TRX8; At1g69880),DEFECTIVE IN INDUCED RESISTANCE 1(DIR1; At5g48485; putative LTP), andCELL WALL INVERTASE 5(ATCWINV5; At3g13784). WS showed 92 significantly altered transcripts related to Agp, revealing candidates genes involved in skewing The genes with altered transcription in both Agp45° and at Agp135° (14 out of the 40 genes previously mentioned) were altered in the same way in both Agp45° and 135° compared to Agp90°, except for one gene. This one gene wasASPARAGINE SYNTHETASE [GLUTAMINE-HYDROLYZING] 1(ASN1; At3g47340, also calledDIN6,), which was downregulated in Agp45° and upregulated in Agp135°, and is involved in darkness responses and sucrose starvation responses. The remaining 13 genes were involved in various processes, including cell wall reorganization (XYLOGLUCAN ENDOTRANSGLUCOSYLASE/HYDROLASE 9[XTH9; At4g03210]) and sugar transport (SWEET11andSWEET12; At3g48740 and At5g23660, respectively). Transcriptome comparisons between ecotypes revealed genes that could be involved in skewing in WS Comparison of candidate skew genes from physiological and genotypic comparisons.aVenn diagram of gene numbers from Fig.3, illustrating overlap of 16 genes. The left circle represents total number of genes changed in WS (Fig.3b) and the right circle represents total number of genes changed between Col-0 and WS in groups IV, V, and VI (Fig.3c).bGenes with altered transcription identified in Fig.3b(left column) were combined with genes with altered transcription identified in groups IV, V, and VI of Fig.3c(right column), resulting in 16 genes. The majority of overlapping gene transcripts occurs with Agp135° – a growth condition that elicited root skewing with minimal waving – totaling 11 highly probable skew gene candidates (HPSGC), shown here in bolded text with dark connecting lines The fifth expression pattern had altered transcript levels at both Agp45° and 135° when comparing Col-0 roots to WS roots. Genes 167–192 had altered transcript levels in Category V (Fig.3c); 20 of the identified genes were upregulated and 6 were downregulated (Fig.3c). Skewing occurred in WS but not in Col-0 in both conditions (Fig.2), although at Agp45°, skewing occurred with waving. For WS roots, skewing was a distinguished morphological phenotype from Col-0. The genes identified had altered transcript levels in both Agp45° and 135°, and are therefore likely involved with skewing. The sixth and final expression pattern had altered transcript levels at Agp135° only, when comparing Col-0 to WS. Genes 193–256 had altered transcript levels in Category VI (Fig.3c); 14 of the identified genes were upregulated and 50 genes were downregulated, meaning that WS had higher levels of these 50 genes when compared to Col-0. These identified genes were likely involved in skewing since skewing occurs in WS at Agp135° with minimal waving but it does not in Col-0, thus is the only phenotypic difference between the roots of the two ecotypes (Fig.2). The genes from the fifth and the sixth expression patterns, totaling 90 genes, were selected as a root skewing candidate genes. Overlap of skew gene candidates from all comparisons further narrows the set of skew gene candidates HPSGC and their various functional groups and signaling pathways that could contribute to WS root skewing HPSGC are reported, with “X” indicating to which process or category each member belongs. SUBA3 reports localization of each HPSGC The 11 genes comprising the HPSGC, indicated by bolded text in Fig.4b, areMYO-INOSITOL OXYGENASE 4(MIOX4; At4g26260; involved in inositol oxygenase activity, syncytium formation, and iron ion binding),PURPLE ACID PHOSPHATASE 24(PAP24; At4g24890; involved in protein serine/threonine phosphatase activity),SWEET11(a sucrose efflux transporter),DIN2(a beta-glucosidase mRNA, involved in glycoside hydrolase, and is induced after darkness),ASN1(involved in darkness and sucrose starvation responses),SENESCENCE 1(SEN1; At4g35770; senescence-associated, induced by phosphate starvation),HIGH AFFINITY K+ TRANSPORTER 1(HKT1; At4g10310; sodium transporter in xylem parenchyma),SALT INDUCED SERINE RICH(SIS; At5g02020; involved in salt tolerance), At2g25150 (HXXXD transferase family protein involved in transferring acyl groups other than amino-acyl groups), At5g66780 (unknown gene), and At3g28310 (unknown gene containing DUF677). Transcriptome comparisons within ecotypes reveal a primary set of 92 candidate genes involved in skewing The primary set of 92 candidate genes involved in skewing was identified by comparing the transcription of WS genes when grown at Agp45° or 135° compared to Agp90°. Morphologically, WS roots skew when grown at Agp135° with reduced waving (Figs.1and2). The genes with altered transcription identified in this comparison of Agp135° to Agp90° represent the pool of genes likely involved in root skewing and not waving, since they were altered in a condition that induces root skewing independent of the classical root waving patterns. WS roots also skew when grown at Agp45°; however, the occurrence of waving at Agp45° complicates the relationship between skewing and transcriptome at Agp45°. It is important to note that only roots were used for the microarrays, and that lateral roots appeared to be similar across all treatments. As seen in Table2, the 11 genes associated with skewing cluster into a few biological categories, suggesting that several pathways interact to produce skewed growth and directionality. Col-0 roots, on the other hand, did not skew as did WS roots, and as such, differed only in waving when Agp45° or 135° were compared to Agp90°. The number of genes with altered transcription at Agp45° or 135° compared to Agp90° was also reduced, and not considered in the list of candidate skew genes due to the lack of skewing morphology. Transcriptome comparisons between ecotypes revealed a different set of 128 genes that may be involved in skewing Comparing gene expression patterns between WS and Col-0 shows how the ecotypes cope with the same environmental challenges presented to them, in this case whether the angle of the growth plate produces skewed roots. In order to determine which gene expression patterns are related to skewing, the relative expression patterns can be correlated to the morphology generated in each of the growth angles. Eleven genes remaining across all sets are most likely to be involved in skewing in various processes MIOX4is expressed in root hairs, stele, and lateral root cap [71], and digested columella cells have lower transcript abundance in response to auxin [70]. Additionally, overexpression ofMIOX4in the presence ofl-Ascorbic acid have increased root growth [72].MIOX4influences root growth responses during stressed conditions [73], but knockouts do not have abnormal cell walls, despite the role ofMIOX4upstream of polysaccharide integration into the cell wall [74]. PAP24is not highly expressed in any root zones [69–71], but is predicted to be in plant cell walls and to have acid phosphatase and metal ion binding activity [67]. ASN1is expressed in root hairs [71] and in the root under phosphate starvation [75].ASN1is also responsive to darkness and sucrose starvation, and may have a role in response to viral infections [76]. At2g25150is highly expressed in the cortex under normal conditions [71], but is not shown to be auxin responsive [70]. In the literature, At2g25150 is described to have a product that is a BAHD enzyme with spermidine coumaroyl CoA acyltransferase activity in roots [77] and is upregulated by cytokinin activity [78], which is evidence for its activity in cell division [77]. SISis not significantly expressed in roots under normal conditions, but is upregulated in the columella cells, root cap, and epidermis of Arabidopsis roots after 1 h of salt stress [79] and 1 hour at low pH [80].SISis also known to be involved in salt tolerance [67]. At5g66780is not expressed in the root under normal conditions, but is upregulated in the root tip at low pH levels and under salt stress [74,80]. Under normal conditions,At5g66780is expressed in all zones along the root epidermis, though not contiguously [71]. This gene is unknown; no other published information exists on this gene. At3g28310is expressed in the procambium of the root in the elongation zone [69,71]. This gene produces a hypothetical protein with DUF677 [67] and is not well studied. DIN2is not expressed in the root under normal condtions, but is upregulated in roots under salt stress [79] and in conditions lacking inorganic phosphate [75].DIN2mRNA can be transported from cell to cell [81], and is involved in a process that can lead to weakened root cell walls when under salt stress [82]. SEN1is expressed in mature and developing root hairs [71], and is downregulated in the presence of auxin [70].SEN1is regulated by both methyl-jasmonate and salicylic acid [83], and strongly induced by phosphate starvation [84],. Knockout mutants are growth deficient in the light [67]. SWEET11is present in the vasculature in the zone of maturation [71], and is downregulated in the cortex of sulfur-deficient roots after 24 h [80].SWEET11is a known sucrose efflux transporter that can assist with carbon transport to the roots in times of water stress [85]. HKT1is expressed in the proto and metaphloem of the zone of maturation in Arabidopsis roots [69,71], and is linked to salt and water stress responses [86]. Knockouthkt1has significantly lower root sugars and higher tricarboxylic acid following salt stress, indicating a role for sugar metabolism in salt stress [86]. HKT1 is also regulated by cytokinin [87], and has a close interaction with ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE 4 (ABI4; At2g40220), where both gene products are expressed in the same cells andABI4binds to sites in the HKT1 promoter [88]. Co-expression and co-localization network of HPSGC shows each member is linked with others. Additionally, other genes pulled into the network are other members of the same signaling networks or downstream cell wall remodeling. Network generated with GeneMANIA [119] Other genes in the HPSGC are involved in sugar signaling and subsequent related phosphatase pathways.DIN2is a dark inducible responsive to sugar starvation [96,98].DIN2transcript is increased in the absence of type 1 and 2A protein phosphatases [96]. Though technically a metallo-phosphoesterase and a type 5 acid phosphatase,PAP24is a member of the HPSGC and may be involved in similar signaling pathways [99].MIOX4is suppressed in the shoot by exogenous application of glucose, which my influence root expression through InsP3signaling cascades [73], which itself plays a role in response to gravitropic stimuli [100].SEN1is another gene induced in roots by phosphate starvation and induced in leaves by a glucose transport inhibitor [101].SEN1itself may provide a link between glucose signaling and phosphate signaling [101], and is highly expressed in the meristematic zone of the root [71]. Salt signaling is another functional group identified in the HPSGC.HKT1has a role in salt signaling in Arabidopsis roots [102], and is likely involved in loading sodium ions into phloem to transport to roots, indirectly regulating potassium ion concentrations [86].HKT1activity is reduced by high calcium levels [103,104], which could point to a crosstalk linkage point between calcium and salt signaling pathways.SISalso has a role in salt tolerance, but is mostly unknown at this time [105]. Some of these salt-related genes are present in root regions that would imply signaling activity and growth determination. For example,DIN2is present in the columella cells and stele of roots under salt stress, whileSISis present in the epidermis, lateral root cap, cortex, and partially present in the endodermis [79]. This work investigated the transcriptional differences between skewing and non-skewing roots. Comparisons within WS revealed genes that responded to the angle of growth (Agp) during the process of skewing. These genes were cross referenced with transcripts differing between the WS and Col-0 genotypes to refine the list of genes that are most probably be involved in root skewing. A majority of the highly probable skew gene candidates (HPSGC) are directly associated with environmental sensing (e.g. salt, sugar, hormones, darkness), upstream of physical growth differences (e.g. cell wall remodeling, cell division, cell elongation). Thus, pathways that respond to disparate signals from the root local environment may drive the root behavior of skewing. However, it is also possible that some of the HPSGC are responses to the altered phenotype, rather than the basis of the phenotype. In order to separate these two hypotheses, future studies could investigate the HPSGC to find the specific pathways and molecular mechanisms contributing to root skewing. Plants, treatments, and morphometric assays Arabidopsis thalianaplants (wild type cultivars Col-0 and WS) were grown on media plates made from 0.5x MS liquid media, autoclaved with 0.5% Phytagel and poured in square-gridded plates (Fisherbrand, Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). Seeds were wet sterilized in 1.7 mL Eppendorf microfuge tubes (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) using a 5-min 70% ethanol wash, followed by a 5 min 50% v/v sodium hypochlorate solution wash (8.3%; Clorox, Oakland, CA), followed by 6 washes with sterile ddH2O. Seeds were planted on plates and moved to 4 °C for 2 days, followed by three days of vertical growth (Agp90°) in 19 °C +/- 2 °C, and 24-h fluorescent light at approximately 80 μmol m-2s-1PAR. Plates were photographed, moved to their respective experimental condition (Agp45°, 90°, or 135°), and photographed again on day 8 after germination (day 5 after gravistimulation). Plants were harvested and fixed in RNAlater (Ambion, Grand Island, New York, USA). Images of 8 day old plates were stacked, aligned, and measured using JFilament plugin for ImageJ [106–108]. Root measurements were processed through a custom R script, available on GitHub [109]. Data were analyzed using R and two-way ANOVAs with Type II sum of squares [110]. Post hoc analysis was conducted using Scheffé’s method. Data processing, comparison tools, and qRT-PCR validation For qRT-PCR validation of transcriptome microarray data, 460 ng of total RNA were reverse transcribed into cDNA using High Capacity RNA to cDNA Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).
