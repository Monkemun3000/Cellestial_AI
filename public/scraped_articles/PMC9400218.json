  "content": "Machine learning algorithm to characterize antimicrobial resistance associated with the International Space Station surface microbiome Received 2021 Dec 23; Accepted 2022 Jul 22; Collection date 2022. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has a detrimental impact on human health on Earth and it is equally concerning in other environments such as space habitat due to microgravity, radiation and confinement, especially for long-distance space travel. The International Space Station (ISS) is ideal for investigating microbial diversity and virulence associated with spaceflight. The shotgun metagenomics data of the ISS generated during the Microbial Tracking–1 (MT-1) project and resulting metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) across three flights in eight different locations during 12 months were used in this study. The objective of this study was to identify the AMR genes associated with whole genomes of 226 cultivable strains, 21 shotgun metagenome sequences, and 24 MAGs retrieved from the ISS environmental samples that were treated with propidium monoazide (PMA; viable microbes). Overall, our computational predictions and validation analyses demonstrate the advantages of machine learning to uncover concealed AMR determinants in metagenomics datasets, expanding the understanding of the ISS environmental microbiomes and their pathogenic potential in humans. According to the World Health Organization, the widespread use of antibiotics worldwide and the slow discovery of major types on antibiotics in the last thirty years has made antibiotic resistance one of the biggest threats to human health, food security, and development [58]. Accordingly, with NASA setting the course to return to the Moon with the Artemis mission and eventually venture out to Mars, maintaining the health of astronauts during long-term spaceflight is of paramount importance [1]. One area of particular concern is the reported increase in virulence and antibiotic resistance of microorganisms in space experiments [4,30,36,49,51,56,61]. Combined with a depressed or altered immune response in astronauts [25,46], there is an increased risk of opportunistic microbial infection. Spaceflight promotes biofilm formation [32], and bacteria cultured from astronauts during flight were more resistant than isolates obtained from the same individual either pre- or post-flight [50]. Mutations also occurred more frequently in long-term spaceflights [24]. An alternative non-mutually exclusive hypothesis to increased virulence or microbial resistance to antibiotics is that spaceflight conditions might alter the stability of pharmaceuticals [23]. In any case, bacterial infections might be more challenging to treat in space. The International Space Station (ISS) is a closed-built environment with its own environmental microbiome shaped by microgravity, radiation, and limited human presence [53]. We and others have shown that microbiomes are dynamic, diverse and sometimes intertwined at the ISS. Be et al. [8] analyzed antibiotic resistance and virulence genes from dust and vacuum filter samples of ISS (treated with propidium monoazide, or PMA), demonstrating that human skin-associated microbes impact the ISS microbiome. Indeed, the skin and intestinal microbiomes of astronauts that spent 6 to 12 months in the ISS have been shown to be altered [55]. In addition, the salivary microbiome of astronauts changed as a result of spaceflight, potentially activating microbes that promote viral replication [52] and altering the abundance of some antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes [35]. The ISS itself also presents specific core microbiome signatures on its surfaces that we characterized recently using shotgun metagenome and amplicon sequencing [14,43,51], analogous to microbiome signatures found in specific geographies on Earth [18]. Further analyses across several missions have revealed that the microbiome of the crew's skin resembled those of the surfaces inside the ISS collected by the crewmember on the same flight [5]. To better understand the composition of these bacterial populations we and others have characterized shotgun whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of several ISS microorganisms [10,11,45]. Although most of them have been found to be non-pathogenic to humans, there are exceptions such as antibiotic-resistantEnterobacter bugandensisstrains that could have an increased chance of pathogenicity [44]. Computational analyses of microbiome data collected in Earth have shown that AMR can be predicted from genomic sequence of pure cultures alone [29,47], but a consensus approach on the best way to detect AMRs in metagenomic datasets has yet to be established [41]. Generally, predictions are restricted to high identity (high sequence similarity to databases) cut-offs, requiring a ‘best-hit’ on an appropriate AMR database with a sequence identity greater than 80% by many programs such as ResFinder [60]. Although the ‘best-hit’ approach has a low false-positive rate, the false-negative rate can be very high, and a large number of actual Antibiotic Resistance Genes (ARGs) are predicted as non-ARGs, thus concealing the identification of potentially functional ARGs [3]. Another method of identification is to link the immune repertoire of the astronaut to the peptides of the microbes on the ISS, but this requires complex coordination with crew sampling and is rare [19]. However, it has been shown recently that deep learning, a class of machine learning algorithms, can expand the catalog of AMR genes and increase the accuracy of the predictions based on metagenomic data [3,13,27]. We then hypothesized that the characterization of AMR from sequencing data at the ISS could be investigated from an artificial intelligence perspective using a robust deep learning framework. For that, we analyzed whole-genome sequences of 226 pure strains (cultivable microbes), metagenome sequences of 21 environmental samples, and 24 MAGs retrieved from PMA treated samples (Fig.1) using the supervised deep learning approach proposed by Arango-Argoty et al. [3], which has shown high sensitivity for detection of AMR genes in an independent benchmark [57]. Overview of sample collection and data analysis for the characterization of antibiotic resistance at the ISS using deep learning. The data are processed in a step-wise fashion including data QC, mapping, quantification, and matching to time of collection and mission. The figure has been generated using BioRender (http://biorender.com) Predictions based on short metagenomics sequences and ORFs partly overlap with previous analyses and reveal new AMR determinants at the ISS surface microbiome While more AMR reads counts were found in Flight 3, we also observed variability between the different locations and flights, and an increasing number of read counts associated with time. For instance, location 4 (L4, surface of the dining table) increased the number of AMR reads counts with successive flights (Fig.2b, c). While resistance to ‘beta lactams’ was evenly distributed across flights and locations, resistance to ‘polymyxin’ and especially ‘peptide’ represents a more significant proportion of AMR counts in locations of Flight 3 (Fig.2c). In addition, we also observed the widespread presence of reads related to Macrolides, Lincosamides, Streptogamines (MLS), and tetracycline resistance.

Pearson's product-moment correlation values are indicated Although different antibiotics have different inhibitory zone cut-offs for a strain to be considered as resistant (TableS2), remarkably we found an inverse correlation between the zone of inhibition and ARG count forB. cereus(r= − 0.637, Pearson's product-moment correlation,p= 2.2e−7) andE. bugandensis(r= − 0.517;p= 0.0002765) (Fig.4c), demonstrating the applicability and high accuracy of computational prediction of AMR for microbiome data obtained in space. Secondly, the whole-genome sequences (WGS) of 226 pure strains (cultivable microbes) were analyzed to identify AMR genes (Fig.4a). We found the human pathogensE. bugandensisandB. cereuspresenting many potential ARGs in the MT-1 scaffolds. Up to five strains isolated from the ISS have been closely related to the type strain EB-247Tand two clinical isolates (153_ECLO and MBRL 1077) and share similar AMR patterns [44]. One hundred twelve genes were found to be involved in virulence, disease, and defence in the ISS strains [44]. Our re-analysis confirms themulti-drugresistance (MDR) to antibiotics for the ISS isolates, which is the highest among all the isolates. Our previous research uncovered the presence of genes associated with MDR efflux pump [44], belonging to RND (resistance, nodulation and cell division) protein family, which are reported to be the major contributors of resistance to antibiotic and other toxic compounds to the bacteria [20]. MDR has been reported to play role in the physiological function and confer resistance to substances like host defense molecule and bile, which can lead to pathogenicity in humans [48]. Unlike in Singh et al. [43], we found fluoroquinolone resistance low, and null for fosfomycin. Conversely,B. cereusis a gram-positive bacterium commonly found in food. After infection, most emetic patients recover within 24 hours, but in some cases, the toxin can be fatal via a fulminant hepatic failure [22,34]. Overall,multi-drugresistance was found widespread in many microbes. Third, phenotypic antibiotic resistance testing data obtained from traditional antibiotic tests generated for biosafety level 2 strains were compared with the computational approaches that predicted the presence of the AMR genes, showing an excellent agreement for the antibiotics tested (Fig.4b, c). A disadvantage of the deep learning model developed by Arango-Argoty et al. [3] is that the prediction can disentangle the family of antibiotics but not specific compounds. Many studies have shown the association between several microorganisms (bacterial, as well as phage and non-phase viral sequences) and several cancer features. Although it is unclear whether this corresponds to correlation or causation, the microbiome can undoubtedly be used as a cancer biomarker. For instance, certain strains ofFusobacteriumsp. can be utilized as an independent diagnostic assay for colon cancer [62]. Therefore, a better understanding of the microbial communities and their degree of pathogenicity in surface-human microbiomes in space could also be useful for human health monitorization with detection and prognostic values in long term space travel. Rather than the gather-and-return sampling model currently used for the ISS, new developments in sequencing technologies in combination with Artificial Intelligence will allow for efficient analysis onboard the ISS and in long-duration space missions. We are currently collecting more data for Microbial Tracking-2 (MT-2) and MT-3 missions. We plan to extend the AMR catalog, characterize microbial diversity, and monitor the evolution of AMR in longer time periods to discover new factors involved in pathogenicity of microorganisms exposed to space conditions. Metagenome-Assembled Genomes (MAGs) methodology The paired-end 100-bp metagenomic reads from NCBI Short Read Archive (SRA) under the bio-project number PRJNA438545 were processed with Trimmomatic [12] to trim adapter sequences and low-quality ends, with a minimum Phred score of 20 across the entire length of the read used as a quality cut-off. Reads shorter than 80 bp were removed after trimming. Remaining high-quality reads were subsequently assembled using metaSPAdes [37]. Contigs were binned using Metabat2 v2.11.3 [31]. Recovered genomes were evaluated with CheckM [39], and a recovered genome was considered good with at least 90% completeness and at most 10% contamination. Each genome was subsequently annotated with the help of Rapid Annotations using Subsystems Technology (RAST), and near identifications were predicted [6]. Sample collection for Microbial Tracking 1 mission During the microbial tracking investigation to characterize airborne and surface-associated microbial population aboard the International Space Station, samples were collected from ISS locations, and ground samples were collected from the Crew resupply vehicle. A sterile polyester wipe premoistened with Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was used to collect the samples from various areas across these ISS locations, and the details and description of the sample collection and cultivation have already been reported in Checinska Sielaff et al. [14] and Singh et al. [43]. Pure isolates were selected and sub-cultured, and the sub-cultures were sequenced. Isolates from Microbial Tracking 1 mission To create the whole-genome sequences (WGS) of these strains, shotgun libraries were prepared using the Illumina Nextera Flex protocol [44], using NovaSeq 6000 S4 flow cell 2150 paired-end (PE) sequencing. Verification of the quality of the raw sequencing data was carried out using FastQC v0.11.7 [2]. Quality control for adapter trimming and quality filtering were performed using fastp v0.20.0 [15], and then SPAdes v3.11.1 [7] was used to assemble all the cleaned sequences. Fastp quality control was based on the following three parameters: (i) correction of mismatches in overlapped regions of paired-end reads, (ii) trimming of autodetected adapter sequences, and (iii) quality trimming at the 59 and 39 ends. To determine the quality of the assembled sequences, the number of contigs, the N50 value, and the total length were calculated using QUAST v5.0.2 [26]. Default parameters were used for all software. The average nucleotide identity (ANI) [59] was calculated using OrthoANIu by comparing each of the scaffolds to the WGS of the respective type strains. Identification of ORFs in microbial DNA sequences Glimmer (Gene Locator and Interpolated Markov ModelER) v3.02 was used with default parameters to identify the coding regions and distinguish them from non-coding DNA in MAGs and MT-1 scaffolds that could be used as an input in DeepARG-LS. Minimum gene length was indicated as 50 bp (‘glimmer3 -g50’). Glimmer reads DNA sequences in a FASTA file format and predicts genes in them using an Interpolated Context Model [21]. Prediction of antibiotic resistance genes in short reads and full-gene length sequences DeepARG version 2 [3], a deep learning-based approach for predicting ARGs and annotation, was run with the ‘--reads’ option (DeepARG-SS) for NGS reads and the ‘--genes’ option (DeepRG-LS) for longer gene-like sequences obtained with Glimmer. The DeepARG model consists of four dense hidden layers of 2000, 1000, 500, and 100 units that propagate a bit score distribution. The output layer of the deep neural network consists of 30 units that correspond to the antibiotic resistance categories (102 antibiotics consolidated into 30 antibiotic categories). The model was trained with a curated database of 14,933 genes from three databases (CARD, ARDB, and UNIPROT) [3]. Default options were used: 50% minimum percentage of identity to consider, significance of the prediction probability cut-off of 0.8 as recommended [3], and E-value of alignments (default 1e−10). The software was downloaded fromhttps://bitbucket.org/gusphdproj/deeparg-ss. Nucleotide-Nucleotide BLAST 2.10.1+ (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) was used to identify microbial species associated to MT-1 scaffolds. Sequences producing significant alignments were ranked and the species associated to maximum Score (bits) and minimumEvalue was deemed as the closest match.
