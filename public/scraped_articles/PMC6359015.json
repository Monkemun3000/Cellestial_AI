Survival in a challenging environment requires a coordinated system that enables a living organism to respond appropriately to a change. The environment of the International Space Station (ISS) presents novel challenges for all terrestrial organisms, which evolved in the unit gravity of Earth. Microgravity is the most obvious challenge of spaceflight; however, other aspects of the spaceflight environment, such as radiation from galactic cosmic rays and solar energetic particles, and vibration contribute to the complexity of this novel environment. When terrestrial organisms are transported to the ISS, they respond by adjusting metabolic processes to physiologically adapt to this new spaceflight environment. One readout of the physiological changes induced by spaceflight is in the patterns of gene expression. Plants are extremely sensitive to changes in their environment, and are particularity attuned to changes in gravity. Individual genes have been implicated as important to the altered gravity physiological adaptation through assays with deletion mutants [1,2] and with specific assays of expression [3,4,5,6,7]. Genome-wide evaluations have also provided a large-scale view of the changes elicited by disrupted terrestrial gravity environments [8,9,10,11]. Plants exhibit widespread changes in their patterns of gene expression in the absence of gravity, such as in response to the spaceflight environment [4,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24]. Even unicellular plants are capable of sensing a change in the gravitational environment and there have been several spaceflight experiments that examine the transcriptomes of single plant cells, and undifferentiated plants cells, which also lack traditional gravity-sensing organs [4,19,25,26,27,28]. The wealth of information on the transcriptional changes that accompany the adjustments to spaceflight begins to suggest common strategies for adjusting to the spaceflight environment; however, the underlying question of why certain genes are necessary remains unanswered. One group of genes strongly represented in many spaceflight transcriptomes is composed of the heat shock transcription factors and proteins that comprise the Heat Shock Factor network [15,19]. Heat Shock Factors (HSFs) are transcription factors that activate the expression of genes in response to almost any environmental stress and are essential to the cellular homeostatic control mechanisms (for review, please see [29]). HSF genes are evolutionarily conserved and are represented in the genomes of almost every organism. Given the conservation of the HSF network and its general roles in stress responses, it was perhaps not surprising to see HSFs represented in the response to spaceflight in plants. Their particularly strong representation in cell cultures; however, suggested HSFs could play a unique role in the spaceflight response of undifferentiated cells [4]. One hallmark of cellular stress is the accumulation of denatured proteins. The main gene targets of HSF-induced transcriptional activation are the stress response proteins that act as molecular chaperones [29,30,31,32]. These chaperones not only protect a cell from denatured protein accumulation, but also assure proper protein folding and maturation of newly synthesized proteins indispensable in response to stress. The Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs) are the main chaperones of the folding machinery, but there are also other non-chaperone proteins assisting in efficient protein maturation [33,34,35]. For instance, a pair of enzymes, including a disulfide carrier protein (protein disulfide isomerase, PDI), and a disulfide-generating enzyme (endoplasmic oxidoreductin-1, ERO1 and protein disulfide isomerase, PDI, PDIs/ERO1) catalyze oxidative protein folding by creating disulfide bonds, thereby assisting in proper protein sorting [36,37]. Protein folding occurs within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which also serves as the main hub for the secretory pathways and protein delivery to their final destinations. The ER uses an extensive surveillance called the Endoplasmic Reticulum Quality Control (ERQC) system, which assures that only properly folded proteins exit the ER and maintains proper physiological homeostasis in the ER [38]. When there is an accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER, a stress signal is emitted. Initially, a cell activates the unfolded protein response (UPR) intended to increase the ER folding capacity in an attempt to refold the aberrant proteins [39,40]. If these UPR solutions to the unfolded protein accumulation problem fail, or if the accumulation of misfolded proteins is massive, then the final UPR step—the endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation (ERAD)—is activated. The ERAD eliminates and destroys the misfolded proteins via proteasome digestion, preventing further protein aggregation. The luminal lectin OS9 in cooperation with a membrane spanning protein SEL1/HRD3 recognizes the unfolded glycosylated proteins which are then ubiquitinylated by the HRD1 E3 ligase, removed from the ER lumen, and degraded by the 26S proteasome in the cytoplasm [41,42]. Taken collectively, ER homeostasis works as a sensor for environmental stimuli, and the ER stress signal initiates a subcellular stress response system that can secure protein homeostasis during environmental changes [43,44]. TheHsfA2gene is a member of the large family ofHsfgenes in the HSF network and is a key regulator of the defense response via HSP chaperone transcriptional activation to several types of environmental stresses, namely extreme temperatures (high and low), hydrogen peroxide, and high light intensity [45,46,47]. The HSFA2 protein has been demonstrated itself to be the main coordinator of the UPR during heat stress [48]. The critical involvement of HSFA2 in the response to extreme environments makes it an excellent target candidate for studying the effects of spaceflight on plants and to test if plants use the same universal stress response mechanism evolved terrestrially to accommodate the novel space gravitational environment. HSFA2 may also have an additional role in the physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment beyond the UPR induction of the chaperone-based protein folding machinery. The genes encoding HSFs and HSPs were reported to be upregulated in spaceflight in many biological systems [26,49]. TheHsfA2gene specifically was the highest upregulated gene in the wild typeArabidopsiscell cultures after 12 days in space [4,19]. Moreover, HSFA2 was shown to function in amplification of the signal in response to brassinosteroids, calcium, and auxin and was reported to be affected inArabidopsisin spaceflight, and therefore has the potential for playing a role in the gravity sensing signal transduction cascade [13,20,50]. In the unicellular yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), the HSF targets represent nearly 3% of the genome and the diversity of their functions supports a broad role for HSF in coordinating the multitude of cellular processes occurring in normal and stressful conditions [51]. Since the HSFs play a role in various cellular processes such as development, cellular lifespan, cell differentiation and proliferation, the likelihood that HSFA2 will play some role in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight increases [52,53].

The HsfA2 Expression Levels across Samples 2.2. Different Genes Characterize the Physiological Adaptation of the WT and HSFA2 KO Cells to Spaceflight 2.2.1. The Genes Characterizing the Physiological Adaptation of WT Cells to Spaceflight—FWt: GWt Heat map visualizing the expression of significantly differentially expressed genes: 78 genes of the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in WT cells obtained from the FWt: GWtgroup comparison, and 221 genes of the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in HSFA2 KO cells obtained from the FHsf: GHsfgroup comparison. The upregulated genes identified from the FWt: GWtgroup comparison represented genes that were overexpressed in WT cells in spaceflight compared to the WT cells on the ground. These genes primarily fell under two GO terms of biological process ontology: response to stimulus (GO:0050896) and regulation of biological processes (GO:0050789). Many of these genes are associated with defense, wounding, and cell wall metabolism (Table A1). The downregulated genes identified from FWt: GWtgroup comparison represented genes that were downregulated in WT cells in spaceflight compared to the WT cells on the ground. These genes primarily fell under the regulation of biological process GO term (GO:0050789) and under the categories of endomembrane systems (GO:0012505) and Golgi associated (GO:0005794). Many of these genes are associated with cellular transport and receptors (Table A1). 2.2.2. HSFA2 KO Cells Changed the Expression of Three Times More Genes than Seen in WT Cells—FHsf: GHsf The upregulated genes identified from FHsf: GHsfgroup comparison represented genes that were overexpressed in HSFA2 KO cells in spaceflight compared to the HSFA2 KO cells on the ground. These genes primarily fell under 3 GO terms of biological process ontology: the defense response genes to other organism (GO:0098542), including response to wounding, cellular response to sucrose starvation (GO:0043617) and valine, leucine, and isoleucine degradation (GO:0009083) (seeTable A1). The downregulated genes identified from FHsf: GHsfgroup comparison represented genes that were underexpressed in HSFA2 KO cells in spaceflight compared to the HSFA2 KO cells on the ground. These genes primarily fell under 2 GO terms of biological process ontology: closely related growth, developmental process (GO:0032502) and anatomical structure morphogenesis (GO:0009653), particularly those involved in cell elongation, cell wall loosening, and multidimensional cell growth. These downregulated genes also fell under 2 GO terms of the cellular component ontology: plant-type cell wall (GO:0009505) and plasma membrane (GO:0005886) (seeTable A1). 2.3. WT and HSFA2 KO Show More Difference in Gene Expression Profiles in Their Ground-Adapted State than in Spaceflight-Adapted State 2.3.1. Genotype Specific Genes of the Ground-Adapted State—GHsf: GWt Heat map visualizing the expression of significantly differentially expressed genes: 349 genes of the ground-adapted state between HSFA2 KO and WT cells obtained from GHsf: GWtgroup comparison and 220 genes of the spaceflight-adapted state between HSFA2 KO and WT cells obtained from FHsf: FWtgroup comparison. In the HSFA2 KO and WT ground-adapted state, the upregulated genes identified from the GHsf: GWtgroup comparison represented genes that were overexpressed in cells disabled in HSFA2 KO on the ground compared to WT cells on the ground. These genes primarily fell under multiple GO terms of biological process ontology: response to stimulus (GO:0050896) and defense response to other organism (GO:0098542), particularly to: nematode, fungus, bacterium and to wounding, water deprivation (GO:0009414) related to high salinity, response to endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) (GO:0034976) and unfolded protein response (UPR) (GO:0006986) and response to misfolded protein (GO:0051788), localization (GO:0051179), transport (GO:0006810), establishment of localization (GO:0051234) (seeTable A2). In the HSFA2 KO and WT ground-adapted state, the downregulated genes identified from the GHsf: GWtgroup comparison represented genes that were underexpressed in cells disabled in HSFA2 KO on the ground compared to WT cells on the ground. These genes primarily fell under multiple GO terms of biological process ontology: response to stimulus (GO:0050896) and response to stress (GO:0006950), including chaperones and non-chaperones, response to oxidative stress (GO:0006979), response to reactive oxygen species (GO:0000302), response to hydrogen peroxide (GO:0042542), response to sucrose stimulus (GO:0009744) and cellular amino acid and derivative metabolic process (GO:0006519), such as biosynthesis of phenylalanine, asparagine, tryptophan and flavonoid (seeTable A2). 2.3.2. Genotype Specific Genes of the Spaceflight-Adapted State—FHsf: FWt In the HSFA2 KO and WT spaceflight-adapted state, the downregulated genes identified from the FHsf: FWtgroup comparison represented genes that were underexpressed in cells disabled inHsfA2in spaceflight compared to WT cells in spaceflight. These genes primarily fell under 3 GO terms of cellular compartment ontology: cell wall (GO:0005618), external encapsulating structure (GO:0030312) including xylem development, cell wall macromolecule metabolic process, plastid (GO:0009536) and energy reserve metabolic process (GO:0006112) including starch biosynthetic process (GO:0019252) (seeTable A2). 2.4. Occurrence of Individual Genes and Gene Function Across Collective Comparisons of Physiological Adaptation, Ground and Spaceflight-Adapted States 2.4.1. In the Response to Spaceflight, There Were Only Four Differentially Expressed Genes Represented in Both the WT and HSFA2 KO Comparisons (FWt: GWtto FHsf: GHsf) The heat map visualization of the selected significantly differentially expressed genes arranged by a specific expression patterns in the four comparison groups FWt: GWt, FHsf: GHsf, GHsf: GWt, FHsf: FWt. A through F designate a category for respective expression pattern. (A) genes were selected by presence among the physiological adaptation genes: 4 genes shared by the 78 of the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in WT cells obtained from FWt: GWtgroup comparison and 221 genes of the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in HSFA2 KO cells obtained from FHsf: GHsfgroup comparison; (B) genes were selected by presence among the ground and spaceflight-adapted state genes: 28 genes that showed the same differential expression pattern in the ground-adapted state between HSFA2 KO and WT cells obtained from GHsf: GWtgroup and in the spaceflight-adapted state between HSFA2 KO and WT cells obtained from FHsf: FWt; (C) genes were selected by presence among the WT physiological adaptation and ground-adapted state genes: 10 genes that showed the same differential expression pattern in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in WT cells obtained from FWt: GWtcomparison group and the ground-adapted state between HSFA2 KO and WT cells obtained from GHsf: GWtgroup. These genes were categorized as Required; (D) Genes were selected by presence among the HSFA2 KO physiological adaptation and ground-adapted state genes: 66 genes that showed opposite differential expression pattern in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in HSFA2 KO cells obtained from FHsf: GHsfcomparison group and the ground-adapted state between HSFA2 KO and WT cells obtained from GHsf: GWtgroup. These genes were categorized as Corrected; (E) Genes were selected by presence among the WT physiological adaptation and spaceflight-adapted state genes: 7 genes that showed the opposite differential expression pattern in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in WT cells obtained from FWt: GWtcomparison group and the spaceflight-adapted state between HSFA2 KO and WT cells obtained from FHsf: FWtgroup. These genes were categorized asHsfA2-dependent. In addition, reflect WT genotypic adaptation; (F) genes were selected by presence among the HSFA2 KO physiological adaptation and spaceflight-adapted state genes: 53 genes that showed the same differential expression pattern in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in HSFA2 KO cells obtained from FHsf: GHsfcomparison group and the spaceflight-adapted state between HSFA2 KO and WT cells obtained from FHsf: FWtgroup. These genes were categorized as Compensated, and reflect HSFA2 KO genotypic adaptation. 2.4.2. Only 28 Genes Differentially Expressed Between the Two Genotypes in the Ground-Adapted State were also Differentially Expressed in the Spaceflight-Adapted State (GHsf: GWtto FHsf: FWt) Among these genes were those representing response to toxic substance ontology (At2g29490-ATGSTU1 glutathione S-transferase tau 1, At2g29470-ATGSTU3 glutathione S-transferase tau 3, At1g17170-ATGSTU24 glutathione S-transferase tau 24), and transport, establishment of localization, and localization (At3g44340-CEF ER to Golgi vesicle-mediated transport, At1g29310-SecY protein transport family protein, At1g78570-RHM1 RHAMNOSE BIOSYNTHESIS 1 dTDP-glucose 4,6-dehydratase, At1g71140-MATE efflux family protein, At5g54860-Major facilitator superfamily protein). 2.4.3. Required and Corrected Genes for the Spaceflight-Adapted State Some genes differentially expressed in the ground-adapted state between WT and HSFA2 KO were involved in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in WT or HSFA2 KO cells. The differential expression of the 349 genes expressed in the ground-adapted state, the GHsf: GWtgroup comparison, was assessed in the WT physiological adaptation to spaceflight, the FWt: GWtcomparison group, and in the HSFA2 KO physiological adaptation to spaceflight, the FHsf: GHsfcomparison group. If the gene differentially expressed between the ground-adapted states in genotypes participated in the physiological adaptation of the WT cells but not of HSFA2 KO cells, then it was defined as required. For a gene to be required it had to meet these criteria: WT cells changed the expression of the gene in spaceflight compared to ground control. WT cells differentially expressed the gene on the ground compared to HSFA2 KO cells on the ground. HSFA2 KO cells did not change the gene’s expression in spaceflight compared to ground control. However, the level of expression of the gene in WT spaceflight was similar to the expression of the gene in HSFA2 KO in spaceflight. If the gene differentially expressed between the ground-adapted states in genotypes participated in the physiological adaptation of the HSFA2 KO cells but not of the WT cells, then it was defined as corrected. For a gene to be classified as corrected it needed to meet these criteria: HSFA2 KO cells changed the expression of the gene in spaceflight compared to ground control. HSFA2 KO cells differentially expressed the corrected gene on the ground compared to WT cells on the ground. WT cells did not change the corrected gene expression in spaceflight compared to ground control. However, the level of expression of the gene in HSFA2 KO in spaceflight is similar to the expression level of the gene in WT in spaceflight. 2.4.4. Genotypic-Specific Spaceflight-Adapted State A comparison of the spaceflight gene expression patterns between the two genotypes revealed 220 differentially expressed genes between WT and HSFA2 KO. The expression of these 220 differentially expressed in the spaceflight-adapted state (FHsf: FWt) was compared to the WT physiological adaptation to spaceflight, the FWt: GWtcomparison group, and the HSFA2 KO physiological adaptation to spaceflight, the FHsf: GHsfcomparison group. HsfA2-Dependent Genes in the WT Genotypic Spaceflight Adaptation All genes but one (At4g07960-ATCSLC12 Cellulose-synthase-like C12 localized to Golgi apparatus, plasmodesma), were downregulated in the WT physiological adaptation and resulted in the higher expression in spaceflight-adapted state in HSFA2 KO than in WT cells. These 6 genes were: At5g19070-SNARE associated Golgi protein family involved in proline transport and localized to plasma membrane, At1g78980-SRF5 STRUBBELIG-receptor family 5 functioning in transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathway and localized to extracellular region, two genes, At1g66640-RNI-like superfamily protein and At2g36560-AT hook motif DNA-binding family protein, localized to nucleus, and At2g43240-Nucleotide-sugar transporter and At1g32830-transposable element gene (seeTable A3). Compensated Genes for DisabledHsfA2in the HSFA2 KO Spaceflight Adaptation There were 6 genes out of the 53 which were upregulated in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in HSFA2 KO cells which resulted in the higher expression level in spaceflight-adapted state in HSFA2 KO cells than in WT cells. These genes were associated with ER stress, UPR and vesicle-mediated transport (seeTable A3). The remaining 49 genes were all downregulated in the HSFA2 KO physiological adaptation and exhibited diminished expression level in the spaceflight-adapted state in spaceflight in HSFA2 KO relative to WT cells. These genes included genes associated with intra-Golgi vesicle-mediated transport and calcium pump (seeTable A3). UndifferentiatedArabidopsis thalianacell cultures were flown to the ISS as part of the BRIC17 CEL experiment to enhance the understanding of how cells lacking HSFA2, a key transcription factor involved in the response to terrestrial stress stimuli, physiologically adapt to the novel environment of spaceflight. The WT cells and the cells disabled in expression of theHsfA2gene both survived their orbits in the ISS, indicating that they both had adapted their physiology to the novel environment despite their genotypic differences. Cells disabled in HSFA2 function used substantially more and substantially different gene expression profiles to achieve a spaceflight-adapted state compared to WT cells. This observation leads to a remarkable conclusion about the role of the HSF network in the entire adaptation processes to spaceflight—proficient spaceflight adaptation requires a functional HSF network. This conclusion suggests that various aspects of HSFA2 and the HSF network illuminate important components of spaceflight adaptation in plant cells. 3.1. Universal and Specific Aspects of the HSFA2 Role in the Adaptation to Spaceflight Graphical presentation of the identified processes associated with the universal stress response and specific roles of HSFA2 in spaceflight. The filled shapes represent the biological process; the unfilled shapes represent the genes; red color indicates upregulation/enhancement; blue color represents downregulation/decrease. Text in bold highlights the key specific functions. The HSFA2 KO cells in spaceflight likely have a fundamentally different architecture from the wild type cell wall, along with diminished processes of cell growth, expansion, and elongation as identified by the altered gene expression profiles. Many genes encoding proteins important to these processes are downregulated in the HSFA2 KO cells in spaceflight. For instance, the gene coding glycosyltransferase QUA1 (At3g25140), involved in homogalacturonan biosynthesis and cell adhesion, the trichome birefringence-like 45 (TBL45 (At2g30010)), which functions in the synthesis and deposition of secondary wall cellulose, and XTH4 (AT2G06850), which executes the cleavage and reconnection of cell wall xyloglucan cross-links. It was shown for many plant systems that spaceflight caused changes to the cell wall organization; thus, the finding of this study suggests that HSFA2 may have a role in the way a plant cell remodels its wall to adapt to spaceflight microgravity [14,16,20]. Given that cells deficient inHsfA2expression show signs of ER stress and impaired protein sorting and intracellular protein trafficking, it is possible that the proteins of the cell wall biosynthesis do not properly mature within ER, and thus fail to be properly sorted or delivered to their destination at the cell wall periphery [56,57]. However, the heat shock transcription factor ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae, Hsf1, was shown to regulate cell wall remodeling in response to heat shock in a more specific fashion [58]. The yeast strain mutated inHsf1exhibited cell wall integrity defects in the absence of stress and Hsf1 was demonstrated to regulate the expression of a set of proteins that are involved in cell wall formation and remodeling besides the universal regulation of the HSPs’ expression. The overexpression of a heat shock protein Hsp150 inS. cerevisiaecaused upregulation of many cell wall proteins, leading to increased cell wall integrity and potentially enhanced the yeasts’ virulence [59]. Also, theHsfgenes were found among regulatory pathways in secondary cell wall thickening inMedicago truncatulausing microarrays [60]. These examples further support HSFA2’s specific role in the remodeling ofArabidopsiscell wall architecture in the spaceflight environment. An essential conclusion drawn from examining the differentially expressed genes in the vertical dimension was that these genes were not differentially expressed between the two genotypes in the horizontal comparison of the ground adapted states. Therefore, the way both cell genotypes modulated the expression of cell wall genes during the physiological adaptation (vertical comparison) inevitably led to substantial differences in the distinct gene expression profiles of the WT and HSFA2 KO spaceflight-adapted cells (horizontal comparison) (Section 2.3.2). Summarizing, the HSFA2 KO cells in spaceflight exhibited the diminished cell wall remodeling processes leading presumably to cell wall thinning compared to the ground HSFA2 KO cells, therefore supporting the potential specific HSFA2 roles in the cell wall reorganization in achieving the spaceflight-adapted state. The HSFA2 KO cells in spaceflight seemed to also differ from the spaceflight WT cells (horizontal comparison) in starch biosynthesis (seeSection 2.3.2). Genes central to starch biosynthesis and carbohydrate metabolism, such as phosphoglycerate/bisphosphoglyce PGM (At1g78050), isoamylase 1(At2g39930), and NDHN oxidoreductase (AT5G58260), were substantially underexpressed in the HSFA2 KO cells in spaceflight relative to WT. The reports on starch content in plants in microgravity vary with the experiment and plant species [75,76,77], but it is possible that HSFA2 plays a role in the carbohydrate metabolism and energy reserve metabolic processes in microgravity that contributes to the diverse response of plants to spaceflight. 3.2. HSFA2 is Much More Than a Heat Shock Factor—Things Learned from Space Although HSFA2 is part of the Heat Shock Factor network, the molecular phenotype of the HSFA2 KO in response to spaceflight shows that the gene plays an essential role in physiological adaptation that is well beyond simple thermal metabolism. Aspects of that role are revealed by examination of the gene expression differences on the ground between HSFA2 KO and WT. Fundamental metabolic processes can also be impacted by the environment; carbohydrate metabolism and cell wall remodeling are good examples of where HSFA2 plays a role these types of responses. Genes that are involved in the response to sucrose were also expressed at a lower level in HSFA2 KO cells in the ground-adapted state compared to WT. For instance, the Cold acclimation protein WCOR413 family (AT4G37220) gene, a canonical, highly sensitive sugar-repressed gene [86] was downregulated in HSFA2 KO cells on the ground. In accordance, DIN3 DARK INDUCIBLE 3 (AT3G06850) and MCCB 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase (AT4G34030), both mitochondrial proteins involved in valine, leucine, and isoleucine degradation during sugar starvation [87,88] were also down-regulated. Glucose level may influence protein folding, as high glucose stimulates de novo protein synthesis, making it possible that diminished gene expression of sugar-responsive genes is part of the UPR’s strategy to minimize the level of de novo protein translation and to prevent further overload of the ER folding [89]. This connection further reinforces the link between diminished carbohydrate metabolic processes and adaptation to the spaceflight environment as observed in the HSFA2 KO cells in spaceflight. Cell wall remodeling is influenced by a variety of developmental and environmental cues, and it is well established that there are multiple strategies to achieve an operational goal. The extent to which HSFA2 contributes to the regulation of these strategies was revealed by comparing the expression of cell wall related genes in the HSFA2 KO to WT. It has been demonstrated in many studies that plants in space utilize genes involved in the response to pathogen attack, despite the absence of any pathogens [20]. This misconceived pathogen response could be a result of reduced gravity loading causing a distortion on the cell wall, threatening cell wall integrity similar to the physical damage that the cell wall sustains under pathogen wounding or herbivore attack. Both the WT cells and the HSFA2 KO cells differentially express cell wall-associated genes typical of pathogen attach, but not the same genes. For instance, while WT cells engaged PEN2 (AT2G44490), which triggers callose deposition in the cell wall and glucosinolate activation [90], along with two other genes (At3g43250, AT5G38980) reported to function in wounding and in defense response, the HSFA2 KO cells engaged the Disease resistance protein CC-NBS-LRR class gene (AT1G59124) [91] and NTA Seven transmembrane MLO family protein gene (AT2G17430) [92] instead. All of these genes are involved in mounting a defense in response to pathogen attack, but the gene out of this general class that is utilized depends very much on whether the genome contains an activeHsfA2gene. 3.3. Role of HSFA2 in Spaceflight Adaptive Processes Next, genes that encode transport proteins had their expression adjusted in HSFA2 KO cells to that of WT level, so they became evenly expressed in the spaceflight-adapted state. For instance, the transmembrane transporter genes ATATH9 ABC2 homolog (At2g40090), porin (At1g50400) family protein, and GAMMA-TIP aquaporin (At2g36830) were no longer differentially expressed in the spaceflight-adapted state between HSFA2 KO and WT cells, as their expression was adjusted in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in HSFA2 KO cells (seeTable A3). Similarly, nitrate transporter genes ENTH/ANTH/VHS (At4g40080) superfamily protein, and NRT2.7 (At5g14570) were also differentially expressed in spaceflight to match the WT expression levels of these genes. It is, however, uncertain how the loss of HSFA2 function was able to affect the transport of various moieties across the membrane in the ground environment, yet it seems that these transport processes had attained a particular level of efficiency for adaptation to the spaceflight environment. The spaceflight environment elicited an accumulation of several branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) degradation enzymes, the expression levels of which were also corrected from a low level of expression to a higher level of expression in the HSFA2 KO cells when compared to the expression level in WT cells in the spaceflight environment. The dark inducible 3, DIN3 gene (At3g06850) coding the subunits of the branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDC), and two other genes important to small amino acid degradation, MCCB (At4g34030) coding for subunit β of methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase participating in BCKDC reactions, and ALDH6B2 (At2g14170) methylmalonate semi-aldehyde dehydrogenase (seeTable A3). A large increase in BCAA accumulation can be observed due to environmental stress, such as darkness and carbohydrate starvation [88,105]. It is plausible that in the ground environment, the BCAA catabolism was reduced in the HSFA2 KO cells due to the overall problems with the cellular protein homeostasis, while the spaceflight environment elicited an accumulation of BCAAs, similar to that under abiotic stress, thereby raising the demand for the BCAA degradation enzyme function. Overall, using a knockout line greatly increases the list of genes that are necessary to adapt to and survive in the spaceflight environment and thereby amplifies the information gained from rare spaceflight experimentation opportunities to learn what sort of biological processes are necessary, what genes are involved in those processes, and what factors control the expression of those genes. 3.4. Genotypic Adaptation to Spaceflight An alternative to the idea that genes engaged only in WT cells in spaceflight are dependent on a functionalHsfA2gene is that some of the genes engaged only in WT cells and not HSFA2 KO cells were only required in WT cells but not in KO cells. In other words, it was not the inability to engage these genes that excluded them from those expressed in spaceflight, but rather simply that there was no need for them. For instance, a gene coding the membrane receptor SRF5 STRUBBELIG-receptor family 5 (At1g78980) protein was downregulated in the WT physiological adaptation to spaceflight, but not in those of the HSFA2 KO cells which resulted in lower expression level in WT spaceflight-adapted state than in HSFA2 KO cells. The STRUBBELIG (SUB) receptor mediates the signaling pathway of cell morphogenesis, the orientation of plane of cellular division, and cell proliferation [107]. It is unclear why the WT cells would diminish the expression of this membrane receptor in spaceflight, yet either a function of HSFA2 is required, or an aspect of HSFA2 KO physiology makes expression of SRF5 superfluous in the spaceflight environment. Among the compensating genes with enhanced expression was the aforementioned gene of the UPR: PDI-like 2-3 (At2g32920), supporting the importance of the UPR and likely the ERAD, as well as HSFA2 KO, cells in achieving the spaceflight-adapted state (seeTable A3). WT cells did not need to adjust expression of these particular genes. The ATGSTU25 glutathione S-transferase TAU 25 (At1g171800) gene was another gene with enhanced expression in HSFA2 KO cells in spaceflight. While genes encoding glutathione S-transferase TAU (e.g., ATGSTU1, ATGSTU3, ATGSTU24) were generally overexpressed in HSFA2 KO cells relative to WT cells in either environment, the HSFA2 KO cells further elevated the expression of the glutathione S-transferase genes in spaceflight to compensate for the loss of HSFA2 function in this environment. Similarly, vesicle-mediated transporter genes were among those consistently differentially expressed in HSFA2 KO relative to WT regardless of the environment, but HSFA2 KO induced additional similar genes during physiological adaptation to spaceflight and showed overexpression of such genes in the spaceflight-adapted state. Examples in this category included the Coatomer, beta’ subunit (At3g15980), Target SNARE coiled-coil domain protein (At1g29060) and Integral membrane Yip1 family protein (At2g36300) genes related to ER to Golgi and intra-Golgi vesicular traffic, suggesting that these processes needed to be compensated for the lack of HSFA2’s function in the spaceflight environment. The HSFA2 KO cells decreased the expression of the two calcium pump Ca(2+)-ATPase genes, ACA9 (At3g21180), and ACA2 (At4g37640) resulting in their underexpression in the spaceflight-adapted state relative to WT cells (seeTable A3). Aside from their involvement in calcium homeostasis and calcium second messenger functions, these calcium pumps were also shown to participate in protein processing in the secretory pathway [108]. Interestingly, there was another gene with the same expression profile coding, the RMR1 transmembrane receptor (At5g66160) of the intra-Golgi vesicle-mediated transport. The RMR1 functions as a sorting cargo receptor for protein trafficking [109]. Thus, the HSFA2 KO cell’s strategy for adapting to the spaceflight environment included reducing the protein sorting and trafficking to the destination, possibly to compensate for the basic inefficiency in these processes when the HSFA2 was disabled. 4.1. The CEL Experiment of BRIC17 4.2. Tissue Culture Cell Lines Arabidopsiscallus cultures were established de novo, and each cell line was initiated simultaneously approximately 6 months before launch. Cells derived from hypocotyls were grown and maintained on plates with solid media containing MS salts (4.33 g/L), 3% sucrose (30 g/L), MS vitamins (1 mL of 1000× solution), 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) (0.3 mL/L), 0.5% agar (5 g/L) and kinetin (0.2 mg/L) until dedifferentiated into callus. The callus cells were then transferred to the standard liquid media containing MS salts (4.33 g/L), 3% sucrose (30 g/L), MS vitamins (1 mL of 1000× solution), and 2,4-D (0.5 mL/L) and maintained in a sterile continuous cell suspension culture. Two cell lines, each of Col-0 ecotype, were the subjects of this study: wild type (WT), and a knockout line generated from theHsfA2T-DNA insertion (SALK_008978C) (HSFA2 KO). The SALK line was obtained through The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR), (www.arabidopsis.org) [111]. 4.3. Preparation of BRIC17 CEL Cell Culture Plates Liquid suspension cells growing in log phase were transferred to solid media two and a half days prior to turning over the payload in preparation for launch. The liquid media was decanted, washed once with fresh liquid media, and then decanted again. A sterile scoop was used to place about 1 g of cells on the surface of a 60 mm Petri plate (Falcon, Becton Dickinson Labware, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) containing 6.5 mL nutrient agar media (MS salts (4.33 g/L), 3% sucrose (30 g/L), MS vitamins, 2,4-D 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES) buffer (0.5 g/L), 0.8% agar (8 g/L)). The cells were then dispersed evenly across the surface. All plate manipulations were conducted under sterile conditions in a laminar flow hood to assure sterility of both the interior and exterior of plates. Plates were put into a sterile Nalgene™ BioTransport Carrier (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), each layer of plates separated with a sterile non-skid plastic insert. The BioTransporter was then sealed with gas-permeable tape (3M), wrapped in Steri-Wrap™ autoclave wraps (Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA) and then driven to KSC. The BRIC17 CEL experiment was turned over to payload engineers in the SSPF (Space Station Processing Facility) at KSC 48 h before the scheduled launch time. Total RNA was extracted using Qiashredder and RNAeasy™ kits from QIAGEN (QIAGEN Sciences, Germantown, MD, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Residual DNA was removed by performing an on-column digestion using an RNase Free DNase (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany). Integrity of the RNA was evaluated using the Agilent 2100 BioAnalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). cDNA was synthesized using Ovation Pico WTA System (NuGEN Technologies Inc., Redwood City, CA, USA) and labeled using Encore Biotin Module (NuGEN Technologies Inc.,Redwood City, CA, USA). Amplified and labeled cDNA (5 µg/sample) was fragmented and hybridized with rotation onto Affymetrix GeneChip Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Arrays for 16 h at 45 °C. Arrays were washed on a Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) with the Hybridization Wash and Stain Kit (Affymetrix) and the Washing Procedure FS450_0004. Scanning was performed using Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G. For both spaceflight and ground control, 5 plates of WT and 3 plates of HSFA2 KO were analyzed as biological replicates. 4.5.1. Microarray Data Analysis 4.6. Functional Gene Categorization—Gene Ontology Annotations AmiGO—If needed, the GO database was accessed through the AmiGO query tool. ATTED-II—The ATTED-II database of coexpressed genes, developed to identify functionally related genes inArabidopsis, was also used [116]. The make gene function table function was implemented to retrieve organized information on gene function (based on TAIR annotation) and subcellular localization (as predicted by TargetP and WOLF PSORT). gProfiler—A web-based toolset for functional profiling of gene lists was used [117].Arabidopsis thalianawas the selected organism with most of default options except where the Benjamini-Hochberg FDR significance threshold was selected.
