Temperatures above the optimum are sensed as heat stress (HS)1by all living organisms. When exposed to high temperature, plants have sophisticated mechanisms to maintain cellular homeostasis and minimize cell damage. Heat shock transcription factors (HSFs) mediate gene expression changes leading to the production of heat shock proteins (HSPs) that confer thermotolerance to plants (1,2,3). In recent years, there has been considerable progress in identifying the signaling steps that enable plants to respond to heat stress at the molecular level. These include: activation of bZIP transcription factors by heat-induced proteolytic cleavage (4); inhibition of transgene-induced post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) by SUPPRESSOR OF GENE SILENCING 3 (SGS3) (5); accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by RBOHD activation (6); and reduced H2A.Z occupancy in nucleosomes of heat-regulated genes, which would be expected to stimulate transcription of these genes (7). Many reports also provide evidence that membrane-localized calcium channels can act as sensors for increased temperature in plant cells (8,9). The increase in cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca2+]cyt) caused by calcium influx from the extracellular matrix is an early critical step in the HS signal transduction pathway (10). In responding to this calcium influx, calcium-binding proteins such as calmodulin and calcium dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) are activated. Calmodulin binds to a calmodulin-binding protein kinase, which in turn, activates heat-regulated changes in gene expression by phosphorylating HSF (11,12,13). CDPKs, on the other hand, might regulate plant heat-shock responses by activating multiple mitogen-activated protein kinases (14). Despite considerable progress in studying the mechanisms of heat-shock signal transduction, our understanding of the heat signal perception and early signaling transduction mechanism is still very limited. Therefore, identifying novel proteins that regulate early heat-shock responses should help decoding high-temperature sensing and responding mechanismin planta. Along with advances in genome sequencing, new proteomic technologies have now emerged as an important tool in studying signal transduction mechanisms (15). Compared with traditional genetic studies, which rely on phenotypes caused by altering gene activity, proteomics not only provides real-time monitoring of abundance changes of certain proteins during cell and tissue responses to stimuli, but also reveals their mechanisms of function and regulation, such as post-translational modifications and protein–protein interaction. In this study, we used the two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2-D DIGE) technology to find microsome-associated proteins whose level changes rapidly after heat-shock, and identified a set of membrane proteins that change abundance in response to a five-minute heat treatment. Among these proteins was annexin 1 (AtANN1), and here we demonstrate that this protein plays a key role in plant heat-stress responses by mediating a heat-induced increase in [Ca2+]cyt. Plant Materials and Heat Shock Treatment 2D-DIGE Protein Sample Preparation Because we were interested in finding heat shock-regulated proteins whose level changed rapidly, we used a water bath for our heat shock proteomic studies to make sure all the seedlings were instantly subjected to similar temperature at same time. To prepare the seedlings for 2D-DIGE protein sample extraction,Arabidopsisseedlings were grown in liquid medium containing 1/2 MS salt and 1.5% (w/v) sucrose under long day at 22 °C for 1 week. To avoid a nutrient shock effect, half of the old medium was transferred into a new container and incubated at 37 °C in the water bath, whereas the other half of the medium was kept at 22 °C with the seedlings. When the temperature of the water bath medium reached 37 °C, half of the seedlings were transferred into the medium to initiate the heat shock treatment. After heat shock treatment for 5 min, seedlings were harvested by filtering through a nylon mesh, quick tap-dried with tissue paper and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Microsomal proteins were extracted as described previously (16), and dissolved in DIGE buffer (7murea, 2mthiourea, 4% CHAPS) at a concentration around 5–10 μg/μl. 2D-DIGE Procedure and Image Analysis Protein for 2D-DIGE analysis was labeled with CyDyeTMDIGE fluor minimal labeling kit (GE Healthcare). In brief, 10 μl microsomal protein from control or heat treated sample was mixed with 0.25 μl of Tris-HCl (1.5m, pH 8.8) and 0.5 μl of 100 nmCy3 or Cy5, respectively, and incubated in darkness at 4 °C for 2 h. The reaction was terminated by adding 1 μl 10 mmlysine and incubating with the protein on ice for 10 min. The Cy3- and Cy5- labeled pair of control and heat treated samples were combined, and to the mix was added 9 μl of 1mDTT, 4.5 μl of IPG buffer, pH 4–7. One hundred-micrograms of unlabeled protein each from control and heat-treated samples was then added to make the total protein amount in the mixture around 300 μg. The DIGE buffer was used to adjust the final volume to 450 μl for separation by isoelectric focusing (IEF) using 24 cm Immobiline Dry Strips, pH 4–7. Two-dimensional electrophoresis was performed according to (16). DIGE images were acquired using a Typhoon trio scanner (GE healthcare). At least six biological repeats were performed, and labeling of two pairs of biological repeat samples was swapped to avoid identifying proteins that are preferentially labeled by a specific CyDye. Spots that showed consistent heat shock regulated changes in at least five biological repeat samples were picked using a robotic spot picker (GE healthcare). Protein In-gel Digestion and Mass Spectrometry Identification Protein in-gel digestion was performed as described previously (17). Extracted peptides in 0.1% formic acid were separated using a 100 μm ×150 mm C18 reverse phase column (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at a flow rate of 350 nl/min, and eluted using a linear acetonitrile (ACN) gradient (0–45%) with 0.1% formic acid over 60 min using a nano-LC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Eluted peptides were electrosprayed directly into a LTQ-XL linear ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using an uncoated 15 μm inner diameter spraying needle with 2.1 kV electrospray voltage at 220 °C. Peptides were analyzed in positive ion mode with m/z range between 400 and 2000. Charged peaks over 1000 counts were selected for collision induced dissociation (CID) with 35% normalized collision energy and activation Q value was set to 0.25. The dynamic exclusion activation time was set to 30 s to prevent samem/zions from being selected after its acquisition. CID product ions were analyzed on the linear ion trap in centroid mode. Complete LC-MS/MS peak lists were searched against database generated fromArabidopsissubset of the NCBInr database (date 12/12/2012, 257,035 entries searched), using the SEQUEST search algorithm, which is part of the BioWorks 3.3.1 data analysis software (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The peptide mass range was set to 400–5000 amu. The precursor ions' tolerance and fragment ions' tolerance were set to 2.00 amu and 1.00 amu, respectively. Enzymatic digestion was specified as trypsin, with a maximum of two missed cleavages allowed. Cysteine carbamidomethylation was allowed as fixed modifications, and methionine oxidation were allowed as variable modification. Search result option filter was set as the following: Delta CN ≥ 0.1; Xcorr (±1, 2, 3) = 1.75, 2.5, 3.0; peptide probability≤0.01. Isolation of Annexin T-DNA Mutants Plasmid Construction and Transformation Full-length CDS ofAtANN1were amplified by PCR, cloned into pENTR/SD/D-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), and subcloned into Gateway compatible binary vector pEarleyGate 100 by LR clonase (Invitrogen). The construct was introduced intoAgrobacterium tumefaciensstrain GV3101 by electroporation and transformed intoArabidopsis(Col-0 ecotype) by the floral dipping method. Transgenic plants were selected by spraying plants with 5 μg/ml Basta (Finale). All transgenic lines used in this study are single insertional homozygous T3 lines. Expression Analysis of HSFs and HSPs by RT-PCR and Western Blot Wild type andann1–2/ann2double mutant seedlings were grown in the same glass plates containing 15 ml growth medium (1/2 MS salt, 1.5% sucrose, and 0.8% agar) for 1 week at 22 °C under long-day condition. For heat shock treatment, the plates were placed into a growth chamber with temperature set at 37 °C. Seedlings were harvested at different time intervals and frozen in liquid nitrogen. For RT-PCR analysis of the expression level of various HSFs transcript, total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and reverse transcribed into cDNA using ExScriptTMRT reagent kit (Takara) according to manufacturer's instruction. Primer pairs used for RT-PCR analysis were: 5′-atgatgaacccgtttctcccggaag-3′ and 5′-ggaggtggaagccaaactctcatcac-3′ for HSF A7A; 5′-atggaagaactgaaagtggaaat-3′ and 5′-aggttccgaaccaagaaaacccatt-3′ for HSF A2; 5′-atgacggctgtgacggcggcgcaaag-3′ and 5′-gttgcagactttgctgcttttccac-3′ for HSF B1; 5′-acagatttcgctaaagatttgctt-3′ and 5′-cgcttcttcttcttcttcaatctc-3′ for HSF B2A. For protein abundance analysis of HSPs, frozen tissues were ground into fine powder in liquid nitrogen, boiled with 2× SDS sampling buffer, loaded onto SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. Membrane was probed with different antibodies specifically against various HSPs (Agrisera, Vännäs, Sweden) and detected with SuperSignal West Dura Chemiluminescence System (Pierce). Ca2+Measurement Using Aequorin Aequorin luminescence measurement was performed according to (18), with slight modifications. TransgenicArabidopsisseedlings expressing cytosolic35S::Aequorinwere grown in 1/2 MS salt containing medium for 10 days under long day at 22 °C. Seedlings (n ≥ 15 per treatment) were transferred to a 96-well plate and incubated in dark with a calcium-measurement buffer (0.1 mmKCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 10 mmMES, 5 μmcoelenterazine-h) at 22 °C for 6 h. The seedlings were quick rinsed two times with the calcium-measurement buffer, 100 μl 22 °C (control) or 37 °C (heat shock) calcium measurement buffer was quickly added to each well, and the plate was loaded into a microplate luminometer (Centro LB 960, Berthold, Oak Ridge, TN) that is at room temperature (control) or has been prewarmed to 37 °C (heat shock). Aequorin luminescence signal in each well was recorded for 0.5 s every 30 s. After 45 counts, 100 μl reconstitution solution (2mCaCl2, 20% ethanol) was injected and luminescence signal in each well was recorded for 10 more cycles, 0.5 s each. Percentage reconstitution value was calculated by dividing the luminescence signal recorded at each time point by the highest reconstitution luminescence value recorded in each well, respectively, for wild type,ann1andann1/2mutants. Relative aequorin signal is calculated by dividing percentage reconstitution value collected at 37 °C by percentage reconstitution value collected at 22 °C. Determination of Total Ca2+in Plant Tissues Fifty seven-day-oldArabidopsisseedlings grown in 1/2 MS medium supplied with 1% sucrose were grouped as one sample and oven dried at 65 °C overnight. After recording the dry weights, the dried plants were digested with 5 ml HNO3 at 100 °C for 4 h. The digested mixture was transferred to a volumetric flask, and diluted precisely to 100 ml with double distilled water. Total plant Ca2+concentration was determined with a flame atomic absorption spectrophotomer (Model AA-240Z, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). The Effect of HS Temperature and Duration on the Survival of ArabidopsisSeedlings Increased environmental temperature triggers heat-shock responses (HSR) in plants; however, if the temperature rises above a certain limit, or the duration of the high temperature is too long, plants will not be able to survive. To study the HS response of plant cells, the treatment used should be strong enough to stimulate the HSR, but at the same time mild enough not to kill the plant. In order to find a proper heat-shock treatment condition for our proteomic studies, plates containing one-week-oldArabidopsisseedlings were treated at a range of temperatures and treatment durations, and post-treatment survival rates were calculated after the seedlings recovered at 22 °C for 1 week. Treatment ofArabidopsisseedlings in a 42 °C water bath up to 10 min did not induce irreversible damage to seedlings, whereas treatment with a 42 °C water bath for 30 min killed almost all of the seedlings. In comparison, seedlings treated with a 37 °C water bath for 30 min survived (Fig. 1). As 37 °C has been previously shown to induce HSR (9,11,12), a 37 °C water bath was used as our treatment temperature during the following proteomic studies. The effect of heat shock temperature and duration on the survival ofArabidopsisseedlings.One-week-oldArabidopsisseedlings were heat shock treated at different temperatures for the indicated time period and allowed to recover at 22 °C for 7 days before taking pictures for comparison. Identification of Microsomal Proteins Whose Level Changes Rapidly After Heat Shock Heat shock stimulates a rapid increase of the [Ca2+]cyt. This increase can be seen as early as 1 min after heat treatment, and reaches the maximum around 5 mins (11). In order to study the early cellular responses stimulated by HS, we exposed one-week-oldArabidopsisseedlings to 37 °C for 5 mins and harvested them for 2D-DIGE analysis. Protein samples from control and treated seedlings were analyzed in at least six biological-repeat experiments. In average, over 1500 protein spots were detected in each gel (Fig. 2A). Examination of the DIGE images identified over 49 spots that showed consistent abundance changes induced by heat shock. Surprisingly, the abundance of most spots was increased by heat treatment, and only a few showed decreased levels. These spots of interest were picked, digested in gel by trypsin and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. A total of 27 heat-shock-regulated protein spots, which represented 19 unique proteins, were successfully identified (Table I). Functional classification showed these proteins are involved in processes such as hormone biosynthesis, protein translation, calcium signaling, cellular metabolism, and protein folding (chaperone). 2D DIGE analysis of heat-regulated microsomal proteins identified AtANN1 as an early heat-responsive protein.A, Microsomal protein from Col-0 seedlings treated with 37 °C for 5 min was labeled with Cy5, and microsomal protein from untreated seedlings was labeled with Cy3. The proteins were then separated using 24 cm, pH 4–7, IPG strips and a 10% SDS-PAGE gel.B, Three-dimensional view of spot 4191 in imageA, left image represents Cy3 channel and right image represents Cy5 channel.C, Western analysis of AtANN1 protein accumulation after heat shock.

Table I. Early heat-regulated microsomal proteins identified by mass spectrometry. The heat regulated abundance changes were observed from at least five biological repeats. For MS/MS identification, number of unique peptides, sequence coverage of the identified proteins and the best matched scores are listed. Annexin 1 is Essential for Plant Resistance to Heat-Shock Treatment Of all the microsomal proteins identified inTable I, we chose to further study AtANN1 (Fig. 2B), because of prior evidence showing that it could play a major role in mediating plant stress responses. Using polyclonal antibody raised specific against a 31 amino acid sequence from AtANN1 (amino acids 200–231) (19), we confirmed the 2D-DIGE result in which AtANN1 protein levels increased in the microsomal fraction after 5 mins of HS (Fig. 2C). We then isolated Transfer DNA (T-DNA) insertion mutants ofAtANN1gene to investigate ifAtANN1plays a significant role in HS responses inArabidopsis. We obtained three insertion mutants forAtANN1, and these alleles were named asann1–1(SalK_132169),ann1–2(Sail_414_C01), andann1–3(WiscDsLox477–480P11;Fig. 3A). The T-DNA insertion sites in these alleles were located at the 5′ UTR of theAtANN1gene (ann1–1) or within different positions of its second and third exon (ann1–2andann1–3), respectively (Fig. 3A). Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) analysis of these T-DNA mutants showed that the expression ofAtANN1inann1–2andann1–3is not detectable, whereas the expression ofAtANN1inann1–1was not affected (Fig. 3B). We then compared the basal thermotolerance of these T-DNA insertional mutants with wild-type seedlings. One-week-old seedlings were subjected to 45 °C water bath for 13 min, and then allowed to recover at 22 °C for another week before they were photographed and calculate their survival rate. Consistent with the expression of endogenousAtANN1level,ann1–2andann1–3seedlings were hypersensitive to heat-shock treatment, whereas heat sensitivity ofann1–1seedlings was similar to wild-type plants (Fig. 3C,3D).

Error bars represent ±S.D.D, Time-course measurement of aequorin signal in wild type,ann1andann1/2mutants. Seedlings were treated with or without heat shock. Relative aequorin signal is calculated by dividing percentage reconstitution value collected at 37 °C by percentage reconstitution value collected at 22 °C. These experiments have been repeated at least three times, and the trends are similar. Data shown here is from one representative experiment. There are numerous reports documenting AtANN1 functions as a calcium-permeable channel-like protein in response to abiotic stress, but most of the data was obtained from patch clamp experiments of spheroplasts and protoplasts of root epidermal cells (23,24,34). Here, using an aequorin reporting system, we found AtANN1 and AtANN2 play a role in regulating the elevation of [Ca2+]cytinduced by heat shock in whole seedlings. We found that heat-induced change in [Ca2+]cytwas greatly reduced inann1mutant and was even lower inann1–2/ann2double mutant, which suggests that AtANN1 and AtANN2 are important components of the channel transport system that regulates heat-induced increase in [Ca2+]cyt. However, heat shock still induces a small increase in [Ca2+]cytin theann1–2/ann2double mutant, especially in the first 5 min of heat shock treatment, which might be caused by the function of other proteins that facilitate Ca2+uptake, such as CNGCs inArabidopsis. Interestingly, the total calcium concentration inann1andann1/2mutant seedlings is lower than wild-type control seedlings. However, future studies are needed to determine whether the reduced calcium accumulation is caused by the reduced calcium influx inann1andann1/2mutants.
