  "content": "Molecular and physiological changes in the SpaceX Inspiration4 civilian crew Received 2023 Feb 3; Accepted 2024 Jun 3; Issue date 2024. Subject terms:Physiology, Molecular biology, Cognitive neuroscience, Oculomotor system, Visual system SpaceX’s Inspiration4 mission sent an all-civilian crew into orbit to study physiological, neurovestibular and neurocognitive changes in the astronauts and found that short-duration civilian space missions do not pose a major health risk. Here we present findings from the human research experiments performed on SpaceX’s first all-civilian private spaceflight, Inspiration4, which launched from Kennedy Space Center on 15 September 2021, on the SpaceXCrew Dragoncapsule. This orbital class mission reached 590.6 km in altitude; the farthest distance crewed orbital missions have been into space since the Gemini programme. Although the crew spent only 3 days in low Earth orbit, they experienced similar hazards of spaceflight as International Space Station (ISS) missions (often 6–12 months in duration), including radiation exposure, sustained microgravity, the closed and hostile environment of space, isolation and confinement, and long distance from Earth resources2. Thus, the Inspiration4 mission, and similar missions, provide a platform to study these acute exposures endemic to low Earth orbit, with unique data collection opportunities in the earliest phase of the human body’s response to spaceflight. Extended Data Fig. 1. The environmental, physiological, cognitive, imaging, and omics measures collected across Inspiration4 mission phases and their sampling frequency. To assess the effect of short-duration spaceflight on an all-civilian crew, data were collected on myriad domains using various methodologies (colors, left) before, during, and after flight spanning human biometrics, virome, cognition, spacecraft environment, and multi-omics assays. Green circles denote samples collected on Earth (i.e., pre-flight, post-flight) and blue diamonds denote data collected in-flight, along with their respective assays. For the timing of data collection, data collected during the pre-flight period is presented as the number of days prior to launch (L) and data collected in the post-flight period is presented as the number of days following return (R) to Earth. Data with continual collection (e.g. cabin measurements) are shown as bracketed time periods. Multi-omic profiling of the Inspiration4 crew Extended Data Fig. 2.

Created withBioRender.com. Fig. 1. Multi-omic changes across the Inspiration4 mission. Hundreds of thousands of multi-omic measurements were generated across multiple sample types. From DNA, single-nuclei chromatin accessibility, WGS, cell-free DNA (cfDNA) sequencing, telomere length and clonal haematopoiesis were measured. From RNA, whole blood gene expression, whole blood m6A modifications, peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) single-nuclei RNA sequencing, skin spatially resolved gene expression and T cell and B cell immune repertoire profiling were performed. For proteins, plasma proteomics, extracellular vesicles and particles (EVP) proteomics and plasma metabolomics were quantified. Additionally, from microbial skin and environmental (Env.) swabs, bacterial, fungal and viral species were measured. Fig. 2. Virome-wide antibody analysis of blood samples self-collected during short-duration spaceflight. To detect species-specific antibody changes during the sampling period, we conducted a peptide set enrichment analysis19to compare all pairs of consecutive time points for each virus species (Fig.2b). We detected a total ofn= 8 such events (defined as significant reactivity increases); the largest number corresponded to Epstein–Barr virus (n= 4), a virus previously reported to be reactive in astronauts during short-duration spaceflight13,18. The remainder were species associated with common upper respiratory infections:Rhinoviruses AandC(n= 2 andn= 1, respectively) andAdenovirus C(n= 1). The Epstein–Barr virus events included changing reactivity that overlapped with flight for astronauts C001 and C002 during flight (Fig.2b), although these specific viruses were not found in the sequence data (Fig.1). These combined analyses indicate that changing immunity to viruses can be detected during spaceflight, even under conditions where no viral symptoms or replication are detected, which has been previously documented in astronauts during longer missions14. Point-of-care sampling and analysis Extended Data Fig. 3. Paper-based multiplexed microgravity-adapted vertical flow assay (0g-VFI). a, Annotated exploded view of the 0g-VFI.

Extended Data Fig. 4. 0g-Vertical Flow Immunoassay (VFI) analytical performance and quality control metrics. a, 0g-VFI intensity for C-reactive protein (CRP) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) spots are a function of CRP and IgM concentration on multiplex membranes. CRP and IgM samples were assayed from three independent 0g-VFI (n = 3) and each CRP and IgM data point presented is the mean ± SEM of the triplicate. For each CRP and IgM plot, a four-parameter logistic model was used to generate the fitted curve and the limit of detection (LOD), represented as a dotted line, was determined using the following formula:LOD=x¯negC+3σnegC, where LOD is equal to the mean of the negative control (negC) + 3 standard deviations (σ) of the negative control.b, Intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation (CV) across CRP and IgM assays are presented; CVs were calculated by CV (%) = (Standard Deviation/Mean) x 100. For the inter-assay CV, each point represents the CV of the control spots obtained from three independent identical replicates of 7 CRP and IgM 0g-VFI membranes (n = 14). For the intra-assay CV, each point represents the CV of the three control spots obtained within the same membranes from 43 independent CRP and IgM 0g-VFI.c, Representative intensity distribution across 0g-VFI membranes.

Data presented are mean ± SEM from three independent 0g-VFI (n = 3). Ultrasound imaging of the Inspiration4 crew Fig. 3. Imaging-based experiments. The IJV imaging protocol was similar to the protocol described in ref.20, which was designed to measure bilateral IJV cross-sectional areas (CSAs) and flow velocities, and can be used to identify anomalies, such as thrombi, loss of flow spontaneity, flow reversal and spontaneous echo contrast development21,22(Fig.3c). In contrast to long-duration ISS cohorts20,22and regardless of flight day (FD1–3), both IJVs were free from thrombi and flow anomalies in all Inspiration4 astronauts. Spontaneous antegrade flow was demonstrated in all examined IJVs by colour and (or) spectral Doppler and no spontaneous echo contrast was detected. While previous studies of astronauts in both short-duration (less than 7 days) and long-duration spaceflight have demonstrated a stable increase in IJV CSA20,23,24, the absence of flow anomalies and spontaneous echo contrast in all four astronauts suggests a potential difference from respective long-duration spaceflight data and the possibility of lower risk of IJV thrombosis in the early period of microgravity exposure. The effect of inspiratory resistance breathing using an impedance threshold device (ITD) on IJV filling (reflected as CSA) appeared more pronounced on the right side, but varied among astronauts and did not reach statistical significance (Fig.3d,t-test,Pvalues > 0.05). Notably, the measurements were concordant among astronauts pre-flight and in-flight (Fig.3d), indicating reliable data collection and encouraging further inquiries into the potential of ITD-like interventions as a countermeasure against thrombosis in cases of clinical concern with commensurate flow anomalies. Otolith asymmetry and motion sickness Fig. 4. Ocular misalignment before and after short-duration spaceflight. a–d, The response of the neurovestibular system to short-duration spaceflight was indexed by ocular misalignment, as a proximal measure of otolith asymmetry. The degree of vertical ocular misalignment (VAN) is shown for each of then= 4 astronauts as follows: C001 (a), C002* (b), C003 (c), C004* (d). An asterisk denotes astronauts who reported SMS in-flight; in these astronauts (C002 and C004), VAN scores were not significantly different post-flight relative to pre-flight. Each box represents one test session (n= 2 pre-flight andn= 2 post-flight, for each astronaut), in which 11 VAN trials were performed. The horizontal bar in each box represents the median of that dataset, the box encompasses the central 50% of the dataset and the whiskers indicate the minimum and maximum values that are not outliers (outliers, which are more than three scaled median absolute deviations from the median, are indicated by circles). Two-sample two-tailedt-tests were performed for each astronaut individually to determine consistency of pre-flight and post-flight measures, and significant differences (indicating spaceflight adaptation) between pre-flight and post-flight measures. Extended Data Fig. 6. Ocular misalignment before and after short-duration spaceflight. Data as presented in Fig.5. Red boxes indicate the grouping, for each astronaut, of pre-flight and the post-flight tests; an asterisk (*) denotes astronauts who experienced space motion sickness (SMS) in-flight. This shows consistency of pre-flight and post-flight tests in the non-SMS astronauts (C001 and C003). Vertical offsets of the boxes in each graph show change from pre-flight to post-flight, indicative of adaptive change during flight (larger adaptive change associated with lack of SMS). Boxes are drawn manually, to enclose the median in each case. Cardiovascular responses to spaceflight Extended Data Fig. 7.

For panelsgandh, mean ± SEM with thenfor each astronaut during that mission phase. Differences in-flight and post-flight relative to pre-flight were evaluated using mixed-effect models contrasting the in-flight and post-flight periods with pre-flight; post-hoc analyses testing for differences between astronauts were corrected for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate method51. Significant associations are adjusted for multiple comparisons: *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ****P < 0.0001. The Inspiration4 crew’s neurobehavioural functions Extended Data Fig. 9. Profiles of astronaut cognitive performance onCognitionassays across mission phases. Extended Data Fig. 10. Astronaut report of behavioral states across mission phases. Astronauts (N = 4) reported on their sleep duration and behavioral state using the Alertness and Mood Survey (AMS)50. For all 10 AMS items (panelsb-k), astronauts rated their behavioral state using 11-point Likert-type scales for each item during all three phases of the mission (N = 26 for each item). AMS items are plotted on the full range of each scale and higher numbers represent higher ratings in the direction of the item at the bottom of each panel (e.g., for Poor Sleep Quality, a higher number represents worse sleep quality). For all AMS items except sleep quality and workload, astronauts were prompted to rate “how are you feeling right now?”a, Sleep duration (derived from self-reported sleep and wake-up times).b, Sleep quality (question: “How was the quality of your sleep?”; anchors: good—poor).c, High workload (question: “What was today’s workload?”; anchors: very low—very high).d, Sleepiness (anchors: not sleepy at all—very sleepy).e, Physical exhaustion (anchors: energetic—physically exhausted).f, Sickness (anchors: healthy—sick).g, Depressed (anchors: not depressed at all—very depressed).h, Unhappiness (anchors: happy—unhappy).i, Bored (anchors: good—poor).j, Monotonous (anchors: good—poor).k, Stressed (anchors: not stressed at all—very stressed). To understand the effects of short-duration spaceflight on the human body for the all-civilian spaceflight crew, this study performed a suite of experiments and collected a wide range of biospecimens before, during and after a 3-day orbital mission. This multidimensional battery included blood, stool, urine, biopsy and saliva samples, ultrasound measurements of the eye, jugular vein and bladder, cognitive and sensorimotor tests, surveys and physiological data collected with an Apple smartwatch. These data showed some of the same signatures of long-duration spaceflight, such as inflammatory response, DNA damage response gene expression (and proteins), telomere elongation and immune signalling changes (Figs.1and2), and demonstrated that such phenotypes can also be observed in the earliest phases of spaceflight and across a shorter mission time frame. Moreover, this mission also enabled new biomedical metrics for spaceflight, such as RNA methylation, single-nucleus chromatin, single-cell expression metrics and spatial transcriptomics. Overall, this work demonstrated that a diverse civilian crew can conduct scientific experiments, process samples and significantly contribute to spaceflight research with minimal risk. Although two astronauts presented with SMS, most metrics (for example, IJV size, heart rate, complete blood count metrics, gene expression and cytokines) were either stable or quickly reverted to pre-flight levels (baseline) after landing on Earth. The development of diagnostic, point-of-care devices that can detect and quantify multiple biomarkers is critical to monitor astronauts’ healthcare for future spaceflight missions and to help guide medical interventions. This mission showed that a VFI can be used to detect antigens and, more generally, protein markers37–39. Due to flight certification constraints required for all technologies used in spaceflight, the desiccant usually placed in the packaging kit to avoid high humidity exposure during long-term storage had to be removed, and has been identified as the main cause for the alteration of the assay efficiency in-flight. For future missions, reagent and system stability studies will have to determine optimal storage conditions without the use of hygroscopic compounds. Despite this obstacle, the 0g-VFI demonstrated its robustness of operation in space, and the simplicity of its user interface allowed for its use by untrained non-scientists, supporting the feasibility of such point-of-care diagnostic systems for several applications on additional specimen types, including for deep-space missions. The Inspiration4 mission undertook ultrasound imaging-based human research in full crew autonomy, with minimal pre-flight familiarization and reliance on experiment-specific just-in-time (JIT) instruction. Probing the potential limitations of miniaturized ultrasound technology combined with the rapid deployment and complete crew autonomy was an inseparable part of the experiment. This autonomy is in stark contrast to the ISS experience, where all imaging sessions are conducted with a traditional device and in real-time interaction with experts in the mission control centre. The anatomical and technical quality of the images, expressed as overall success scores, appeared inversely related to the complexity of the autonomous procedures. Bladder imaging (the simplest procedure) and IJV imaging (intermediate difficulty and complexity) each had similar scores, well above the usability threshold. Conversely, the ocular imaging procedure (most intricate), which required precise gaze control and accurate probe manipulation by real-time visual feedback, did not produce image sets of sufficient quality to derive the intended measures, such as globe axial length or optic nerve sheath diameter. In this study, all but the most intricate procedures could be successfully performed by minimally trained users with the aid of appropriate JIT materials. Based on these findings, as well as those acquired during similar applications on the ISS, ocular imaging with JIT instruction in future missions should involve a dedicated ultrasound operator; however, other exams can be reliably performed in self-scanning, autonomous mode, which represents a significant medical and research capability in situations with degraded communications (for example, high latency, loss of communication). Payloads consisting of a miniaturized imaging system with an intuitive interface can enable future experiments featuring short lead and training times, rapid deployment, flexible schedules and data collection autonomy, which will enable scientific research opportunities even on the most constrained of spaceflight missions. Consistent with studies of astronauts and cosmonauts completing both short- and long-duration spaceflight missions34–36, collecting objective measures of astronaut cardiovascular functions and neurocognitive functioning, as well as subjective measures of sleep and astronaut behavioural states, is feasible in commercial astronaut crews throughout short-duration orbital missions. The Inspiration4 crew provided valid and usable data on cardiovascular physiology, cognitive performance and behavioural states across mission phases that can translate to the general public3,42, which is important as trained astronauts from international space agencies are not necessarily representative of the average individual. The effects of short-duration spaceflight on Inspiration4 crew cardiovascular physiology and cognitive performance were modest, although there was substantial interindividual variability in the response to spaceflight, as previously observed34,43,44. Studies of cognitive performance have generally found that astronauts maintain relatively high levels of performance in spaceflight, although this may be a function of the duration of spaceflight missions, where performance decrements manifest with longer mission durations1,34. In this study, accuracy on eight of the ten (80%) cognition tests was unaffected by short-duration spaceflight (Fig.5). There was, however, more variability in astronaut response speed on neurocognitive tasks, where slower response speeds were observed on four cognition tests, a finding consistent with earlier reports of astronaut response slowing during short-duration spaceflight (that is, less than or equal to 10 days in spaceflight shuttle missions)45,46. Although previous studies have not found large cognitive performance deficits in spaceflight, this may be due to the timing of neurocognitive testing, which often does not occur on the first day in-flight, but up to four days in-flight, at which point cognitive deficits may have dissipated. Furthermore, the observed changes in response speed may, to some extent, be associated with neurovestibular and sensorimotor alterations induced by spaceflight26,47. While astronaut sleep durations less than 6 h on the ISS have been associated with psychomotor slowing, Inspiration4 astronauts averaged 6.7 h of sleep per night in-flight and thus the contribution of sleep loss to slower response speeds would be modest if present36. Astronauts did not report overtly negative behavioural states in-flight (for example, depression, stress), but they reported more happiness and less boredom post-flight relative to pre-flight (Fig.5). Significantly, all data from this study are stored in multiple controlled-access repositories for easy access, including TrialX, NASA’s Open Science Data Repository and GeneLab, the SOMA data portal and the Commercial Spaceflight Data Repository, which facilitates the collection of mission-specific research, medical data and biospecimens to be stored in a permanent electronic data and tissue repository for future scientific research. These data also include qualitative survey data received via mobile apps, DICOM-standard images from portable ultrasound devices, data from wearables (for example, heart rate, electrocardiogram), biospecimen information, cell processing details48and the environmental/mission data from theCrew Dragoncapsule (for example, cabin pressure, temperature and humidity, spacecraft telemetry), which can help guide exploration-class future missions49. Finally, the repository contains a visualization dashboard for researchers to view summary analytics and access individual observations and data files, which has been added to TRISH’s enhancing exploration platforms and analogue definition programme. Finally, it is worth noting that the Inspiration4 mission was not designed to address how the biological and behavioural responses of the Inspiration4 crew relate to those of professional astronauts or cosmonauts, or those with career-long exposure to spaceflight. Furthermore, the research on the Inspiration4 mission was not designed to determine the safety of spaceflight for all civilians, or to recommend spaceflight for future civilian passengers; the Inspiration4 research projects were also not tasked with making judgements for future crew selection or fitness for spaceflight. The selection of astronauts for spaceflight is exclusive to international space agencies (governmental or commercial). Nonetheless, the Inspiration4 data, along with data from other civilian spaceflight missions, may contribute to the development of reference ranges and pre-flight preparatory tasks (for example, behavioural testing in confined environments) that can help guide future crew selection and mission planning. Datasets generated for multi-omics profiling span nine different biospecimen sample types: whole blood, serum, plasma, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), extracellular vesicles and particles, dried blood spots, skin biopsies, skin swabs and capsule swabs. These samples were subject to a spectrum of multi-omic assays, including WGS, clonal haematopoiesis, direct RNA sequencing, single-nuclei RNA sequencing, single-nuclei ATAC-seq, single-cell B cell repertoire and T cell repertoire V(D)J sequencing, proteomics, metabolomics, cell-free DNA sequencing, metagenomics and metatranscriptomics. Additional biomarkers were quantified using a CLIA lab for complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel and cytokine panel. These data types were generated across ten time points in total: three pre-flight (L − 92, L − 44, L − 3), three in-flight (FD1, FD2, FD3), one post-flight (R + 1) and three recovery (R + 45, R + 82, R + 194). Multi-omic feature counts describe the datasets published in refs.4,5. Transcripts detected in whole blood RNA sequencing were assembled using StringTie52. m6A modifications were quantified using m6Anet53with a probability threshold of 0.9. Genes detected from skin biopsy had a count of at least five from the normalized count matrix from the NanoString GeoMx NGS DnD Pipeline. The number of ATAC-seq peaks and genes detected from the single-nuclei data was quantified using the cellranger-arc (v2.0.0) count algorithm from 10x Genomics. We followed the 10x single-cell multi-ome analysis pipeline as previously reported48and adapted for this data as described here. Shotgun metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing reads were deduplicated, filtered for human sequences via alignment to the human reference genome (Hg38) and trimmed for adaptor contamination. Fungal, viral and bacterial taxonomic composition was computed via masked read alignment to a database containing all complete genomes in RefSeq using kraken2 (confidence = 0.2)54. For assembly-based approaches, quality-controlled (unmasked) reads were assembled with MetaSPAdes55. Bins were generated with MetaBAT2 (ref.56), and Open-Reading-Frames were identified with bakta57and clustered into a non-redundant gene catalogue with mmseqs2 (ref.58). Assembled viral genomes were identified among contigs with CheckV59. Additional details can be found in ref.10. Highly multiplexed, epitope-resolved IgG reactivity analysis across the human virome was performed on reconstituted dried blood samples using DNA-barcoded peptide (PepSeq) assays. The HV2 library has been previously described15and consists of 15,000 30mer peptides covering 80 viral species and selected based on earlier evidence of reactivity in other cohorts. PepSeq libraries were synthesized and used to profile IgG binding, as previously described16,17. Briefly, DNA-barcoded peptide libraries were generated using bulk in vitro enzymatic reactions, starting with the PCR amplification of oligonucleotide templates and their transcription to generate mRNA. The product was ligated to a hairpin oligonucleotide adaptor bearing a puromycin molecule tethered by a polyethylene glycol spacer and used as a template in an in vitro translation reaction. Finally, a reverse transcription reaction, primed by the adaptor hairpin, was used to generate cDNA, and the original mRNA was removed using RNAse. To perform serological assays, 0.1 pmol of the resulting DNA-barcoded peptide library (5 μl) was added to 5 μl of neat, reconstituted blood spot solution and incubated overnight. The binding reaction was applied to prewashed protein G-bearing beads, washed, eluted and indexed using barcoded DNA oligos. Following PCR cleanup, products were pooled, quantified and sequenced using an Illumina NextSeq instrument yielding a depth of more than 900,000 reads per sample. 0g-VFI membranes were fabricated using nitrocellulose membrane sheets (9 × 8 cm), which were prepared into target membranes on a bench-top CO2laser cutter at 1% power, 100% speed and 3 mm depth. These target membranes have circular discs (6 mm diameter) cut into them in a 6 × 5 design with fiducial markers for targeting the dispensing locations during microarray printing. Control antibody reagent (mouse IgG), rabbit anti-human CRP (11250-R106, SinoBiological) and goat anti-human IgM (109-005-129, Jackson ImmunoResearch) capture antibodies were diluted to working concentrations (0.5 mg ml−1) using filtered 1× PBS. In a clean-room environment, a Nano-Plotter NP2.1 was used for non-contact piezoelectric microarray dispensing of capture antibodies onto the circular discs of a target nitrocellulose membrane (0.2 µm pore size). To prevent evaporation of reagents during printing, an ambient humidity of 55% was maintained using a humidifier. The nozzle hydrostatic pressure was set with the water level of the pressure compensation vessel at the pipette tip height. Spot-front-end software was utilized to co-ordinate a spotting plan for use in the Nano-Plotter Controller software (NPC16) to dispense a nine-spot pattern (350 µm period) of the antibody microarray onto the centre of each circular disc. A 384-well microplate was used to aspirate the antibodies during dispensing. The test reagents were dispensed in 20 droplets per spot at their respective working concentrations at the top two rows (three spots per row for each reagent) of the nine-spot pattern. Ten droplets of the control reagent were dispensed at the bottom three spots of the nine-spot pattern. The immunoassay membranes were then stored in aluminium pouches with silica bead desiccant for later use. Preparation of conjugation pad Conjugate pads were fabricated using polyester fibre with binder (Grade 6614, Ahlstrom Munksjo), which were cut into circular discs (10.5 mm) on a bench-top CO2laser cutter. Gold nanoparticles conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (kindly provided by Dr AuCoin at the University of Nevada-Reno) were incubated with mouse anti-human CRP (11250-R106, SinoBiological) and IgM (MA5-14729, ThermoFisher) for 10 min. The conjugate mix was then dispensed and dried on the conjugate pads at 25 °C for 2 h. Assembly of vertical flow apparatus The 0g-VFI consists of a stacked multilayer of pads and membranes assembled in 3D-printed plastic caps and capsules (Extended Data Fig.3a). The sandwich immunoassay on the 0g-VFI is performed at the multiplexed sensing nitrocellulose membrane, which contains the nine immunoreaction spots. Above the 0g-VFI membrane are functional paper layers, which decrease flow surface area to achieve uniform vertical flow (flow-directing pad), decrease flow rate to increase intensity (retarding pad), generate the assay colour (conjugation pad) and collect plasma samples (sample pad). These layers are all contained in a 3D-printed pad holder, placed in a membrane housing that allows contact between the 0g-VFI membrane and cotton absorbing pads. The user-friendly device also contains capsules within which are wet pads (assay or washing buffer) that trigger fluid transfer once screwed to the membrane housing and placed in contact with the absorbing pads. In total, the 0g-VFI contains four modules consisting of the membrane housing protected with a cap, assay buffer capsule, washing buffer capsule and magnifier cap, all of which fit in small zip bags (Extended Data Fig.3b). Overall, the assay takes up to 20 min due to its simple assembly sequence using the screw cap and reservoir design of the 0g-VFI platform (Extended Data Fig.3c). A user manual and instruction video were made to detail the workflow procedure to SpaceX personnel and Inspiration4 crew. The user manual was integrated in the 0g-VFI kit and was thus available in-flight. The Inspiration4 crew were trained by SpaceX personnel and were instructed to work in pairs for sample collection and to self-perform the 0g-VFI procedure. All imaging was performed with a Butterfly iQ+ handheld ultrasound system (Butterfly Network) with the Butterfly mobile app running on iPhone12 (Apple, Inc.). The device was used in approved preset modes for each procedure (ophthalmic, vascular and bladder). Eighty-nine imaging instances (multiframe cine of varied length) were collected pre-flight and 108 (7.68 GB) images were collected in-flight. All in-flight data (27 instances per astronaut on average; range = 18–32) were stored on the local device (iPhone 12) until secure transfer to a DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) server upon return to Earth. Image analysis was performed in Osirix MD DICOM software (Pixmeo). Of then= 106 in-flight imaging instances analysed,n= 73 were related to IJV,n= 14 to urinary bladder andn= 19 were ophthalmic. All astronauts were self-scanning operators. All pre-flight crew interactions (experiment briefing, familiarization and training, and baseline data collection) were conducted by SpaceX personnel using limited time allocations. Using a previously untested approach to experiment execution, the investigative team relied on experiment-specific JIT instructions to communicate both conceptual and procedural information to SpaceX personnel (for baseline data collection and familiarization) and to the Inspiration4 crew (for autonomous in-flight data collection). In-flight imaging data were obtained via self-scanning and used potable water as a coupling medium in lieu of ultrasound gel. Bladder scans were collected both pre- and post-void, whenever possible. IJV scans were performed with and without inspiratory resistance generated by an ITD (ResQGARD ITD7, Zoll). Given the risks to data quality posed by limitations of imaging expertise, and to evaluate the effectiveness of the JIT tools, a formalized data quality assessment was conducted in the initial phase of data analysis. This included the scoring of each imaging instance for anatomical accuracy and technical quality on a scale of 0–3 (0 = no useful information, 3 = clinical quality). Anatomical accuracy criteria included whether the target was clearly and contiguously visible, along with essential anatomical landmarks; technical quality criteria included elements such as image clarity, gain, acoustical interference, artefact and shadowing. An overall success score was derived as the mean of these two scores, with a usability threshold set at 2.0. This quality filter served to reject anatomically inaccurate or technically flawed images. To determine whether the success of imaging instances varied by anatomical target, a one-way ANOVA tested for in-flight differences in imaging success scores among anatomical targets (that is, bladder, IJV and eye); post hoc pairwise comparisons between anatomical targets were conducted via Tukey’s honest significant difference. To evaluate the effect of impedance breathing on IJV CSA, a series of paired, two-tailed Student’st-tests were conducted; differences between normal and impedance breathing were evaluated by averaging IJV CSA for each condition within each mission phase (that is, pre-flight and in-flight). The otolith organs of the vestibular system transduce linear acceleration and gravity. The sense organs consist of a mass of calcium carbonate crystals (otoconia) that overlie a membrane that is innervated with hair cells. Motion of the crystals relative to the hair cells bends the hair cells, and this bending modifies their firing rates and so provides information on linear acceleration to the central vestibular system. While generally symmetric, there is reason to believe that there are slight asymmetries between the otolith organs on the two sides of the head, in otoconial mass or synaptic sensitivity. This asymmetry is compensated by central neural processes27, but this compensation becomes inappropriate in gravity fields other than 1g, leading to changes in vertical and torsional ocular alignment61,62. In particular, the magnitude of torsional misalignment in alteredglevels has been associated with susceptibility to SMS40,41,63.G-dependent changes in vertical alignment have also been demonstrated in parabolic flight and laboratory studies62,64. Data on SMS in-flight were obtained via self-report. A perceptual-nulling technique was used to measure misalignment between the eyes (skew) in both vertical and torsional directions65. For these tests, the subject views a red line and a blue line on the touchscreen of a tablet computer, through colour-matched red and blue filters, one over each eye. This provides independent images to each eye. Since the test is performed in darkness, there is no visual information that is seen by both eyes together, and hence there are no visual cues to align the eyes (which would fuse the images on the two retinas). One line remains fixed on the screen, while the other line is positioned by the subject, either vertically or torsionally. The subject’s goal is to adjust one line until it appears to be aligned with the other, stationary, line (that is, to null any apparent vertical or rotational offset between the lines). The final amount by which the lines are separated from one another vertically or rotated relative to one another provides a measure of vertical or torsional ocular misalignment, respectively, which produces measures of VAN and TAN. Astronauts completed VAN and TAN measures twice pre-flight and twice post-flight, where each session consisted of 11 VAN and 11 TAN trials. There was no in-flight testing. The Apple Watch Series 6 was used to objectively measure cardiovascular function, which was indexed by blood oxygen saturation levels, heart rate and HRV, as well as activity and energy consumption. The Apple Watch also measured sound pressure levels. The crew donned the Apple Watch for selected periods in all three phases of the mission, including pre-flight, in-flight and post-flight (Extended Data Fig.1). The crew donned the Apple Watch from L − 22 to L − 20 and had an average wear time of 2.7 ± 0.3 (s.d.) days (range = 2.4–3.0 days), in-flight from FD2 to FD3 with an average wear time of 1.2 ± 0.1 (s.d.) days (range = 1.2–1.4 days) and post-flight from R + 0 to R + 10 with an average wear time of 5.8 ± 3.4 (s.d.) days (range = 2.2–9.1 days). Before performing each cognition test battery, astronauts reported on their behavioural state using the AMS50via the Qualtrics application on the Apple iPad Mini Series 4. Developed for astronauts, the 18-item AMS measures behavioural responses to the challenges of both long- and short-duration spaceflight. Fourteen of the 18 AMS items were surveyed in the Inspiration4 crew to reduce time burden, and the four items that were removed had significant overlap with other AMS items. Ten AMS items (monotony, boredom, depression, stress, physical exhaustion, sickness, unhappiness, sleepiness, workload and sleep quality) prompted astronauts to rate each item using 11-point Likert scales (range = 0–10). The remaining AMS items assessed astronaut sleep timing and duration, crew conflict and medication use (stimulant/depressant).
