The demands of deep space pose a health risk to the central nervous system that has long been a concern when sending humans to space. While little is known about how spaceflight affects transcription spatially in the brain, a greater understanding of this process has the potential to aid strategies that mitigate the effects of spaceflight on the brain. Therefore, we performed GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling of mouse brains subjected to either spaceflight or grounded controls. Four brain regions were selected: Cortex, Frontal Cortex, Corunu Ammonis I, and Dentate Gyrus. Antioxidants have emerged as a potential means of attenuating the effects of spaceflight, so we treated a subset of the mice with a superoxide dismutase mimic, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP 5+ (BuOE). Our analysis revealed hundreds of differentially expressed genes due to spaceflight in each of the four brain regions. Both common and region-specific transcriptomic responses were observed. Metabolic pathways and pathways sensitive to oxidative stress were enriched in the four brain regions due to spaceflight. These findings enhance our understanding of brain regional variation in susceptibility to spaceflight conditions. BuOE reduced the transcriptomic effects of spaceflight at a large number of genes, suggesting that this compound may attenuate oxidative stress-induced brain damage caused by the spaceflight environment. Radiation exposure and other stressors experienced during extended deep-space missions have the potential to compromise the function of many bodily systems [1,2,3]. The health risks of spaceflight-induced damage related to the central nervous system (CNS), such as cognitive impairment and neurodegenerative effects, have long been a concern. Animal studies have shown that memory, cognition, motor activity, and other neural functions can be affected under stressful conditions that include both radiation exposure and the spaceflight environment [4,5,6,7,8]. Normal brain function relies on a diverse set of differentiated cell types, including neurons, glia, and vasculature in different regions. There have been, however, relatively few studies on the effects of spaceflight stress on specific brain regions. One study found that spaceflight conditions induced distinct protein expression changes in different regions of the mouse brain [9]. Regional differences were also documented following simulated microgravity in human brain gray and white matter [10]. Our previous flight study [11] demonstrated that exposure to the spaceflight environment induces significant changes in protein expression related to neuronal structure and metabolic function, and there were distinct changes in protein expression in grey versus white matter. One brain region that is of immense interest in the context of spaceflight is the cortex (CT). It plays a key role in sensory and motor function and is closely associated with locomotion, learning, memory, and coordination [12]. Spaceflight and ground simulation studies have given evidence that microgravity conditions negatively affect sensorimotor and behavioral performance, and the functional architecture of the human brain [13,14,15,16], all of which are associated with cortical activity. These significant neurochemical changes were also observed in the rat prefrontal cortex by heavy charged particle irradiation [17]. The frontal cortex (FCT) plays a role in memory, attention, judgment, consciousness, and behavior [18]. Pathophysiological changes in the FCT are associated with depression and anxiety [19]. Another brain region that is critical to understand in the context of spaceflight is the hippocampus, a complex brain structure embedded deep in the temporal lobe. It plays a major role in learning and memory [20]. Ground-based analog studies have found that simulated microgravity influences cognitive function, with increased anxiety and depression-like behaviors that were associated with hippocampal activities [21]. In addition, significantly altered expression of many proteins that relate to metabolism and structure in the hippocampus has been observed to occur under simulated microgravity [22,23]. Space radiation studies have revealed cognitive detriment and changes in morphology in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) and Cornu Ammonis 1 (CA) regions following oxygen-particle irradiation [24]. The DG is located in the deep region of the hippocampus and has been shown to play an important role in pattern separation and associative memory [25]. The CA contains pyramidal cells with a vast network of interneurons; its function is related to memory and consciousness [25]. Spaceflight conditions are associated with oxidative stress [26], which contributes to cellular damage in a variety of tissues. MnTnBuOE-2-PyP5+(BuOE), a manganese porphyrin superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimic, also termed BMX-001, is remarkably beneficial in many animal models of oxidative stress injury [27]. One study demonstrated that BuOE can reduce oxidative stress damage to the brain caused by radiation exposure [28]. Our recent study [29] showed that BuOE treatment during spaceflight significantly reduces the immunoreactivity of the oxidative stress biomarker 4-hydroxynonena (4-HNE) in the retina. This suggests that BuOE is effective in alleviating stress responses to spaceflight [29]. Our present study will test whether BuOE treatment during spaceflight can attenuate spaceflight-induced alterations in gene transcription in specific brain regions. Despite broad interest in understanding region-specific stress responses, characterizing these changes has been a challenge. More recently, spatial transcriptomics technology has been developed, which allows us to simultaneously quantify gene expression levels and their spatial distribution within tissue sections. This method can help to better understand biological responses as well as disease development [30,31]. In this study, we took advantage of this technology by using the Nanostring GeoMx®digital spatial profiling (DSP) platform [32] to investigate spaceflight-induced changes in gene expression profiles in mouse CT, FCT, and hippocampal DG and CA regions, both with and without BuOE treatment. Our unique spatial sequencing data may, for the first time, provide insights into the organization and response of specific brain regions to the spaceflight environment, potentially improving risk assessment of long-term space travel. 2.1.

Genes are ordered by hierarchical clustering. GC vs. FLT (SAL) = GC-SAL versus FLT-SAL; SAL vs. BuOE (FLT) = FLT-SAL versus FLT-BuOE. To obtain insights into the biological processes being affected in the brain by spaceflight, we performed pathway analyses on the spaceflight-induced DEGs. Interestingly, several pathways known to be altered by oxidative stress were significantly enriched in the four brain regions due to spaceflight: VEGF signaling [41] in CA, calcium signaling [42] in DG, FoxO signaling [43] in FCT, and ECM-receptor interaction [44] in CT. In addition, a number of metabolic pathways were among the most significantly enriched, consistent with numerous studies that have found alterations in metabolism and its regulation due to spaceflight-induced neuroendocrine and psychophysiological changes [45]. For example, a mouse study revealed an accumulation of lipids in the liver after spaceflight [46]. Studies also show that space stressors induce metabolic changes in mouse plasma and in the expression of metabolism-related genes [47]. Longitudinal metabolomic profiles revealed sex-specific perturbations in glucose and amino acid metabolism that result from the stressors of long-duration spaceflight [48]; therefore, follow-up studies on sexually dimorphic transcriptional responses to spaceflight in the brain may be warranted. Our findings will help to improve the understanding of regional variation or sensitivities in susceptibility to brain injury and neurodegenerative diseases that exist during spaceflight. In addition, our findings may provide novel insight into cellular mechanisms and operational risks that underlie the effects of spaceflight-mediated structural and functional damage to different brain regions. In future studies, the regulatory mechanism for regional differences in stress response should be further explored in terms of variations of cell types, vasculature, neurotransmitter profiles, hemodynamics, and metabolism. Studies have shown a spaceflight-induced increase in the production of lipid peroxidation products and a decrease in antioxidant enzyme activity [26]. It has been suggested that in stressful environments, antioxidant expression of SOD and catalase are reduced to conserve energy [56]. BuOE, a recently developed antioxidant compound, is among the most highly potent metalloporphyrins that have been evaluated for safety and efficacy [57]. Many animal studies have demonstrated that BuOE is highly effective in mitigating oxidative stress induced by radiation exposure [58]. We therefore treated a subset of our mice with BuOE in order to test its ability to attenuate spaceflight-induced changes in transcription in the CA, DG, FCT, and CT. Treatment with BuOE reversed spaceflight-induced changes in transcription of a substantial number of DEGs, and a statistically significant number of spaceflight-induced DEGs changed in the opposite direction as did BuOE-induced DEGs, suggesting that BuOE may be effective in attenuating at least some of the effects of spaceflight stress on the brain. 4.1. Spaceflight and Mouse Groups Ten-week-old C57BL/6 male mice were launched at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) and spent 35 days aboard the International Space Station (ISS). All mice were maintained at an ambient temperature of 26–28 °C with a 12-h light/dark cycle during the flight. All mice were provided NASA Nutrient-upgraded Rodent Food Bar (NuRFB) and autoclaved deionized water ad libitum. MnTnBuOE-2-PyP5+ (BuOE) at 1 mg/kg (0.2 mL) was administrated subcutaneously 7 days prior to the flight launch and weekly aboard the ISS. All mice were subdivided into saline or BuOE-treated groups. Upon return to the Earth, spaceflight mice were transported to the research laboratory at Roskamp Institute, Sarasota, Florida, within 20 h of splashdown. Mice were exsanguinated by closed-cardiac blood collection under deep Ketamine/Xylazine (150/45 mg/kg) anesthesia, followed by cervical dislocation as a secondary euthanasia method to ensure death. Ground control mice were maintained on Earth for 35 days in flight hardware cages under similar environmental conditions as the flight groups, including the same food, light/dark, temperature, treatment (SAL or BuOE), and euthanasia regimens. The protocol for GC mice commenced three days subsequent to the commencement of the protocol for spaceflight mice. After sacrifice, mouse brains were then removed and prepared as follows. The left hemibrains were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 24 h and then rinsed and washed with PBS for immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays or spatial genomics profiling. The right brains were flash-frozen and stored at −80 °C for further analysis. The study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Loma Linda University (LLU), Roskamp Institute, and The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). After ROI selection, UV light was directed by the GeoMx (https://nanostring.com/products/geomx-digital-spatial-profiler/, accessed on 3 February 2022, NanoString Technologies, Inc., Seattle, WA, USA) device at each area of illumination (AOI), releasing the RNA-ID containing oligonucleotide tags from the WTA probes for collection into a unique well for each AOI. For library preparation, Illumina i5 and i7 dual indexing primers were added to the oligonucleotide tags during PCR to uniquely index each AOI. AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN, USA) were used for PCR purification. Library concentration was measured using a Qubit fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), and quality was assessed using a Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA). Sequencing was performed on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Raw .fastq files were processed into gene count data for each AOI using the GeoMx®NGS Pipeline via Amazon Web Services. All subsequent data analysis described in this subsection was performed using the online GeoMx DSP analysis platform [61], GeoMx DSP Control Center version 3.0.0.111. Raw reads were trimmed, stitched, aligned, and finally deduplicated using default parameters. Using Q3 normalized read count data, a differential expression analysis of FLT-SAL versus GC-SAL, and FLT-BuOE versus FLT-GC, was performed for each brain region independently. Statistical significance of differential expression was measured byt-test (non-paired), and permutation q-values (p-adjusted) were calculated. Genes with q < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 0.585 were considered differentially expressed and used for downstream analysis. 4.4. Association of DEG’s with Neurological Disease A list of genes with known associations to human neurological diseases was obtained using the DisGeNET [62] browse feature with the filters “Disease class: Mental disorders” and “Semantic type: disease or syndrome”. Only genes from curated databases were used. The online tool Enrichr [63,64,65] was used to perform pathway mapping for GC-SAL vs. FLT-SAL DEGs from each region independently. Enriched pathways in this paper are from the KEGG [65] 2019 Mouse pathway analysis in the “legacy” tab of the Enrichr website. 4.6. Principal Component Analysis Q3 normalized read counts output by the online GeoMx DSP analysis platform, as described above, were used as inputs for the PCA. The analysis was done in R version 4.0.3. The R function aov() [66] was used to perform a linear analysis of variance (ANOVA) at each gene, using each biological sample as a factor. The R function qvalue() [67] was then used to calculate ANOVA q-values for all genes, based on thep-values output by aov. Significant genes from the ANOVA (q < 0.05) were then input into the R function PCA() [68] in order to generate PCA plots. 4.7. Statistical Comparison of Spaceflight-Induced and BuOE-Induced DEG Overlaps For a given brain region, let N = total # of spaceflight-induced DEGs (GC-SAL vs. FLT-SAL) plus total # of BuOE-induced DEGs (FLT-SAL vs. FLT-BuOE) for that region. For each brain region, a 2 × 2 contingency matrix, was constructed, where X11= # of spaceflight-induced DEGs changing in the opposite direction as BuOE-induced DEGs, X12= N − X11, X21= # of spaceflight-induced DEGs changing in the same direction as BuOE-induced DEGs, X22= N − X21. Fisher’s exact test was then calculated on each 2 × 2 contingency matrix in order to obtain ap-value for the null hypothesis that the proportion of overlapping DEGs changing in the opposite direction was the same as the proportion of overlapping DEGs changing in the same direction. 4.8. Permutation Testing of Spaceflight-Induced and BuOE-Induced DEG Overlaps For each brain region, a random set of BuOE-induced DEGs was selected as follows. The total set of gene symbols analyzed was shuffled using the “shuf” command in Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS. The top Nupgenes in the shuffled file were selected as the upregulated, BuOE-induced DEGs, where Nup= total # of actual upregulated, BuOE-induced DEGs (FLT-SAL vs. FLT-BuOE) for the brain region. Similarly, the bottom Ndowngenes in the shuffled file were selected as the downregulated, BuOE-induced DEGs, where Ndown= total # of actual downregulated, BuOE-induced DEGs in the brain region. The randomly selected DEGs were then compared with the actual spaceflight-induced DEGs (GC-SAL vs. FLT-SAL) to determine how many changed in opposite directions. This shuffling procedure was repeated 1000 times for each brain region. Sungshin Choi contributed significantly to the success of our study and we greatly appreciate their support.
