Subject terms:Infection, Innate immunity, Microbiology As space exploration extends beyond low Earth orbit, there is considerable interest in understanding the changes in human physiology under spaceflight conditions. Spaceflight includes not only long-term exposure to microgravity, but also radiation, isolation, and short-term exposure to hypergravity. Previous studies have demonstrated that these stressors have a significant impact on the ability of the immune system to respond appropriately to disease, including altered cytokine production,1–5changes in immune cell proliferation and distribution4,6,7and general alteration of immune homeostasis in both innate and adaptive immune systems.8,9 This apparent immune dysregulation is even more important when considering that there have been studies demonstrating significant effects of microgravity and spaceflight conditions on the pathogens that co-occur with humans in space habitats.10–17Opportunistic pathogenic bacteria, such as those that can cause persistent infections in immunocompromised individuals, have been shown to have increased growth in spaceflight,18,19increased antibiotic resistance, and increased virulence.20,21 The human opportunistic bacteriaSerratia marcescenshas only recently emerged as a model for studying rapid shifts in virulence and antibiotic resistance due to increased nosocomial reports.30,31Furthermore,S. marcescenshas been found aboard the spacecraft Mir, and in condensed water aboard the International Space Station (ISS),32,33suggesting that this ubiquitous pathogen should be monitored closely for spaceflight-induced changes that may pose a threat to immunocompromised astronauts who could be more susceptible to opportunistic pathogens.D. melanogasterhas been recently used as a model for studyingS. marcescens, as there are bacterial strains that have been isolated from wild-caught flies that are pathogenic.34–38Importantly, the specific strains used in this study are not pathogenic to humans,34making this system an ideal model for safely studying spaceflight-induced changes toS. marcescensusing a model system.

There was no significant difference in survival ofw1118flies after injection with first subcultures, nor was there significant difference revealed in the assay for in vivo bacterial growth. Error bars represent one standard error. In vivo growth after injection of first ground subculture of spaceflight sample There was no significant difference of in vivo growth of the spaceflight vs ground bacteria within the host (Fig.2b) at hours 0 (F = 13.41,P= 0.146), 9 (F= 0.238,P= 0.866), 12 (F= 0.443,P= 0.731) or 15 (F= 0.479,P= 0.708) hours post-infection. This data was consistent with the fact that there were no differences detected in virulence of the first ground subcultures in the host (Fig.2a). Host survival after injection with LSMMG-treated bacteria Since spaceflight opportunities are relatively infrequent, a model that has often been used on the ground to simulate microgravity conditions for aqueous cultures is the high aspect ratio vessel (HARV) or the RWV.15,17,39We used the RWV apparatus to assess whether we could recreate some or all of the virulence changes that we had measured from the spaceflight samples by simulating the low fluid shear of the microgravity environment on Earth. This is done by rotating the vessel in a perpendicular orientation, where the rotation of the apparatus offsets the sedimental effects of the gravity force and provides continual suspension of the cells. In the control, the axis of rotation is parallel with the gravity force vector and as such, this force is not offset and the cells are allowed to settle.11,13Host survival was significantly lower for hosts infected withS. marcescensthat was grown in LSMMG compared to both the PBS Sham (ratio = 4.42,P< 0.0001) and the RWV Control (Ratio = 3.37,P= 0.0002) (Fig.3a). The RWV Control consists of the same container as is used to simulate microgravity but is rotated about an axis that is oriented at 90 degrees to the LSMMG rotation and is therefore exposed to 1 g Earth’s gravity.11Figure3atherefore shows that we are able to recreate increased virulence inS. marcescensbacteria by simulating microgravity on Earth. This would suggest that the microgravity aspect of the spaceflight environment is at least one important factor to consider in terms of increased virulence inS. marcescens. Fig. 3. Simulated microgravity (SMG) can increase virulence ofS. marcescens. aGraph showing survival ofw1118flies after injection with LSMMG-treated (SMG), RWV control-treated or sham-treated Db11 samples, andbGraph showing in vivo growth of LSMMG-treated (SMG), RWV control or sham-treated Db11 after injection intow1118flies. Error bars represent one standard error. In vivo growth of LSMMGS. marcescens There was no significant difference of in vivo growth between the LSMMG and RWV-Control bacteria at hour 0 (F= 3.551,P= 0.128) or at hour 6 post-infection (F= 7.493,P= 0.0544). However, there was a significant difference in CFU counts per fly between the LSMMG and RWV-Control at hours 9 (F= 20.428,P= 0.008), 12 (F= 12.455,P= 0.019), and 15 (F= 18.427,P= 0.009) post-infection (Fig.3b). These altered growth kinetics also mirror some of the differences observed previously with the spaceflight samples (Fig.1b), where the bacterial samples that show increased virulence, also show increased rates of growth within the host particularly at later time points.

Survival curves ofImdpathway mutant flies,aandb, and ofTollpathway mutant flies,candd, after exposure to either Ground 1 bacteria,aandc, or Space 1 bacteria,bandd. All graphs have data from two wild-type flies (y1w*andw1118) for reference.eVolcano plot of the RNA-seq data from ground-reared wild-typeD. melanogasterthat were infected with space bacteria relative to ground bacteria. RNA was extracted from infected flies 18 h post-infection. Thex-axis represents the beta-value, an estimator of fold change, and the y-axis represents the −log10qvalue, ap-value adjusted for false discovery rate. Red dots represent transcripts withq-value < 0.05, which are considered significantly differentially expressed.fPCA of ground, space, and sham injected flies shows no major difference in distribution of the groups between the conditions, with as much variation occurring within conditions as between conditions. RNA sequencing data analysis of infected ground-reared host At the significance threshold (q-values < 0.05), only eleven transcripts were significantly differentially expressed. However principal components analysis (PCA) comparing transcript abundance across the treatments showed that there is significant overlap among the groups, further indicating that there are few differences between the space bacteria-infected and ground bacteria-infected fruit fly hosts (Fig.4f). It is worth noting that, since the flies collected for RNA-Seq were still alive at 18 h post-injection, this may have biased the selection of flies in which infection had not greatly progressed, as they were still alive at this late time point. Similarity in gene expression across both conditions to a control sham condition shown by PCA supports this idea. In this study, we found that flies infected with a bacterial pathogen that had been grown during spaceflight was significantly more lethal than ground controls (Fig.1). This trend persisted in strains that had been grown in LSMMG conditions, suggesting that microgravity may be the primary factor mediating the differences in virulence seen in the spaceflight bacteria strains (Fig.3). Interestingly, this increased lethality disappears after the first subculture is conducted on the ground, which means that the differences in virulence are short-lived and do not persist after being cultured under normal gravity conditions (Fig.2). This is consistent with previous studies, which found that spaceflight-induced changes to pathogens, such asBacillus subtilis; Escherichia coli; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Staphylococcus aureusreverted upon return to Earth conditions.10 This study is the first to demonstrate that spaceflight influences the growth and virulence characteristics of bacteria grown on a solid substrate. While many previous studies have shown that cell density and growth characteristics are altered in liquid suspension during spaceflight (reviewed in Huang et al.,53) the few studies that have cultured microbes on solid media found no difference in final cell density.54Therefore, it was concluded that because there is no change in gravity vector for bacteria that are attached to a surface compared to those in a liquid suspension where there would be a lack of convection, that one should not expect to see a change in phenotype associated with growth on solid media in spaceflight. This argument is based on the idea that the bacteria are being affected indirectly by microgravity, due to the change in the physical properties of the liquid media that they are in, and not the effect of a change in gravity vector on the microbes themselves.55 However,Serratia marcescensis a nosocomial pathogen that can colonize a wide variety of habitats, and undergo significant phenotypic shifts depending on the properties of the growth media,56–58including shifts in the polarity of the flagella on solid media to produce swarming cells. Because it’s thought that LSMMG may influence cell polarity in some single-celled organisms, it’s at least theoretically possible that some of these species may still be affected by microgravity at the cellular level, even on a solid substrate.59A previous study showed that growth ofE.coliandB.subtilison agar in spaceflight did not show increased growth rates, and they did not measure virulence phenotypes of the samples.54Therefore, it is possible that changes in phenotype in space can be manifested differently in different bacteria depending on the inherent characteristics required to colonize their normal habitat. While Wang et al.60showed thatS. marcescensdid not change in physical properties on a semi-solid media in spaceflight conditions, they did provide evidence that significant transcriptomic and proteomic changes related to metabolism occurred in spaceflight sample compared to ground. We believe that these molecular and biological changes observed inS. marcescenson a semi-solid media in spaceflight provide a basis for the phenotypic changes observed in our study with bacteria grown on solid semi-defined media. While there was insufficient bacterial sample to conduct transcriptomic and proteomic analyses in the current study, a subsequent spaceflight experiment in our lab has been conducted withS. marcescensto further characterize molecular changes on both solid and liquid media types in space and will be reported separately. This indicates that media type should not be limited to liquid suspension, and that further studies using both solid and liquid media types is warranted. A study performed with a different strain ofS. marcescens(ATCC 14041) in LSMMG in liquid media showed that while there was no significant change in growth parameters, there was an increase in acid stress resistance, providing further evidence for phenotypic changes of this species to microgravity and LSMMG.61Ongoing work in our lab, including more in-depth characterization ofS. marcescensunder LSMMG and spaceflight conditions, are currently being conducted to further elucidate the potential molecular and physiological mechanisms affecting growth kinetics and changes in virulence seen in altered gravity. This also emphasizes the need to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms of pathogens that are changing in LSMMG and spaceflight conditions, which has become a field of great interest recently. It has been shown that after spaceflight, there are global changes in expression of genes that may potentially be related to virulence15,17and that some pathogens are more likely to form biofilms after exposure to spaceflight.18Because the pathogens in the current study are also Gram-negative and are similarly opportunistic to the pathogens evaluated in previous studies, it may be expected that there are quantifiable genetic mechanisms that may be responsible for the decreased survival we found after infection. Therefore, current studies are focused on eliciting the potential underlying genetic mechanisms that are driving increased virulence. Fly lines were maintained in a 12-h light-dark cycle on cornmeal-agar media (torula yeast, dextrose, cornmeal, agar, Tegosept, propionic acid, ethanol) at ambient temperature (~24 °C). All fly lines were obtained from Bloomington Stock center includingw1118(#3605), OregonR SP2 (no. 2376), relE20 (no. 55714), y1w* (no. 55707),dif1(no. 36559),imd1(no. 55711),PGRP-LCΔ5(#36323), andPGRP-SAseml(#55716). Bacterial growth conditions during spaceflight Preparation ofS. marcescensDb11 for spaceflight Serratia marcescensDb11 was obtained from the University of MinnesotaC. elegansstock center. To prepare for the spaceflight experiment, the Db11 strain was grown for 20 h in liquid LB broth with 100 µg/mL streptomycin at 37 °C and then diluted to an OD600 of 0.100 in PBS. Next, 100 µL of the diluent was spread onto the surface of two trays containing 2 mL of solid semi-defined fly food media containing 4% Brewer’s yeast (Redstar), 6% glucose, 3% sucrose, 2% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 1% agar, 0.05% magnesium sulfate heptahydrate, 0.05% calcium chloride dihydrate (Sigma), 0.5% of blue food dye (Smart and Final), 0.001% p-hydroxybenzoate, and 0.6% of propionic acid (Sigma) dissolved in water. These two trays were the source of the Space 1 and Space 2 samples that were used in the experiments below. Similarly, we prepared two additional trays (Ground 1 and Ground 2) from the same source sample. These two trays were grown in the same FIT hardware on the ground, inside an incubator (Percival model DR36VL), which was programmed to match the gas composition, temperature, and humidity profiles measured during the flight. After preparing the bacterial sample trays for flight, they were placed into plastic bags and stored at 4 °C, then sent to the ISS on SpaceX CRS-5. Control trays were stored on the ground at 4 °C. Growth conditions on the ISS were described in the previous section. Upon retrieval after the spaceflight mission, bacteria were isolated from the surfaces using sterile cell scrapers and then placed into 50% glycerol and stored frozen at −80 °C. Similar isolation was performed in parallel for the ground samples. The placement of the bacterial cultures on semi-defined fly food media allowed for inflight infection of flies, as flies would ingest the bacteria that was growing on the media. However, due to logistical constraints during flight, in-flight infection was not possible and the bacterial cultures were grown in space and harvested after return for treatment of flies on the ground after flight as described in the following sections. Injection of spaceflightS. marcescensDb11 samples intoD. melanogaster In vivo bacterial load was assayed in the fly at 0, 9, 12, and 15 h post-injection. Bacterial load was assayed immediately following injection by placing three flies in 200 µL of PBS and homogenized for ~1 min using a handheld homogenizer (Kimble/Kontes, New Jersey). This homogenization procedure was repeated for each condition tested. Next, 100 µL of this sample was then spread/plated onto an LB agar plate. To assay subsequent time-points, three flies were placed in 200 µL of PBS and homogenized as above. This sample was then serially diluted, 20 µL into 180 µL of PBS until a dilution of 105was obtained. Next, 40 µL from each dilution from 100 to 105was then spot plated onto an LB agar plate and allowed to dry. All plates were incubated at 37 °C overnight before counting. Each in vivo bacterial load experiment was independently repeated three times and each experiment included three replicate samples per time point for all experiments. Error bars were calculated to represent one standard error. Due to limited bacterial sample availability from the spaceflight mission and the time required to inject 50 or more individual flies per condition per experiment, not all samples (Space 1 and 2, Ground 1 and 2) were included in every experiment. After initial experiments had verified the consistency of the virulence data from Space 1 and Space 2 samples relative to the Ground 1 and Ground 2 samples, only one sample from each spaceflight and ground condition was chosen in subsequent studies. Ground subcultures of spaceflight sample Injections to test the virulence of space-flown bacteria were performed as noted above where the spaceflight and ground bacteria were diluted in PBS from frozen glycerol stocks and directly injected into the fly host. However to test whether the space-flown bacteria would retain their increased virulence after growing under ground conditions for several generations, bacterial cultures were first allowed to grow for 24 h (~23 generations of growth) on the ground before injecting intoDrosophilahosts. A sterile inoculation loop was used to transfer a small amount of glycerol stocks into liquid LB + 100 µg/mL streptomycin, then grown for 24 h in a 37 °C incubator with a shaker set to 225 rpm. These samples were then diluted in PBS down to ~4 × 103CFU/mL in sterile PBS for injections, and injections were performed as described above. Growth ofS. marcescensDb11 in the RWV Cultures of Db11 were grown from non-spaceflight lab stocks of Db11 frozen at −80 °C in Copan Cryovials, onto agar plates with streptomycin (LB + 100 µg/mL) for 18–24 h and then stored at 4 °C for at most 2 weeks. Liquid subcultures were created using a single colony from these agar plates and grown in conical tubes at 37 °C in liquid LB media containing 100 µg/mL streptomycin at 25 rpm for 24 h. These liquid subcultures were then diluted down to A600 of 0.100 in LB media before being further diluted 1:1000 in LB + 100 µg/mL streptomycin and placed into a sterile disposable 10 mL RWV (Synthecon). Air bubbles were removed from the RWV and sealed. Pairs of RWV were then placed in either horizontal (simulated microgravity or LSMMG) or vertical (normal gravity, NG) axis at 37 °C and rotated at 25 rpm (as in Nickerson et al.11) Samples were grown for 24 h to ensure that stationary phase was reached. Injection of RWV samples intoD. melanogaster Injections were performed as noted above with the following alterations. Stationary phase cultures from RWV were diluted down to an A600 of 0.100 in PBS and then further diluted down 1/100 fold to an end concentration of ~8 × 103CFU/mL in PBS. Approximately 65 nL of sterile PBS, LSMMG, or NG cultures were then injected into 2–3-day old flies as noted above. Survival and bacterial load were both monitored as previously stated. RNA extraction and sequencing from infected fly host In order to see whether there was any difference in host immunity after infection with Space or Ground bacteria, RNA was extracted in triplicate from two live ground-reared adult flies for each treatment (space or ground sample injection) approximately 18 h after infection using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit (catalog no. 74104) with β-mercaptoethanol (10 µL/mL) in the lysis buffer. Lysis was performed by placing the flies in a 1.5 mL tube containing 600 µL of the lysis buffer, which were then homogenized for ~1 min using a handheld homogenizer (Kimble/Kontes, New Jersey). The entire homogenate was then placed in the manufacturer-supplied spin column, where an on-column DNase digestion step was performed as per manufacturer recommendation). An additional purification step was added using additional wash steps with the kit buffers. Samples were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform with 100 bp reads and paired-end library prep. Transcript abundance estimates from the raw sequenced reads were made using kallisto (version 0.42.4)68and theD. melanogasterreference transcriptome (build r6.13). Differential expression analysis between Space and Ground bacteria infection conditions was performed using sleuth (version 0.30.0) Wald test.69Transcripts withq-values < 0.05 were considered significantly differentially expressed.
