Hasenstein,hasenstein@louisiana.edu This article was submitted to Plant Abiotic Stress, a section of the journal Frontiers in Plant Science Received 2020 Aug 21; Accepted 2020 Nov 10; Collection date 2020. Although heat and desiccation stresses often coincide, the response to heat especially in desiccation tolerant plants is rarely studied. We subjected hydratedPleopeltis polypodioidesfronds to temperatures up to 50°C and dehydrated fronds up to 65°C for 24 h. The effect of heat stress was evaluated using morphological changes, photosystem (PS) II efficiency, and metabolic indicators. Pinnae of dried fronds exposed to more than 40°C curled tighter and became brittle compared to fronds dried at lower temperatures. Exposure to > 50°C leads to discolored fronds after rehydration. Hydrated fronds turned partially brown at > 35°C. Chlorophyll fluorescence (Ft) and quantum yield (Qy) increased following re-hydration but the recovery process after 40°C treatment lasted longer than at lower temperatures. Similarly, hydrated fronds showed reduced Qywhen exposed to > 40°C. Dried and hydrated fronds remained metabolically active up to 40°C. Hydroperoxides and lipid hydroperoxides in dried samples remained high up to 50°C, but decreased in hydrated fronds at > 40°C. Catalase (CAT) and glutathione (GSH) oxidizing activities remained high up to 40°C in dehydrated fronds and up to 35°C in hydrated fronds. Major fatty acids detected in both dehydrated and hydrated fronds included palmitic (C16:0) and stearic (C18:0) acids, oleic (18:1), linoleic (C18:2); and linolenic (C18:3) acids. Linolenic acid was most abundant. In dried fronds, all fatty acids decreased at > 35°C. The combined data indicate that the thermotolerance of dry fronds is about 55°C but is at least 10°C lower for hydrated fronds. Plants not only experience heat- but also desiccation stress, which stems from loss of water via evapotranspiration. Distinguishing combined stresses is difficult because many of the physiological and molecular responses between these stresses overlap (Zandalinas et al., 2018). Some studies suggest that the combination of these two stresses is more deleterious to plant growth and productivity than each individual stress (Jiang and Huang, 2001;Rizhsky et al., 2002;Lipiec et al., 2013;Zandalinas et al., 2018) and the response to combined stresses cannot be extrapolated from the individual stress (Zandalinas et al., 2018). Therefore, studies typically report the combined effects of heat and drought stress (Rizhsky et al., 2002;Bhardwaj et al., 2015;Zandalinas et al., 2018). However, this approach obscures the individual stress response. Additionally, separating heat from desiccation stress is not possible in the field and difficult to establish even under laboratory conditions but leads to meaningful characterization of the metabolic response to individual stressors. Plants that are especially well-suited to study desiccation stress are “resurrection” plants. These plants are defined by their vegetative tissues being able to sustain desiccation to water potentials as low as −100 MPa (Gaff, 1997). They can reach complete air dryness and rehydrate without suffering noticeable injury. Because these plants can sustain desiccation and attain certain levels of quiescence during this process, their heat tolerance can be tested in dry and hydrated conditions. A large body of research has reported thermotolerance capacity of non-vascular, poikilohydric species such as bryophytes (Lange, 1955;Nörr, 1974;Meyer and Santarius, 1998) and lichens (Lange, 1953;Tegler and Kershaw, 1981). Although thermo and frost resistance of desiccation tolerant pteridophytes (Kappen, 1964) and heat resistance of desiccation tolerant pteridophytes (Eickmeier, 1986) and angiosperms (Hambler, 1961;Kappen, 1966;Vieweg and Ziegler, 1969) was examined, there is no information on biochemical responses of these plants to elevated temperatures. Based on morphological and photosynthetic responses, there is general consensus that non-vascular and vascular plants show increased thermotolerance after desiccation (Macfarlane and Kershaw, 1978;Tegler and Kershaw, 1981;Eickmeier, 1986). However, the dependency on seasonal conditions also indicates that desiccation alone is insufficient to establish thermotolerance. To dissect the biochemical responses to heat and desiccation, we studied the response of the desiccation tolerant fernPleopletis polypodioidesin dry and hydrated fronds. Because pteridophytes are widely distributed and successfully established in various environments, they not only provide essential information on the evolution of desiccation tolerance but also serve an excellent model to study the effects of heat stress. Pleopeltis polypodioides(aka resurrection fern) can tolerate loss of 95% of cellular water content and regain full metabolic activities within a few hours of rehydration (Pessin, 1924;Stuart, 1968;John and Hasenstein, 2017). In response to dehydration, the ventral surface curls inward and the dorsal surface, covered with peltate scales, remains exposed (Pessin, 1924). Such folding mechanisms, also demonstrated by other resurrection plants, are thought to be a defensive mechanism against photooxidation (Farrant et al., 1999;Helseth and Fischer, 2005). Although there is plenty of information on morphological changes of plants in response to heat and desiccation stress, adaptations of ferns to desiccation (Pessin, 1924;Stuart, 1968;Helseth and Fischer, 2005;John and Hasenstein, 2017), and biochemical response to drought (Maslenkova and Homann, 2000;Georgieva and Maslenkova, 2001;Layton et al., 2010;John and Hasenstein, 2018) are limited. In addition, the response of Pleopeltis to heat has not been investigated. Summary of the workflow of experiments and analyses performed on dried, rehydrated, and submersed Pleopeltis fronds. Data obtained from the initial sample status (red boxes) served a reference for all other treatments. Heat treatment was applied for 24 h in darkness. Assays of heat treated dry and hydrated (fully and partly submersed) samples were compared with 25°C dry and fresh control, respectively. Detached, fresh fronds were dried at 25°C for 72 h, which reduces the RWC to < 5% (John and Hasenstein, 2018). After drying, the fronds were exposed to temperatures between 30 and 50°C for 24 h in an incubator. Relative humidity decreased as a function of temperature increase. Detached fresh fronds were placed in DI water in 20 mL glass vials such that either the entire frond (vial filled with 20 mL water) or just the apical end (4 mL water) was submersed and exposed to the same temperature as dried fronds. The reason for different levels of submersion was to test the effect of oxygen deprivation in fronds that were fully submersed compared to 100% humidity. The data were compared with hydrated fronds (without immersion) at 25°C. The photosynthetic performance of the fronds before and after heat stress and after re-hydration was assessed by measuring the minimum chlorophyll fluorescence (F0, which is equivalent to Ftif the leaf sample is dark-adapted) and quantum yield (Qy) using a FluorPen FP100 (Photo Systems Instruments, Czechia). F0was measured by applying a light pulse (455 nm of 0.09 μmoles m–2s–1for 30 μs) and recorded as Ft. Similarly, Qymeasurements were obtained by applying a saturating light that measures maximum value of fluorescence (Fm) from PS II (approximately 3000 μmol m–2s–1for 0.8 s) to dark-adapted dry fronds and dim-light (∼10 μM m–2s–1) exposed fronds. Preliminary measurements showed no difference between dark or dim-light adapted measurements. The difference between minimal fluorescence F0and maximal fluorescence Fmdivided by Fm, i.e., (Fm-F0)/Fm. We used this ratio to describe quantum yield (Qy) of PS II system. Normal photosynthetic activity shows maximum Qyof about 0.83 (Maxwell and Johnson, 2000;Murchie and Lawson, 2013). We considered reduced values indicative of stress. The Ftand Qydata were collected from fresh, dried and 24 h heat treated fronds as well as after re-hydration for 1, 5, and 24 h at room temperature (25°C). Because obtaining reliable fluorescence measurements from curled (dried) fronds was difficult, the Ftand Qymeasurements were obtained from flattened fronds that were dried between paper towels and glass plates for 5 days at room temperature. Dried and submersed fronds were examined after temperature treatments. Fronds were rehydrated on water-saturated foam under dim light, and were measured after 1, 5, and 24 h. Qyand Ftwere identical in dark and dim-light-maintained fronds, we therefore report data of fronds measured under dim light (10 μM m–2s–1). The Ftand Qymeasurements were obtained from the base, center, and the tip of each of six fronds and shown as average of these positions. Cell membrane permeability was deduced from the conductivity (μS cm–1) of the water in which the fronds were submersed. Conductivity was measured with a MW 301 EC meter (Milwaukee Instruments, Inc.) in 4 mL samples for partially and 20 mL samples in fully submersed fronds and reported as μS normalized to 10 mL. After heat treatments, fronds were kept at room temperature for an additional 24 h to assess re-uptake of ions. Elemental analysis was performed by Inductively Coupled Plasma – Optical Emission Spectrometry (Perkin Elmer, Optima 5300 DV) in 15% HNO3. In their natural environment, Pleopeltis fronds are exposed to sometimes extreme fluctuations of temperatures, humidity, and light intensities. Our intention is to understand how Pleopeltis responds to heat stress. Because measuring enzyme activities of dried fronds inevitably requires hydration, metabolic activities of dried fronds may not represent the actual activity in the dried state but indicate available metabolites and metabolic capacity at the endpoint of dehydration. Despite these limitations, the following tests were performed with dehydrated and hydrated fronds. The reduction of resazurin as described inJohn and Hasenstein (2017)served as proxy for the assessment of vitality. Pinnae [100 mg dry weight equivalents, calculated as FW/(1-RWC) as documented inJohn and Hasenstein (2018)] were macerated in 2 mL of 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) and 0.2 mL of 4 mM resazurin (Sigma R7017), and incubated under continuous illumination (∼300 μM m–2s–1) at 25°C for 3 h before the fluorescence of the supernatant was determined (Varian Cary, λex = 560 nm; λem = 590 nm). Hydroperoxide (and other water-soluble peroxide) content was measured using the ferrous ammonium sulfate/xylenol orange, FOX I assay (Wolff, 1994;Cheeseman, 2006) at 560 nm (John and Hasenstein, 2018). Hydroperoxide quantification in μM was based on a standard curve and calculated as (OD560– 0.004)/0.0763. The FOX II assay was used to quantify lipid peroxides, LOOHs (Jiang et al., 1992;Gay and Gebicki, 2003) according toJohn and Hasenstein (2018)such that (OD560− 0.1305)/0.0383, determines the BHT equivalent in nM. Catalase activity was determined from the decrease of OD240of H2O2for 180 s (John and Hasenstein, 2018). Based on 100 mg samples, enzyme activity was expressed as μM × min–1× mg protein–1. Consumption of Reduced Glutathione The consumption of GSH was measured as described earlier (John and Hasenstein, 2018). The assay was modified after (Starlin and Gopalakrishnan, 2013). Samples (100 mg DW equivalent) were extracted in chilled sodium phosphate buffer (40 mM, pH 7, 2 mL) and centrifuged (23,000g, 12 min, 4°C). 500 μL supernatant was transferred into a fresh centrifuge tube, mixed with 400 μL 40 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.0, 100 μL 10 mM sodium azide (Sigma, S-2002), 200 μL DI water, and vortexed. After adding 200 μL (4 mM) GSH (Cayman chemical company, 10007461) and 100 μL 2.5 mM H2O2, the solution was mixed and incubated for 1 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 500 μL of 10% trichloroacetic acid (Aldrich Chemical Company, 76-03-9). The solution was incubated at RT for 30 min and centrifuged (23,000g, 5 min, 4°C). The supernatant (500 μL) was mixed with 1.5 mL 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) and 1 mL 5, 5’-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid (Sigma, D8130). After inversion, OD 409 was determined. Enzyme activity is reported as μM GSH consumed min–1× mg protein–1. Protein content for the enzyme assays was determined according toBradford (1976)using ovalbumin (Sigma, A-5378) as standard. Fatty acids were extracted from tissue equivalent to 100 mg fresh weight, derivatized to their methyl esters, and quantified (John and Hasenstein, 2018) using an Agilent (Wilmington, DE, United States) gas chromatograph (6890) with mass selective detector (5973). One μL samples were injected and separated on a Phenomenex Zebron ZB-5MS column with hydrogen as carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.8 mL min–1. The temperature profile started at 100°C for 2 min, ramped (10°C × min–1) to 280°C and held for another 8 min. Identification of compounds was based on the National Institute of Science and Technology library 2008 in Chemstation software (E.02.02.1431). The quantity of individual fatty acids was determined based on retention time and slope of derivatized palmitic acid (Sigma, P-5917; Rt = 11.7 min; 3.98 × 106 TIC ng–1), linoleic acid (Sigma, L1376; Rt = 13.3 min, 3.53 × 106 TIC ng–1), linolenic acid (Cayman Chemical Company, 90210; Rt = 13.37 min; 2.51 × 106 TIC ng–1), oleic acid (Sigma, O1630; Rt = 13.4 min; 1.88 × 106 TIC ng–1), and stearic acid (Sigma, S-4751; Rt = 13.6 min; 3.05 × 106 TIC ng–1). Tissue samples were analyzed under identical conditions as standards. The data are reported as means of three to six biological replicates obtained from individual fronds. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey-Kramerpost hoctest was performed using Excel data analysis tool pack (Microsoft Corporation, 2016). Response of dehydrated(A,B,C), submersed(G,H,I), and partly submersed(J,K,L)fronds to 24 h heating at 30, 40, and 50°C, and fronds re-hydrated after exposure to 55, 60, and 65°C(D,E,F). Exposure to ≥ 40°C resulted in tight curling of dehydrated fronds and browning of the hydrated fronds. Re-hydrated fronds show discoloration near the rachis between 55 and 60°C and complete discoloration of the frond after 65°C. Scale bar = 1 cm.

Changes in Frond Shape and Color In response to increasing temperature, dehydrated Pleopeltis fronds became thinner, pinnae curled tighter (Figures 2B,C), and after exposure to ≥ 45°C fronds became brittle. Such dramatic changes are likely a response to the combination of water loss and heat that reduces matrix hydration and therefore affects shape and elasticity of cell wall polymers (Lima et al., 2013). These changes possibly indicate glass transition, which facilitates survival in ferns spores (Ballesteros et al., 2017). Among the cell wall polymers, pectin affects the elasticity of the cell wall (Willats et al., 2001) and heat sensitivity (Lima et al., 2013). Loss of pectin functionality leads to increased cell wall porosity, brittleness, and conductive evaporation (Willats et al., 2001;Bethke et al., 2016). Pectin arrangements are likely modified in response to the combination of drying and elevated temperatures, but further research is needed to assess the status of pectin in the cell wall of dried Pleopeltis fronds. Fronds exposed to 30–50°C fully expanded upon rehydration (at 25°C) and did not show necrosis, or changes in shape of the fronds (data not shown). Ftand Qyof partly and fully submersed (Figures 3C–F) fronds exposed to ≤ 35°C were not affected. However, at 40°C, Qy decreased while Ftincreased. Similar to observations in dried tissue, this unequal response indicates a dichotomy between chlorophyll stability and reduced photosynthetic efficiency, possibly as a result from inactivation of the oxygen evolving system (Wise et al., 2004) and/or the PS II reaction center (Bolharnordenkampe et al., 1989). The reduction of Ftat > 40°C and non-detectable Qy(Figures 3D,F) indicates that the fronds become photosynthetically non-functional beyond 40°C and identifies the thermal tolerance of hydrated fronds as 40°C. Reactive Oxygen Species and Antioxidant Enzyme Activities The mechanism of Pleopeltis response to heat stress is complex. Our biochemical data indicate that > 40°C causes heat stress in Pleopeltis fronds. Despite obvious stress signals, dried fronds recovered after exposure up to 55°C while thermo-tolerance of hydrated fronds was limited to 40°C. The difference in heat tolerance between hydrated and dried fronds indicates that dehydration protects Pleopeltis from heat damage. Our data further illustrate the adaptability of this epiphytic fern to cope with environmental stress. SJ and KH conceived the experiments, analyzed the data, and wrote the manuscript.
