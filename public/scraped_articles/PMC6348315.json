  "content": "A member of the CONSTANS-Like protein family is a putative regulator of reactive oxygen species homeostasis and spaceflight physiological adaptation Corresponding author’s e-mail address:alp@ufl.edu Received 2018 Oct 12; Accepted 2018 Dec 12; Collection date 2019 Feb. A feature of the physiological adaptation to spaceflight inArabidopsis thaliana(Arabidopsis) is the induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-associated gene expression. The patterns of ROS-associated gene expression vary amongArabidopsisecotypes, and the role of ROS signalling in spaceflight acclimation is unknown. What could differences in ROS gene regulation between ecotypes on orbit reveal about physiological adaptation to novel environments? Analyses of ecotype-dependent responses to spaceflight resulted in the elucidation of a previously uncharacterized gene (OMG1) as being ROS-associated. TheOMG15′ flanking region is an active promoter in cells where ROS activity is commonly observed, such as in pollen tubes, root hairs, and in other tissues upon wounding. qRT-PCR analyses revealed that upon wounding on Earth, OMG1 is an apparent transcriptional regulator ofMYB77andGRX480, which are associated with the ROS pathway. Fluorescence-based ROS assays show that OMG1 affects ROS production. Phylogenetic analysis of OMG1 and closely related homologs suggests that OMG1 is a distant, unrecognized member of the CONSTANS-Like protein family, a member that arose via gene duplication early in the angiosperm lineage and subsequently lost its first DNA-binding B-box1 domain. These data illustrate that members of the rapidly evolving COL protein family play a role in regulating ROS pathway functions, and their differential regulation on orbit suggests a role for ROS signalling in spaceflight physiological adaptation. Plants adjust to spaceflight by changing patterns of gene expression. The analysis of how differentArabidopsisplants respond to space resulted in the discovery of a previously uncharacterized gene (OMG1), which was consistently induced in space. This research revealed that OMG1 belongs to the CONSTANS-Like protein family and is involved in maintaining the reactive oxygen species pathway, which appears to be an important feature of the physiological adaptation of plants to the spaceflight environment. It also shows that spaceflight experiments can be used as a platform to discover novel gene function and provide further insights into terrestrial plant biology. The complex networks and signalling pathways that equip plants to cope with environmental challenge developed over evolutionary time in terrestrial environments. Exposing plants to novel environments presents opportunities to understand how plants adjust to conditions outside their evolutionary experience. Spaceflight is one such novel environment, and understanding how plants function outside of Earth’s boundaries is also integral to space exploration. Plants respond to spaceflight in ways that are dependent on species, ecotype, genetics and even organs (Cowleset al.1984;Hosonet al.2002;Sogaet al.2002;Paulet al.2013a;Ferlet al.2014). Indeed, even a single gene difference can influence the spaceflight response (Paulet al.2017), thus investigating ecotype-dependent spaceflight transcriptomes can reveal strategies for physiological adaptation to spaceflight while expanding understanding of gene function in terrestrial environments. The physiological impact of spaceflight is reflected in the patterns of gene expression. Irrespective of plant growth hardware, duration in space or age of plants, one consensus is that spaceflight elicits responses from pathways associated with cell wall remodelling, cell polarity, phytohormone-mediated processes, as well as general stress responses, such as wounding, pathogen defence, heat shock and reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Jooet al.2001;Paulet al.2005,2012b,2013a;Correllet al.2013;Zupanskaet al.2013;Ferlet al.2014;Mazarset al.2014;Sugimotoet al.2014;Zhanget al.2014;Kwonet al.2015;Schüleret al.2015). In addition, a large proportion of genes differentially expressed in spaceflight encode unknown proteins. Spaceflight-grownArabidopsisroots tend to be smaller, have fewer lateral roots and shorter root hair development than their terrestrial controls (Paulet al.2012a;Kwonet al.2015). Aspects of these morphologies in ecotype Columbia (Col-0) suggest a relationship between the down-regulation of several peroxidase genes in spaceflight (Kwonet al.2015). In this study, a spaceflight-induced gene of unknown function identified from roots was investigated for its potential involvement in ROS-related functions. AT1G05290, which we have dubbedOrbitally Manifested Gene 1(OMG1), was one of the highest significantly (P= 0.0005) induced genes in the Advanced Plant Experiment 01 (APEX01) spaceflight data set (fold change = 12) (Paulet al.2013a). Two distinct biochemical assays typically used to measure ROS activity indicated that knocking out OMG1 alters the production of ROS. Co-expression networks aroundOMG1show correlations to genes involved in ROS-associated oxidative phosphorylation pathwaysObayashiet al. 2014.OMG1was also expressed in organs known to highly utilize ROS during development, such as root hairs and pollen tubes (Shin and Schachtman 2004;Potockýet al.2007;Winteret al.2007;Lassiget al.2014). In addition,OMG1is an unrealized member of the CONSTANS-Like family of transcription factors. These findings, originating with the novel environment of spaceflight, further the understanding of plant growth and development and provide insight into the role of a heretofore unknown gene. The ROSMETER tool assesses the ROS-related transcriptomic signature in a large-scaleArabidopsisgene expression data set (Rosenwasseret al.2013).Arabidopsisgene expression profiles from two independent spaceflight experiments, APEX01 and Advanced Plant Experiment 03-2 (APEX03-2), along with their corresponding ground controls, were used to correlate differential gene expression in spaceflight with specific ROS species and origins. The APEX01 experiment utilized two ecotypes and both were planted on each plate of the experiment. Since the entire plate was harvested on orbit to a single tube, the subsequent transcriptomic analyses comprised 60 % Wassilewskija (WS) and 40 % Col-0 (Paulet al.2013b). In the APEX03-2 data set, WS and Col-0 were kept on separate plates, harvested into separate tubes and analysed individually. A data set from Col-0 compared to WS vertically grown in standard laboratory conditions was included as an additional control (Schultzet al.2017). From each data set, Affymetrix Probeset-ID, Gene Locus ID,P-value and fold change were listed and submitted to ROSMETER. The heatmap was constructed using the GENE-E software with hierarchical clustering using the Matrix value offered in the software. Plant materials and growth conditions Seeds from both Col-0 and WS were prepared for APEX01 and APEX03-2 as previously described (Paulet al.2012b,2013b;Snget al.2014;Ferl and Paul 2016). Briefly, plants were cultured on Phytagel™ 10 cm Petri plates and grown either in the Advanced Biological Research System (ABRS) hardware (APEX01), or in the Veggie hardware (APEX03-2) under continuous lighting of ~80–135 μmol m−2s−1PAR. In this study, the effects of the spaceflight environment were evaluated, which includes ambient radiation, microgravity and attending effects on convection. In both experiments, the ground control plants were grown with a 24- to 48-h schedule delay that allowed the comparable ground growth chambers to be programmed with the precise environmental conditions that the International Space Station (ISS)-grown plants received on orbit. Plants grown for additional laboratory analyses were grown on Phytagel™ 10 cm plates or in soil, and placed in a greenhouse growth chamber on a 24-h light cycle (~80 μmol m−2s−1PAR) at 22 °C. OMG1 promoter::GUSmgfp5 transgenic plants and analyses A 0.8-kb 5′ flanking region upstream of the OMG1 (AT1G05290) initial Met was amplified fromArabidopsisgDNA using primer pair A[seeSupporting Information—Table S1], which contains restriction enzyme sites BamHI in the forward primer and NcoI in the reverse. The sequenced and confirmed BamHI/NcoI fragment containing the OMG1 5′ flanking region was cloned into pCAMBIA1303 to create the OMG1p::GUSmgfp5 fusion construct. Although this region may not represent the full complement of motifs that regulate OMG1, the 0.8-kb 5′ flanking region does serve to promote OMG1 transcription and will be referred to as the basal promoter. The construct was then transformed intoAgrobacterium(Agrobacterium tumefaciens) strain GV3101 for floral dip transformation into WS plants (Clough and Bent 1998). Ten independent OMG1p::GUSmgfp5 transgenic lines grown on selection media (250 mg L−1Carbenecillin and 50 mg L−1Hygromycin) were screened for T3 homozygosity. Plants grown on Phytagel plates were used for histochemical localization of β-glucuronidase (GUS) (Jeffersonet al.1987). Pollen and pollen tube analyses were performed as described (Liet al.1999). T1 heterozygous populations of pollen grains and tubes were incubated with X-Gluc to reveal the specificity of the histochemical localization in transformed pollen. Basal OMG1 promoter activity in plants requires ~3 h of staining before detection of GUS in the various locations, whereas GUS activity induced by wounding was observed within 30 min of staining. In the GUS qRT-PCR wounding experiments with OMG1p::GUSmgfp5, comparable leaves from three individual plants were crimped with forceps and left intact on the plant for the duration of each time point (30 min, 1, 4 and 16 h). Leaves were harvested to liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until RNA extraction. In the mock and immediate time point, leaves were either unwounded or crimped and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted using RNAeasy (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA transcribed from total RNA was used to analyse the transcript abundance ofGUSA. Primer pairs B and C[seeSupporting Information—Table S1]were used for the analyses.GUSAtranscript abundance was normalized to UBQ11 (AT4G05050). Gene expression analyses of OMG1 and other downstream genes OMG1 RT-qPCR analyses used TaqMan™ (Applied Biosystems) on spaceflight material from APEX01 and APEX03-2.OMG1gene expression was normalized toUBQ11primer and probe sequences D and E[seeSupporting Information—Table S1]. Theomg1knockout (KO) line (SALK_045742C) was validated for a homozygous T-DNA insertion using primers F. Homozygous lines were selfed until all progeny were homozygous and screened for the absence of full-lengthOMG1transcript[seeSupporting Information—Fig. S1]. RT-qPCR analyses ofOMG1expression induced by a time course wounding assay were performed on wild-type (WT) Col-0, WS andomg1lines. Three individual plants with leaves of similar ages and sizes were wounded by crushing between two glass slides. The wounded leaves were left attached to the plant for the allotted times (mock, immediate, 5, 10, 30 min and 1 h) before being harvested into liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. RT-qPCR analysis was conducted using SYBR Green master mix (Applied Biosystems) along with the primer pairs C, D (without probe), G–H and L–R[seeSupporting Information—Table S1]. Fluorescent biochemical ROS assays For the ROS accumulation assay, intact leaves from WT Col-0,omg1KO andrbohdKO (SALK_070610) were wounded with a 10 µL pipette tip and immediately immersed into the fluorescent probe 5-(and 6)-carboxy-2′,7′-dichloro dihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA) (Sigma) solution as described in (Beneloujaephajriet al.2013). Briefly, wounded and unwounded leaves were vacuum infiltrated in the dark for 20 min in 60 µM of DCF-DA in standard buffer. Leaves were then rinsed in standard buffer and observed under GFP bandpass filters using the Olympus BX51 compound light microscope at 10× magnification with 55 ms exposure time. Quantification of fluorescence intensity using ImageJ software was previously described (Jakicet al.2017). A luminol-based ROS assay was done by measuring hydrogen peroxide produced by leaf discs when exposed to flg22. Discs (0.125 cm2) of 6-week-old WT Col-0,omg1andrbohdplants were incubated in 100 µL ddH2O overnight in 96-well luminometer plates. Water was replaced with the reaction solution of 40 µM luminol (Sigma-Aldrich) and 10 µg mL−1horseradish peroxidase (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 50 nM of flg22 or water for the mock controls. ROS measurements expressed as means of RLU (relative light units) were taken at 2-min intervals for a period of 38 min. Protein structural modelling of the B-box2 domain was done using both the Phyre2 and Chimera (Pettersenet al.2004). The closest OMG1 homolog, c2junA of the human Midline-1 (MID1) with a 92 % confidence level was used to predict the overall folding of the B-box domains in OMG1. The predicted structural model of OMG1 was compared to the x-ray crystal structure of c2junA using Chimera and MatchMaker. Side chains positioned near the zinc ions were displayed to predict the potential of OMG1 binding to zinc ions. 35S promoter:OMG1cds-sGFPS65T fusion construct for subcellular localization The coding sequence of OMG1 (RefSeq ID:NP_172021.2) was amplified from cDNA using primer pair I[seeSupporting Information—Table S1]. The PCR fragment was sequenced before being cloned into the pCAMBIA1303 along with sGFP(S65T) (Chiuet al.1996) gene via SpeI and BstEII restriction sites using primer pairs J[seeSupporting Information—Table S1]. Primer pair K was then used to amplify the entire OMG1cds-sGFP(S65T), which was validated by sequencing and cloned into pCAMBIA1302 vector via NcoI and BstEII restriction sites. For subcellular localization,Agrobacterium-GV3101 containing 100 µM acetosyringone, 0.05 % Silwet-77 and the pCAMBIA1302 vector or pCAMBIA1302-OMG1cds-sGFPS65T fusion vector were incubated in the dark for 20 min at 28 °C. Leaves of 4-week-old tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) seedlings were injected and GFP signal was observed after 2 days at 25 °C in the dark. DAPI was used to indicate the nucleus. ROS-producing genes are differentially expressed in response to spaceflight in an ecotype-specific manner Correlations between spaceflight transcriptome and ROS-related microarrays revealed that ROS is induced in spaceflight in an ecotype-dependent manner. (A) The microarray (APEX01) and the RNAseq (APEX03-2) analyses of spaceflight transcriptional profile relative to the ground control profile were correlated to known ROS-related data sets producing specific ROS species from specific locations within the cell using the bioinformatics tool called ROSMETER (Rosenwasseret al.2013). Positive correlations (red) show ROS production, whereas negative correlations (blue) show ROS scavenging. Black cells suggest no correlations, whereas gray cells indicate that there are insufficient gene numbers for a statistical correlation. Clusters highlighted in yellow boxes denote regions of interest. Group A showed that only the spaceflight transcriptome of WS positively correlated with the cytoplasmic ascorbate peroxidase knockout (KO-APX1) experiments, which represent cytoplasmic H2O2ROS indices. Group B showed ecotype-related differences in the correlations associated with mitochondrial stress. (B) Peroxidase genes having statically (P< 0.01) differential expression (>1 or −1 < log2 fold) between spaceflight and ground control in both WS and Col-0 ecotypes are depicted. Blue is indicative of down-regulation, red is indicative of up-regulation and gray indicates no statistically significant differential expression. OMG1 transcript is up-regulated in WS ecotype across multiple spaceflight experiments OMG1expression was up-regulated in WS roots across multiple spaceflight experiments (APEX01-1B, APEX01-2B and APEX03-2) but remained unchanged in Col-0 (Fig. 2). The Box-Whisker plot ofFig. 2illustrates the median fold change ofOMG1expression between spaceflight and the ground control from a total of nine replicates from each sample. Each spaceflight experiment represents a distinct launch and orbital plant growth event. In both the APEX01 experiments, seeds germinated on orbit grew for 12 days before being harvested.OMG1expression shows a 4-fold change in spaceflight compared to ground controls in APEX01-2B and 3.5-fold change in APEX01-1B. In both analyses, the large spread between the maximum and the minimum can be attributed to the mixture of ecotypes. In a subsequent spaceflight experiment, APEX03-2, plants grew for 8 or 11 days on the ISS before being harvested. In the APEX03-2 8-day-old plants, Col-0 showed a median fold change of 1 (no change), whereas WS showed a 3.9-fold increase in spaceflight. In the APEX03-2 11-day-old plants, Col-0 showed a median fold change of 1 and WS showed a 2.1-fold increase in expression. The OMG1 basal promoter activity was observed in roots, pollen tubes and upon wounding Histochemical GUS staining revealed some basalOMG1promoter activity in roots and pollen but showed heighten activity upon wounding in the roots and leaves. T3 homozygousOMG1p::GUSmgfp5transgenic plants were used to characterize the activity of theOMG1promoter. In roots, basalOMG1promoter activity was observed at low levels in the maturation zone of both the primary and lateral roots and root hairs (Fig. 3A, i–iv). In addition, basal promoter activity was also observed in pollen grains and pollen tubes (Fig. 3A, v–vii). A T1 heterozygous population of pollen grains grown in pollen germinating media (Fig. 3A, vii) was used to visualize the specificity of the GUS enzymatic reactions in transformed pollen. Serendipitously, wounded plant tissues were observed to have heightenedOMG1promoter activity (Fig. 3B). To ensure thatOMG1promoter activity was specific to wounding, leaf and root tissues from WT Col-0,ADHp::GUS(Chung and Ferl 1999) andOMG1p::GUSmgfp5lines were wounded with a pair of forceps. In this wounding experiment, GUS staining was observed only in theOMG1p::GUSmgfp5line. A qRT-PCR analysis ofGUSAtranscripts from leaves wounded at different time points showed thatOMG1promoter activity heightens immediately after wounding and dissipates after 30 min (Fig. 3C). OMG1 regulates the expression of MYB77 and GRX480 known to be induced in spaceflight and upon wounding Eight genes[seeSupporting Information—Table S2]were used to elucidate potential functional interactions with OMG1. SinceOMG1promoter activity was shown to rise immediately after wounding (Fig. 3C), a wounding time course of mock, immediate, 10 min and 1 h was used to screen the expression of the genes listed inSupporting Information—Table S2that could be affected by knocking outOMG1. Two genes,GRX480(At1g28480) andMYB77(At3g50060), out of eight genes tested showed significant differences (Student’st-testP< 0.05) in gene expression between WT andomg1lines (Fig. 4DandF). The expression ofGRX480was repressed after wounding in theomg1line and did not increase as did the WT line. On the other hand,MYB77expressed in theomg1line showed a significant delay in down-regulating gene expression when compared to the WT at the 10-min post-wounding time point. MYB77 and GRX480 were significantly differentially expressed between Col-0 and WS (Fig. 5). Col-0 showed a median fold change of 1.7 and WS showed a 3-fold increase inMYB77expression in spaceflight relative to ground controls (Fig. 5A). In theGRX480analyses, Col-0 showed a median fold change of 0.3 and WS showed a median fold change of 1.3 in spaceflight relative to ground controls (Fig. 5B). OMG1regulates the rapid wounding response ofMYB77andGRX480. WT Col-0 andomg1KO intact leaf tissues were untouched (mock) or wounded with a pair of forceps and left for the indicated time points before harvesting for qRT-PCR analyses. Expression of the indicated genes (A–H) shared between spaceflight, rapid wounding and pollen development[seeSupporting Information—Table S2]in the WT (Col-0) andomg1KO leaves was analysed. Untouched leaves (mock), immediately after wounding, 10-min post-wounding and 1-h post-wounding were the indicated time points that the transcripts were measured. The average relative expression was normalized to a housekeeping gene (UBQ11) and presented relative to the mock controls. * indicate significance (P< 0.05), ** (P< 0.001) between WT Col-0 andomg1which was calculated by doing a two-factor ANOVA followed bypost hocStudent’st-test. All error bars represent the standard error of the mean of triplicate representative experiments. MYB77andGRX480expression of APEX03-2 spaceflight experiment showed higher fold change in WS compared to the Col-0 ecotype. (A) qRT-PCR done on APEX03-2 11d spaceflight root tissue show thatMYB77transcript in spaceflight relative to ground controls is significantly (P= 0.001) different between WS and Col-0 plants. The fold change ofMYB77expression is higher in the WS ecotype compared to the Col-0 ecotype. (B) qRT-PCR showed a significant (P= 0.007) difference in the expression fold change ofGRX480between Col-0 and WS plants. Boxplots were derived from nine replicates normalized to UBQ11 and plotted spaceflight relative to ground control. ** indicate (P< 0.01) significant difference between Col-0 and WS was calculated by doing a Student’st-test. ROS accumulation upon wounding and flg22 induction is altered inomg1KO leaves compared to Col-0 leaves Wild-type Col-0,omg1and respiratory burst oxidase homology D (rbohd) KO plants, which are delayed in ROS accumulation (Milleret al.2009), were subjected to mechanical wounding with a pipette tip. The production of hydroxyl, peroxyl and other ROS activity within the cells was measured with DCF-DA assay. Green fluorescence at the site of wounding was captured after 20 min with light microscopy. Wild-type Col-0 leaves produced ROS around the wound site, whereas neitheromg1norrbohdshowed prominent production of ROS (Fig. 6A). Quantification of fluorescence using ImageJ showed significant differences (Student’st-testP< 0.01) between Col-0 and the mutant lines (Fig. 6B). Based on luminol ROS assays OMG1 affects the elicitor-induced generation of extracellular ROS. Flg22-induced hydrogen peroxide production by leaf discs ofomg1mutants was ~20 % higher compared to Col-0. Water-treated controls along with therbohdleaf discs showed no production of flg22-induced H2O2(Fig. 6C). Since elicitor-induced extracellular ROS is governed byRbohD, the measurement ofRbohDexpression between Col-0 andomg1lines in a wounding time course was analysed (Fig. 6D). The relative expression ofRbohDshowed no significant difference between WT andomg1leaves. OMG1 is a member of the CONSTANS-Like protein family The predictedOMG1gene encodes a 369 amino acid protein that contains a C-terminal 43 amino acid sequence that is 84 % sequence similarity to the (CONSTANS (CO), CONSTANS-Like (COL) and TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION1 (TOC1)) ‘CCT’ domain (Berardiniet al.2015). OMG1 also contains two divergent B-box domains in the N-terminal region[seeSupporting Information—Fig. S2]. The OMG1 B-box1 domain has 51 % similarity to the B-box1 consensus sequence, and the OMG1 B-box2 domain has a 94 % similarity to the B-box2 consensus sequence (Griffithset al.2003;Masakiet al.2005;Gangappa and Botto 2014). A consensus phylogeny suggests that OMG1 belongs to group II of the CO and COL family of transcriptional regulators (Fig. 6). Maximum likelihood phylogenies placed a clade of OMG1-related sequences from Brassicas and Monocots (SH-like aLRT > 0.989) close to COL11-12 sequences from across flowering plants[seeSupporting Information—Table S3]. OMG1 appears closely related to the COL11-12 and COL9-10 lineages, although the precise placement of the OMG1 group remains unresolved. Both the OMG1 and the COL11-12 clades consist of sequences representing both monocots and dicots. In the consensus tree, a single COL11-12-like sequence from the basal flowering plantAmborella trichopodarooted the OMG1 and COL11-12 clades (SH-like aLRT > 0.912), suggesting that the OMG1 lineage arose via a gene-duplication event in flowering plants, prior to the divergence of monocots and dicots (Fig. 7). However, no OMG1-related sequences from Eudicots were observed outside the Brassicaceae family, suggesting that either OMG1 was lost from non-Brassica dicots, or the sequence has diverged so much in these lineages as to be unrecognizable. The different alignment and tree-reconstruction procedures support the early-duplication hypothesis, and make it unlikely that the grouping of monocot and dicot OMG1-related sequences is a phylogenetic artefact. OMG1 is a member of the CO and COL protein family inArabidopsis. The consensus tree derived from full-length protein sequences containing a single CCT domain of all plants found in the non-redundant (NR) database revealed that OMG1 belongs to the CO and COL family of proteins. InArabidopsis(taxa highlighted in cyan), the COL family can be divided into three groups. Group I (shaded in light blue) comprises of CO, COL1-6 which have domain structures consisting of two B-box domains (type I and type II) at the N-terminal and both a VP motif along with a CCT domain at the C-terminal. Genes in group II (shaded in light purple) comprising of COL9-15 and OMG1 have domain structure consisting of a type I B-box domain and a second diverged B-box2 domain along with a C-terminal CCT domain. The OMG1 clade is highlighted in red, whereas its closest homolog COL11-12 is highlighted in green. Group III (shaded in light orange) comprises of COL6-8 and COL16 have domain structures consisting of a single B-box1 domain and a CCT domain. Listed in the grey boxes are the characterized functions of some of the COL members (Gangappa and Botto 2014). The high level of sequence divergence in the OMG1 B-box1 domain is primarily due to a 13-amino acid deletion close to the start of the B-box1 consensus sequence CX-------------XAXLCX2CDX3H (Fig. 7). This B-box1 deletion was observed across severalBrassicasequences nested within the OMG1 clade, but this deletion was not found in monocot OMG1, suggesting it probably occurred late in the Brassicaceae lineage. Although the OMG1 B-box2 domain is largely conserved (Fig. 8), two highly conserved consensus amino acids are different in OMG1 compared to the consensus sequence CX2CX7-10CX7CX2CX5-12H. The third cysteine in the consensus sequence is serine in OMG1 (C49S), and the histidine at the end of the consensus sequence is leucine (H73L). Examination of B-box2 domains outside the OMG1 clade suggests that these substitutions are unique to the OMG1 clade[seeSupporting Information—Fig. S3]. OMG1 resulted from a gene duplication of COL11 and 12 and underwent a subsequent B-box1 deletion event. OMG1 and CONSTANS-Like (COL) 11-12 are sister clades based on the consensus tree described inFig. 8, suggesting that OMG1 resulted from a gene duplication of COL11-12 (indicated by the circle). Sequences within the OMG1 clade are grouped intoBrassicasandmonocots. TheBrassicasequences highlighted in red, share a similar B-box1 deletion indicated by the triangle and reflected in the adjacent B-box1 domain sequences derived using the AliView software. The B-box1 consensus sequence (Gangappa and Botto 2014) is listed and regions where the deletion occurs are highlighted in blue. The consensus tree depicted here is not drawn to scale. The B-box domain family belongs to a subgroup of zinc-binding proteins stabilized by canonical cysteine-rich zinc-finger motifs (Klug and Schwabe 1995). The inferred structure of Zn-bound OMG1 B-box2 suggests that OMG1 is capable of stably binding at least one zinc ion, via a canonical zinc-finger motif (Fig. 9). In the model, four conserved cysteine residues surrounding the CX2C configuration were spatially positioned in a similar fashion as the amino acids surrounding the first Zn-binding site in the human MID1 template, suggesting this first OMG1 Zn-binding site retains a canonical zinc-finger structure. The B-box2 domain of OMG1 is predicted to bind at least one zinc ion. The sequence of B-box2 domain was compared betweenArabidopsisCOL11-12, OMG1 and the basal speciesAmborella trichopoda.The consensus sequence of the B-box2 domain is listed and OMG1 seems to have a relatively conserved B-box2 domain except for the residues highlighted in blue. Residues within the COL sequences that create a zinc-binding interface are indicated by the black lines, whereas residues that might create a second zinc-binding interface are indicated by the blue lines. The human MID1 sequence is also listed and residues that bind to the first zinc ion are highlighted in pink, whereas residues that bind to the second zinc ion are highlighted in blue. OMG1 B-box2 domain was modelled after a well-characterized B-box2 found in the Human MID1 protein located in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Modelling of the protein was done using the Chimera protein modelling software. In theArabidopsisOMG1 protein, four cysteines are positioned such that they interact with a zinc ion. However, the substitution of amino acids around the second zinc-binding region shows strong evidence for the loss of the second Zn-binding site as modelled in the human MID1 template. However, radical substitutions at key Zn-binding sites (C49S, E52Q, C67I and H73L) occurring in the second Zn-binding pocket of OMG1’s B-box2 motif appear to completely disrupt potential Zn-binding (Fig. 9). It remains unclear whether the series of indels and substitutions after the OMG1 B-box2 domain could result in a novel structure that facilitates zinc ion binding or a different functional motif. Furthermore, sequences within the OMG1 clade show similar substitutions at most of these conserved Zn-binding residues, implicating the possibility that functional B-box2 in these proteins require only a single Zn ion[seeSupporting Information—Fig. S3]. The transient expression of a 35S::OMG1-eGFP fusion protein in tobacco leaves indicates that OMG1 localizes in the nucleus. The highly conserved CCT domain in OMG1 has been associated with important functions in transcriptional regulation, DNA binding and nuclear localization (Robsonet al.2001;Yanet al.2011;Gendronet al.2012). Cells transformed with 35S::eGFP alone displayed a uniform expression of eGFP throughout the leaf pavement cells in the vacuoles, nucleus and membrane. However, cells transformed with 35S::OMG1-eGFP fusion were specifically localized to the nucleus, as indicated by the DAPI nuclei-specific counter stain (Fig. 10). OMG1 has a conserved CCT domain and localizes in the nucleus. (A) The sequence of CCT domain was compared betweenArabidopsisCOL11-12, OMG1 and the basal speciesAmborella trichopoda.OMG1 has a conserved CCT domain (consensus sequence in black) that encodes a nuclear localization signal (highlighted in red). (B) Subcellular localization using leaves of 4-week-oldNicotiana benthamianaseedlings that were transiently transformed withAgrobacterium-GV3101 carrying the At1g05290cds-eGFP fusion vector or the pCAMBIA1302 (as an overexpressing eGFP control) indicated that OMG1 is localized solely in the nucleus and exhibits no presence elsewhere in the cell. DAPI stains for the nucleus and can be seen to overlap with the eGFP expression. Scale bars: 100 µm. As sessile organisms, plants have developed sensitive, adaptive strategies to regulate their metabolism in a changing environment (Noctoret al.2007;Schwarzländer and Finkemeier 2012). A strategy to avoid oxidative damage relies on the ability to deploy different antioxidants and ROS-scavenging/detoxifying enzymes to efficiently adjust their redox states. When subjected to the novel environment of spaceflight, plants respond by overexpressing more ROS- or redox-associated genes than comparable plants on the ground (Imet al.2011;Paulet al.2012b,2013b,2017;Correllet al.2013;Sugimotoet al.2014). ROS in its various forms and subcellular production sites can elicit distinct and diverse physiological, biochemical and molecular responses (Mittleret al.2004;Gadjevet al.2006;Swanson and Gilroy 2010;Suzukiet al.2012). It is possible that plants drew from diverse ROS response strategies to cope with spaceflight, an environment that is outside their evolutionary experience and therefore potentially stressful. The data presented here suggest thatOMG1is a putative regulator of the ROS signalling pathway associated with wounding and may play a prominent role in regulating the spaceflight ROS response, especially in the WS ecotype where it is strongly induced by spaceflight. Spaceflight induces the differential expression of ROS-producing genes in an ecotype-dependent manner Previous morphological differences between Col-0 and WS ecotypes in the spaceflight environment were primarily observed in the roots. Although the overall root length at 11 days on orbit between the two ecotypes showed no significant difference (Paulet al.2017), it was noted that the Col-0 ecotype showed a dramatic lag in root development during the first 48-h post-germination in orbit when compared to the WS ecotype, and that there are also ecotype-specific differences in root growth behaviour (Paulet al.2012a). One difference between the Col-0 and WS ecotypes is the regulation of class III peroxidase genes (Passardiet al.2007). In fact, two genesPE10(AT1G49570) andPE59(AT5G19890) that were up-regulated in the APEX03-2 Col-0 but remained unchanged in APEX03-2 WS (Fig. 1B) are involved in controlling the root cell elongation process (Markakiset al.2012). The differentially expressed peroxidase genes between the two ecotypes in the APEX03-2 spaceflight transcriptomes (Fig. 1B) reinforce the notion that different ecotypes utilize ROS differently to respond to their environment and suggest that in WS, these genes were already at a level appropriate for spaceflight acclimation and were therefore unchanged. In addition, the observed down-regulation of peroxidases in Col-0 was consonant with observations previously published (Kwonet al.2015). Since peroxidases are necessary for the general oxidoreduction of H2O2in general, the down-regulation of peroxidases in spaceflight within Col-0 could contribute to Col-0-specific ROS signatures seen in clusters A and B of the ROSMETER analyses (Fig. 1A). OMG1 transcript is consistently up-regulated in WS ecotype across multiple spaceflight experiments and is induced rapidly upon wounding in both WS and Col-0 OMG1is consistently induced in spaceflight in WS but not Col-0. Comparisons of the 5′ upstream region, the coding region and the 3′ UTR ofOMG1between the two ecotypes showed no differences in the primary sequence. However, in the intergenic region downstream of theOMG1stop codon, a point mutation is observed at positions 2197, 3327, and a two-nucleotide deletion is observed at position 3488[seeSupporting Information—Fig. S4]. The WS and Col-0 ecotypes are genotypically distinct, and their transcriptomic responses to environmental and developmental cues can be dissimilar (e.g.Chenet al.2005;Kusunokiet al.2017). The overall spaceflight transcriptomes of WS and Col-0 are dramatically different (Paulet al.2017). It is hypothesized that even though OMG1 is functional in both ecotypes upon wounding, other gene products or pathways present in Col-0 but not WS could compensate for the ‘need’ for OMG1 in space, or that these genes were already at a level appropriate for spaceflight acclimation and were therefore unchanged in the spaceflight transcriptome. Although OMG1’s role in the physiological adaptation of WS to spaceflight has yet to be discerned, its strong induction suggests that OMG1 contributes to a successful adjustment to that environment. Irrespective of OMG1’s specific role in spaceflight physiology, it is noteworthy that OMG1’s overall metabolic function, which was previously unknown, was only discovered because of its role in spaceflight physiology. OMG1 is associated with the regulation of ROS OMG1is associated with ROS regulation. The location ofOMG1promoter region activity coincided with regions of dynamic ROS activity.OMG1specifically regulated the expression of two ROS-associated genes (GRX480andMYB77). And, loss of OMG1 protein inomg1resulted in deviations from WT in two different ROS assays. The rapid induction ofOMG1expression immediately after wounding was observed with a promoter-driven GUS reporter qRT-PCR analysis. Rapid induction of transcription (prior to 2-min post-stimulus) has been observed in gravitational and mechanical stimulation ofArabidopsisroot apical tissues (Kimbroughet al.2004). In addition, woundingArabidopsisleaves produces ROS within minutes at the wound site (Milleret al.2009;Beneloujaephajriet al.2013) and this rapid response is necessary for plants to elicit immediate defence/repair mechanisms against herbivore and pathogen attacks. Wounded plants can transmit rapid RBOHD-dependent ROS signals of speeds up to 8.4 cm min−1to mediate long-distance cell-to-cell communication (Milleret al.2009). However, since no statistical differences were seen in the expression level ofRbohDin Col-0 WT plants andomg1KO plants (Fig. 6D), this suggests that the changes in extracellular or intracellular ROS are not a result of altered expression ofRbohDin theomg1KO line. Reactive oxygen species molecules are essential signalling molecules in plant growth and development but can also act as toxic stressors. Therefore, there exists an elaborate and highly redundant network of genes that maintain the delicate ROS homeostasis (Gechevet al.2006). Functional OMG1 is necessary for rapid generation of intracellular ROS at the wound site (Fig. 6AandB). However, over time these ROS return to WT levels, presumably facilitated by other genes of redundant function[seeSupporting Information—Fig. S6]. In a recent review, it has been suggested that altered ROS signalling in response to the spaceflight environment could affect plant growth and development indirectly via changes in hormonal influx within the plants (Schüleret al.2015). OMG1 was found to regulate the expression of ROS-associated genesGRX480andMYB77. GRX480/GRXC9 is a member of the glutaredoxin (GRX) family of small redox enzymes. GRX480 is a salicylic acid (SA)-responsive gene induced quickly and transiently by an NPR1-independent pathway, which is associated with the ROS-scavenging/antioxidant network (Laporteet al.2012;Zanderet al.2012;Herrera-Vásquezet al.2015a;Huanget al.2016).MYB77is a member of the R2R3-type transcription factor family that is involved in ROS metabolism through the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. The MAPK cascade is also known to play a role in plant development and hormone signalling and includes hormones such as jasmonic acid (JA), SA and ethylene (ET) (Shin and Schachtman 2004;Teigeet al.2004;Galvez-Valdiviesoet al.2009;Herrera-Vásquezet al.2015b). Phylogeny and protein architecture of OMG1 Prior to this study, members of theArabidopsisCO and COL family were thought to only function in photoperiod signalling that involves flowering, circadian rhythms, stomata opening and root-shoot branching (Gangappa and Botto 2014). Evidence presented here suggests that members of this family play a role in ROS signalling. This, in turn, could aid in the functional characterization of many of the other uncharacterized members such as COL11 and COL12. We suggest that divergent function of OMG1 can be attributed to the evolved B-box1 and B-box2 domains. This is in line with reports on the rapid evolution of COL genes within the Brassicaceae, in which the increased evolutionary rates were observed not only in the middle region of the protein but also in the conserved zinc-finger and basic CCT regions (Lagercrantz and Axelsson 2000).
