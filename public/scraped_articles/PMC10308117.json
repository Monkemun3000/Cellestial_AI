The genusCohnella(familyPaenibacillaceae, orderBacillales, phylum Firmicutes/Bacillota) was first proposed by Kampfer et al. (2006) as distinct from the genusPaenibacillus, with the description ofCohnella thermotolerans(type species, isolated during hygiene checks at a starch production company in Sweden) and the reclassification ofPaenibacillus hongkongensisasCohnella hongkongensis(Teng et al.,2003).Cohnellaspecies are differentiated fromPaenibacillusdue to high iso-C16:0content in their fatty acid profiles (Kampfer et al.,2006). Members ofCohnellaare rod-shaped, usually endospore-forming, and gram-positive. Cohnellaspecies have been first isolated from a wide variety of environmental samples, most usually in soil (Kampfer et al.,2014), but also in plant tissue (Garcia-Fraile et al.,2008; Flores-Felix et al.,2014) and compost heaps (He et al.,2013). Species from this genus are used in industrial applications including fermentation, biofuel production, and wastewater treatment bioreactors (Lin et al.,2020; Hero et al.,2021; Chen et al.,2022; Mohammadi et al.,2022). As with the genusPaenibacillus, many members of the genusCohnellaare strongly associated with the plant rhizosphere environment, particularly that of legume species (Niang et al.,2018). Multiple novelCohnellaspecies have been discovered in the root nodules of leguminous plants, although only two species are known to fix nitrogen (Garcia-Fraile et al.,2008; Wang et al.,2012,2015; Flores-Felix et al.,2014; Takada et al.,2019).Cohnellaspecies are also thought to play an important role in recycling plant biomass within soil, with multiple members of the genus possessing genes for degradation of hemicellulose, cellulose, and xylan (Khianngam et al.,2010; Hameed et al.,2013; Hero et al.,2021; Johnson et al.,2021). Overall, whileCohnellaspecies have been occasionally detected in the blood and oral cavities of immune-compromised or otherwise unhealthy individuals (Teng et al.,2003; Abou Abdallah et al.,2019; Kim et al.,2021), they do not appear to be common human commensals. In this study, we completed the characterization study of strain F6_2S_P_1Tand describe it here with three main objectives. The first objective was to establishCohnellasp. F6_2S_P_1Tas a novel species, for which chemotaxonomic, phenotypic, phylogenetic (using taxonomic marker genes), and comparative genomic analyses were carried out. In addition, initial taxonomic analysis for strain F6_2S_P_1Tshowed that it was most closely related to fourCohnellaspecies without publicly available genomes, two of which are officially recognized species (Kim et al.,2010; Kampfer et al.,2014). Thus, the strainsCohnella ginsengisoliDSM 18997TandCohnella rhizosphaeraeDSM 28161Twere acquired from the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (DSMZ) and whole-genome-sequenced, and assembled draft genomes were generated for these species. The second objective was to discover the phylogenetic placement of strain F6_2S_P_1Twithin the genusCohnella, for which we performed multiple phylogenetic analyses as well as a pangenome, and a genome-based tree containing all shared single-copy core genes from the genusCohnella. The third objective was to explore the functional traits predicted by the genome of strain F6_2S_P_1T. Because strain F6_2S_P_1Tis part of a branch of the genusCohnellawhich is only distantly related to the rest of the genus, the functional traits predicted for the entire closely related clade of which strain F6_2S_P_1Tis a member were characterized. Sample collection and isolation Upon delivery to Jet Propulsion Laboratory, ISS wipes and unopened control wipes were processed for the isolation of environmental microbes within a 12-h period. Each wipe was placed in a sterile 500-ml bottle with 200-ml sterile PBS and shaken vigorously for 2 min. PBS was then concentrated using an Innovaprep CP-150 (Innovaprep LLC, Drexel, Missouri, United States) with a 0.2 μm polysulfone hollow fiber concentrating pipette tip (Innovaprep LLC, SKU CC08022-10). Using additional sterile PBS, dilutions of 10−1through 10−6were prepared and plated onto Reasoner's 2 agar (R2A, BD Diagnostics Cat # 218263), potato dextrose agar (BD Diagnostics Cat #213400) with 0.05 g/L chloramphenicol, and blood agar (Hardy Diagnostics, #A10) media. Five colonies from each sample on each media type were selected and stored in one-tenth strength tryptic soy agar (TSA) stabs. Strain F6_2S_P_1Twas isolated from blood agar inoculated with the PBS concentrate from Location 2 (wall behind WHC), collected during Flight 6 (third flight in the Microbial Tracking 2 mission series). DNA extraction and whole-genome sequencing The ZymoBIOMICS DNA MagBead kit was used to extract genomic DNA from strain F6_2S_P_1Taccording to the manufacturer's instructions. An Illumina Nextera DNA Flex library preparation kit was used to prepare the library for WGS as in Simpson et al. (2021b). The library was sequenced as part of a run on a NovaSeq 6000 S4 flow cell paired-end 2 × 150-bp platform. FastQC v0.11.7 (Bioinformatics,2011) was used to quality filter and trim reads, and fastp v0.20 (Chen et al.,2018) was used to remove adapter sequences. A draft genome was assembled to the scaffold level using SPAdes v3.11.1 (Bankevich et al.,2012). Assembly quality, including number of contigs, genome size, and N50 value, was assessed using QUAST v5.0.2 (Gurevich et al.,2013). Default settings were used for all steps except for fastp, which included 512 adapters screening. A secondary round of sequencing for strain F6_2S_P_1T, as well asC. ginsengisoliDSM 18997TandC. rhizosphaeraeDSM 28161T, was conducted using Oxford Nanopore sequencing.C. ginsengisoliDSM 18997TandC. rhizosphaeraeDSM 28161Twere ordered from the DSMZ and cryostocks prepared for long term storage. To produce a more resolved genome forCohnellasp. F6_2S_P_1Tand to provide WGS, all strains were re-streaked from cryostock on TSA and genomic DNA was extracted using a Zymo QuikSpin DNA extraction kit. Nanopore sequencing libraries were prepared using an SQK-LSK110 Ligation Sequencing kit (Oxford Nanopore) and sequenced on an R9.4.1 flow cell, with base calling via MinKNOW/Guppy. Porechop (Wick et al.,2017a) and Nanofilt (De Coster et al.,2018) were used to remove adapter sequences and filter reads using the settings “-q 10 -l 200.” A hybrid genome assembly forCohnellasp. F6_2S_P_1Twas generated via Unicycler (Wick et al.,2017b) using Nanopore reads to polish the Illumina assembly. Flye (Kolmogorov et al.,2019) followed by polishing with Medaka (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) was used to assemble draft genomes for type strains ofC. ginsengisoliandC. rhizosphaeraefrom Nanopore reads, and assembly quality was assessed using QUAST v5.0.2 (Gurevich et al.,2013). Phylogenetic analysis using 16S rRNA gene sequences was carried out by extracting the 16S rDNA sequence from the WGS of strain F6_2S_P_1Tand aligning it to the NCBI nucleotide database via blast search. The top 30 matching 16S rRNA sequences were retrieved. In addition, all publicly available genomes from the genusCohnellawere downloaded, and their 16S rDNA sequences were extracted using a blast wrapper script. 16S rRNA genes from the speciesPaenibacillus barengoltzii, Paenibacillus terrae, Thermoflavimicrobial dichotomicus, andThermoactinomyces vulgariswere used to root the tree. Similarly, gyrB sequences from strain F6_2S_P_1Tand from all publicly availableCohnellagenomes, and the outgroupsT. dichotomicus and T. vulgariswere extracted with the same wrapper script. For both gyrB and 16S trees, alignment was performed in R using the DECIPHER package (Wright,2016). Trimming and tree-building using maximum likelihood and the substitution model GTR + G + I were performed using the phangorn package, including model selection using AIC values and 1,000 bootstrap replicates (Schliep,2011). Phylogenetic trees based on 16S rRNA and gyrB genes were visualized using ggtree (Yu et al.,2017). Additionally, average nucleotide identity (ANI) and digital DNA–DNA hybridization (dDDH) were calculated for strain F6_2S_P_1Tagainst all sequenced and describedCohnellaspecies using fastANI v1.33 (Jain et al.,2018) and DSMZ's online Genome-to-Genome Distance Calculator v3.0 (Meier-Kolthoff et al.,2022). A liquid culture of strain F6_2S_P_1Twas incubated at 80°C for 10 min, then plated on R2A and grown at 30°C for 5 days to induce endospore formation. Endospore staining with malachite green and safranin was performed using the Schaeffer–Fulton method (Schaeffer and Fulton,1933). Light microscopy and phase contrast images were taken on an Olympus BX53 microscope with an Olympus DP25 camera using Olympus cellSens software. To prepare a colony of strain F6_2S_P_1Tfor SEM, the strain was streaked out on TSA and allowed to grow at 30°C for 48 h. A pure colony was then suspended in chilled 2.5% glutaraldehyde (Ted Pella Inc., Redding, CA, United States) in 0.1M sodium cacodylate (NaCaco) (Sigma Aldrich) solution for 1 h. The sample was then filtered through a 0.2 μm Isopore filter membrane (MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA, United States) and moved into a 1.5 ml centrifuge tube. The sample was then incubated in 0.1 M NaCaco solution at 4°C for 10 min and then replaced with fresh 0.1 M NaCaco solution; this replacement was repeated three times. The sample was then dehydrated in a series of increasing IPA solutions mixed with water for 10 min each. The series was 50, 70, 80, 90, 95, and 100%, with the final 100% IPA rinsing occurring three times. The specimen was stored at 4°C in 100% IPA until it was critical point dried in a Tousimis Automegasamdri 915B critical point dryer (Rockville, MD, United States). Samples were adhered with carbon tape to SEM stubs (Ted Pella Inc.) and then underwent ~12 nm thick carbon coating with a Leica EM ACE600 Carbon Evaporator (Deerfield, IL, United States). SEM micrographs were captured on a FEI Quanta 200F microscope (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, United States) located at the California Institute of Technologies Kavli Nanoscience Institute. Pangenomic analysis and other genome characterization The genome of the strain F6_2S_P_1Twas also uploaded and annotated using the online Rapid Annotation using Subsystems Technology (RAST platform) (Aziz et al.,2008). The presence of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) which might produce secondary metabolites was predicted in the strain F6_2S_P_1Tgenome using the antiSMASH pipeline (Blin et al.,2021). The presence of antimicrobial resistance or virulence genes was predicted by the ABRicate pipeline (Seemann,2018). Growth temperature was determined by inoculating both solid (R2A plates) and liquid (trypticase soy broth (TSB), BD Diagnostics Cat # 257107) media in 15 ml loose-capped centrifuge tubes with strain F6_2S_P_1Tand growing at 4, 15, 25, 30, 37, and 45°C. Plates and tubes were checked for growth daily for 7 days and incubation was halted if growth was observed. Samples grown at 4 and 15°C were incubated for additional time before final growth assessment: 2 weeks total for growth at 15°C and 4 weeks total at 4°C. Salt tolerance was determined by inoculating strain F6_2S_P_1Tonto R2A with 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5% added NaCl, as well as agar containing only peptone plus 0 or 1% NaCl, and examining growth after 7 days of incubation at 30°C. Oxidase activity was determined by testing solid culture with OxiDrops™ liquid oxidase reagent (Hardy Diagnostics). Catalase activity was determined by mixing colonies of strain F6_2S_P_1Twith hydrogen peroxide on a sterile glass slide and monitoring for the presence of effervescence. pH tolerance (4–10) was tested by adjusting the pH of TSB broth with biological buffers as in Xu et al. (2005). Mapping of metagenomic reads to genome Metagenomic reads from ISS surfaces from Microbial Tracking 1 (Checinska Sielaff et al.,2019) and Microbial Tracking 2 (Urbaniak et al.,2022) were mapped to the genome ofCohnellasp. F6_2S_P_1Tusing Bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg,2012), using the flags “—no-mixed” (no unpaired alignments) and “—no-discordant” (only matches where both forward and reverse reads map to the same area are considered). The number of matches where both a forward and reverse read mapped to theCohnellasp. F6_2S_P_1Tgenome were reported as a percentage of total reads. Cells grown in TSB medium were harvested when growth of the cultures reached approximately 70% of the maximal optical density (exponential growth phase) and used for analysis of cellular fatty acids, polar lipids, and quinones, which was done as described previously (Ramaprasad et al.,2015). In brief, for cellular fatty acids analysis, 40 mg of bacterial cells were subjected to a series of four different reagents followed by saponification and methylation of fatty acids, thus enabling their cleavage from lipids. The fatty acid methyl esters thus obtained were analyzed by gas chromatography. The peaks obtained were then labeled and the equivalent chain length values were computed as published elsewhere (MIDI,2012). Cohnellasp. F6_2S_P_1Tisolated from the ISS was subjected to polyphasic taxonomic characterization to determine its phylogenetic affiliation. In addition, WGSs ofC. ginsengisoliandC. rhizosphaeraewere generated and compared with the genome ofCohnellasp. F6_2S_P_1Tto identify the variable, conserved, and distinctive genomic traits.

The quinone system contained menaquinones MK-7 (98%) and MK-8 (2%). The cell-wall peptidoglycan of strain F6_2S_P_1Tcontained meso-diaminopimelic acid as the diamino acid, which is the case for other described members of theC. ginsengisoliclade where that data are reported. All other described members of theC. ginsengisoliclade also contain MK-7 as the dominant menaquinone (Kim et al.,2010; Kampfer et al.,2014; Wang et al.,2015). Descriptions ofC. capsiciandC.plantaginisdo not report low abundance menaquinones, but the quinone system of F6_2S_P_1Tis similar to that ofC. rhizosphaerae(99.8% MK-7, 0.2% MK-8), whileC. ginsengisolihas 93% MK-7 and 7% MK-6. Comparative genomic analysis ofC. hashimotonisand theC. ginsengisoliclade Pangenomic analysis of the genusCohnella, including C. hashimotonis sp. nov. (pink) as well as its previously unsequenced closest relatives C. rhizosphaerae (blue) and C. ginsengisoli (green). BecauseC. capsiciandC. plantaginisare both characterized as fixing N2, the annotations for the genome of strain F6_2S_P_1Twere searched extensively for genes having to do with nitrogen fixation, as well as blastn and blastx searches for key genes involved in N2fixation. However, despite the presence of the gene nifU in most species of the genusCohnella, there was no indication that strain F6_2S_P_1Tencodes for N2fixation. Other genes of interest predicted by annotation on the RAST platform include multiple genes for endospore formation and for the plant growth hormone auxin, genes which are likely shared by many members of the genusCohnella, which belongs to the orderBacillales(including many known spore formers) and which are common plant endophytes. BGCs which might produce secondary metabolites were predicted in the genome of strain F6_2S_P_1Tvia the antiSMASH pipeline, including two lassopeptides, two non-ribosomal peptide synthetase clusters, one agrD-like cyclic lactone autoinducer peptide, one protein cluster, and one heterocyst glycolipid synthase-like polyketide synthase. All are uncharacterized except the two lassopeptides; these are moderate matches to the lasso peptide paeninodin which was characterized from the speciesPaenibacillus dendritiformis(Zhu et al.,2016). Paeninodin and BGCs showing similarity to it have been predicted in multipleBacillusandPaenibacillusendophyte species and are suspected to have biocontrol properties that combat plant pathogens (Muñoz et al.,2022; Semenzato et al.,2022). The genomes ofC. ginsengisoli, C. rhizosphaerae, and strain F6_2S_P_1Tall contained 2–3 predicted BGCs for paeninodin, withC. ginsengisolicontaining one that is a 100% match, whileC. nanjingensis(the most closely related species outside theC. ginsengisoliclade) contained a single paeninodin match. The only other match in any of these species to a known BGC is a predicted cluster in theC. rhizosphaeraewhich is a moderate match to ectoine. Other differences include multiple cyclic lactone autoinducer peptide BGCs predicted in the genome ofC. nanjingensis(vs. a single one in all other tested genomes), and a siderophore predicted in the genome ofC. rhizosphaerae. Strain F6_2S_P_1Twas the only genome in the genusCohnellawhich a heterocyst glycolipid synthase-like polyketide synthase was detected; these BGCs are used by cyanobacteria to compartmentalize N2fixation and are activated in low-nitrogen conditions (Campbell et al.,1997), but as strain F6_2S_P_1Tdoes not contain a full suite of genes for N2fixation and the cluster is not a strong match, it is likely a producer of some kind of potentially uncharacterized lipid compound. No genes for antimicrobial resistance or virulence were predicted by the ABRicate pipeline. The entire closely related branch of which strain F6_2S_P_1Tis a member, which we term theC. ginsengisoliclade (due to its basal position and status as the first officially described species within the clade), contained 322 gene clusters not found in any other publicly availableCohnellagenome. All members of this clade in addition to strain F6_2S_P_1Twere originally isolated from plant tissue or the rhizosphere environment, includingC. ginsengisoli(isolated from soil in which ginseng was grown, Kim et al.,2010),C. rhizosphaerae(isolated from healthy maize seed tissue, Kampfer et al.,2014),C. capsici(isolated fromCapsicumrhizosphere, Wang et al.,2015),C. plantaginis(isolated from plantain rhizosphere, Wang et al.,2012),Cohnellasp. OV330 (isolated from poplar rhizosphere, JGI,2015), andCohnellasp. GbtcB17 (isolated fromGinko bilobaroot tissue, Zou et al.,2021). It is speculated that strain F6_2S_P_1Tmight have originated from the plants grown in ISS. Since shotgun metagenomics of plants associated samples (tissue, water, and soil) were not available, the source of this novel strain isolated from the WHC location could not be confirmed.Cohnellawas one of the top 30 genera recently detected via 16S amplicon sequencing of plant tissue of chili peppers grown in the Advanced Plant Habitat from sterilized seeds aboard the ISS, though it was not a top genus detected in artificial soil medium (Khodadad et al.,2022).Cohnellawas also not a dominant member of the microbiome of Outredgeous lettuce grown aboard the ISS (Khodadad et al.,2020). However, since in these ISS studies, a 250-bp 16S rRNA gene amplicon was used for the microbial diversity analyses,Cohnellaspecies might have not been identified appropriately. First two axes of NMDS ordination (standardization = “range,” distance = “Bray-Curtis,” maxit = 500, k = 3, stress = 0.129, R2= 0.98) for counts of different predicted CAZymes in the genomes ofCohnellaand Paenibacillus species. Also present in the figure are CAZyme vector correlations with axes 1 and 2 (not original coordinates) via envfit/Pearson's correlation with fdr correction + p < 0.01. Species belonging to the C. ginsengisoli clade and the top 4 CAZyme families/subfamilies positively correlated with axis 2 are labeled. Most strongly associated with this axis and theC. ginsengisoliclade are the CAZyme families CBM67 and GH78, which were both identified as part of the enzyme α-L-rhamnosidase which alters flavonoids and other rhamnose-containing glycosides such as pectins in plant cell walls (Yadav et al.,2010). Flavonoids are phenolic compounds produced by plants that often have medicinal or flavorful properties. α-L-rhamnosidase cleaves terminal α-rhamnose residues and in doing so helps concentrate and improve the action of flavonoids; α-L-rhamnosidase from different bacterial species is used for many industrial applications such as improving wine aroma, sweetening fruit juice, and increasing concentration and efficacy of antibiotic and anti-cancer compounds(Xie et al.,2022). TheC. ginsengisoliclade and otherCohnellaspecies enriched in α-L-rhamnosidase enzyme modules are all confirmed or likely plant symbionts or feed on plant tissue; however, since the majority ofCohnellaandPaenibacillusspecies appear to have at least some association with plant tissue or rhizosphere, there may be additional promising applications for these particular species in processing plant medicinal or other plant phenolic compounds. CAZymes negatively associated with theC. ginsengisoliclade (and associated mainly withPaenibacillusspecies) include chitosanases (GH46 and CBM12), endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (GH85), and β-1,4-mannosyl-glycoprotein β-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GT17). Four CAZyme families associated with theC. ginsengisoliclade compared to otherCohnellaandPaenibacillusspecies had an effect size of 0.5 or greater (Kruskal–Wallis); these were maltooligosaccharide-producing α-amylases (CG13_5), chondroitin AC lyase (PL8_3), and alginate lyases (PL34 and PL14_3). Presence ofCohnellasp. F6_2S_P_1Tin ISS metagenomes Metagenomic reads from ISS surfaces, crew capsule, and ISS HEPA filter particulates (Venkateswaran et al.,2014; Checinska Sielaff et al.,2019; Urbaniak et al.,2022) were mapped to the genome of strain F6_2S_P_1T. Most metagenomes had <0.05% of reads that mapped to strain F6_2S_P_1T, with a maximum of 0.22% of reads mapping to strain F6_2S_P_1Tfor a low-read-number sample collected from the cupola of the ISS during Flight 4 of the Microbial Tracking 2 mission series. But upon examination of regions to which the metagenomic reads mapped to strain F6_2S_P_1T, 98+% of reads mapped to regions of 16S or 23S rRNA genes and were only considered significant by bowtie2 because of the conserved nature of the 16S and 23S rRNA genes. We therefore concluded that strain F6_2S_P_1Tis not dominant in the ISS environmental surfaces or air particulates collected during the Microbial Tracking 1 and 2 mission series. However, molecular microbial diversity-based examination of plant and its associated materials using culturing and metagenomics would allow NASA to trace the source of this strain, sinceCohnellaspecies were reported to produce hormones that might promote growth of plants. For example, as mentioned above,Cohnellawas an abundant genus in the microbiome of healthy plant tissue of chili plants grown aboard the ISS (Khodadad et al.,2022). Description ofCohnella hashimotonissp. nov. Cohnella hashimotonis(ha.shi.mo.to.nis. masc. n.hashimotonisnamed in honor of Professor Hideo Hashimoto, a food microbiologist from Hiroshima Univ., Japan). Cells are endospore-forming, aerobic, and gram-positive rods, 0.5–0.6 μm in width and 0.8–100+ μm in length. In addition to normal cells, elongated, spaghetti-like cells (Figures 4D,5B) are observed in light microscopy and SEM images. Colonies are translucent cream-colored, acquiring a pinkish tinge after multiple days of growth, and grow well on R2A but poorly on TSA. Growth occurs at between 15 and 37°C, between pHs 6 and 8, and from 0 to 3% NaCl. Colonies are weakly oxidase-positive and catalase-negative. This species reduces nitrate to nitrite, produces dextrin from starch, and utilizes the following carbon substrates: alanine, histidine, serine, sucrose, L-arabinose, melibiose, D-fructose, inositol, and lactose. The following substances are utilized for acid production: maltose, sucrose, D-fructose, D-ribose, N-acetyl, glucosamine, lactose, and trisodium citrate. Major fatty acids composingC. hashimotonisare anteiso-C15:0(51.7%), iso-C16:0(23.1%), and iso-C15:0(10.5%). The polar lipids are diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, three aminophospholipids, and a phospholipid. The major quinone system is menaquinones MK-7. The cell-wall peptidoglycan of strain contained meso-diaminopimelic acid as the diamino acid. C. hashimotonisis closely related toC. rhizosphaeraeandC. ginsengisolibased on 16 rRNA gene sequence similarity (<99%). However, the phylogenetic position of the strain F6_2S_P_1Twas resolved as a novel species due to gyrB sequence similarity (<94%), ANI (<89%), and dDDH (<35%) analyses with any other sequencedCohnellaspecies. GC content is 58.37%. The type strain F6_2S_P_1Twas isolated from the wall behind the Waste Hygiene Compartment, i.e., the space toilet, aboard the ISS, in 2018; its genome is available on NCBI, accession numberJAGRPV000000000. The type strain F6_2S_P_1Tis submitted to two culture collections (=NRRL B-65657Tand DSMZ 115098T). NS and KV managed the ISS strain collection and the ISS strain genome sequencing project. AS, VE, and KV conceived and designed the study. VE and AS performed the microbiological experiments and carried out the phenotypic assays. VE performed BioLog based biochemical characterization and chemotaxonomy. FK managed to coordinate in sample collection from ISS and developed sample collection protocols. CM and ND generated shotgun metagenome sequences using ONT platform. NS performed the original taxonomic analysis andde novoassembly. AS performed genomic, pangenomic, and metagenomic characterization, long-read assemblies, and light microscopy assays and wrote the manuscript. KV edited the manuscript. CP performed SEM on F6_2S_P_1T. All authors read and approved the final manuscript. The authors would like to thank Camilla Urbaniak for isolating the strain, JAXA astronaut Kanai Norishige for collecting the relevant sample aboard the ISS, the Implementation Team at NASA Ames Research Center for coordinating this effort, and Zymo Research Corp. for extracting DNA.
