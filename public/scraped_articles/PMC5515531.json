Compared with normal gravity controls alterations to growth, culture density, biofilm formation, aggregation, virulence, and changes in resistance to stress from acid, oxidative stress, heat shock, or antibiotics have been identified.2–10It is not possible to generalize or predict how a bacterial species will react to microgravity or LSMMG. An example is resistance to oxidative stress: exposure to LSMMG increased oxidative stress resistance ofPseudomonas aeruginosa11but decreased oxidative stress resistance ofStaphylococcus aureus.12Changes in the bacterial transcriptome11–14are also induced by microgravity and LSMMG, and changes to the bacterial phenotype are likely due to alterations in the bacterial transcriptome. The diverse phenotypes induced by spaceflight or LSMMG2–7highlights the need to understand more about how different species of bacteria are altered by microgravity and the importance of identifying key molecules that promote survival under the stress of microgravity. Mycobacterium marinumis a member of a family of closely related mycobacteria, most of which are pathogenic. They includeMycobacterium tuberculosis,Mycobacterium avium,andMycobacterium ulcerans.15AlthoughM. tuberculosis, the cause of human tuberculosis, live and replicate only in a host in nature,15,16M. marinumandM. aviumgrow in macrophage and aquatic environments.16M. marinumgrows at 28–35 °C and infects poikilothermic hosts such as fish and frogs, but can infect humans resulting in granulomatous skin lesions, which pathologically are identical to lesions produced by dermalM. tuberculosis. The pathogenicM. aviumcomplex, which includes the subspeciesavium,paratuberculosis,andintracellulare, has been linked with hard-to-treat non-tuberculosis human pulmonary infections in non-immunocompromised17as well as immunocompromised individuals.18 M. marinum19andM. aviumform biofilms and can grow in biofilms in water distribution systems,20taps, and showerheads. Thirty percent of biofilms tested from showerheads across the USA containedM. aviumeven though they were linked to municipal water supplies treated with chlorine.21M. aviumgrown in a biofilm is more resistant to chlorine, even when the biofilm is disrupted.22Pathogenic waterborne mycobacteria could pose a potential threat during space travel not only to astronaut health, but also to the spacecraft environment and potable water. In fact,M. aviumwas identified in water samples taken from the Russian Mir space station.23 Pathogenic bacteria that have the potential to have increased antimicrobial resistance and virulence are a concern inside spacecraft because astronauts already have a compromised immune system, especially when in space for long periods of time.24,25Uncovering the signaling pathways that result in the altered physiology of bacteria has the potential to reveal new targets for drug development or disinfection that will be essential for long space flights. There are no published studies on the effect of microgravity or LSMMG on waterborne mycobacteria. Hfq has been identified as a factor regulating microgravity gene expression inP. aeruginosa,13S. aureus,12andSalmonella entericserovar Typhimurium14(S. typhimurium), but mycobacteria do not encode Hfq.26M. marinumis closely related genetically toM. tuberculosisandM. aviumand has similar mechanisms of infection and survival inside host macrophage. Although all of these mycobacterium species can grow in specialized medium in the laboratory,27growth ofM. marinumeven at the lower temperature of 30–32 °C is faster thanM. tuberculosis27andM. avium.28M. marinumis also a lower risk (bisoafety level 2) to researchers. HenceM. marinumis a good model for pathogenic mycobacteria. The aim of this study was to identify factors involved in the adaptation ofM. marinumto the LSMMG stressful environment and determine how LSMMG alters mycobacterium physiology. Two strains ofM. marinum(1218R and LHM4) were used for this study. Strain 1218R was originally isolated from fish and LHM4 was generated from 1218R by integrating a plasmid into the genome that encodes for kanamycin resistance and the red fluorescent protein. Previous work studying the effect of LSMMG on bacteria with doubling times of <1 h exposed the bacteria to LSMMG for 10,2920,3024 h11or 10 generations.31M. marinumhas a doubling time of 6–7 h at 30 °C and hence two exposure times to LSMMG or NG (short ~40 h and long 4 days and ~35 h) were selected to allow the bacteria to undergo multiple replication cycles during the experiments. The exposure protocol was designed so that short and long LSMMG- or NG-exposed cultures were in exponential phase and hence alterations to the transcriptome or resistance to treatment with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), acid or gamma radiation were due to different exposure times to LSMMG and not due to different phases of growth. In summary, this work characterizes the growth, stress survival, and transcriptome ofM. marinumgrown under LSMMG and identifies nutrient deprivation as a signal involved in changes to gene expression and the sigma factor SigH as a factor modulating the LSMMG transcriptome in a waterborne mycobacterium. LSMMG did not alter aggregation ofM. marinum M. marinumgrown under LSMMG transition from exponential phase earlier than NG-exposedM. marinum Growth under LSMMG alters culture density ofM. marinum. LHM4 and 1218R was grown in 10 ml HARVs under NG or LSMMG for 4 days continuously and the OD600determined. The data from 13 HARVs for LHM4 and 3 HARVs for 1218R for each condition was used to obtain the average and s.d. (a). OD600was monitored for LHM4 (b) and 1218R (c) in 50 ml HARVs. At each time point, a small culture volume (1–2 ml) was removed to measure OD600and the volume replaced with fresh medium (2–4% total volume). Strain 1218R was also grown in medium with catalase (d). Three independent experiments were performed for each strain and growth condition. As data were not gathered at the exact time point in each experiment, all the data points were pooled for a strain and condition and are shown graphically (b–d). A transition from exponential phase was detected at ~37 h in LSMMG cultures compared with NG cultures. The data between 37 and 70 h for the three experiments were plotted (e,f) and regression analysis performed, demonstrating that the increase in OD600during this time period was statistically different when the bacteria were grown under NG and LSMMG (P<0.0001). As OD600can be influenced by size of the bacteria, the diameter and length of 50 bacteria in an LHM4 culture grown for 4 days under LSMMG (OD600=1.3) or NG (OD600=2.3) were determined. No statistical significant difference was found for the diameter (NG=0.72±0.05 μm, LSMMG=0.73±0.07 μm) or the length (NG=2.7±0.45 μm, LSMMG=2.7±0.5 μm) between the two cultures. M. marinumtranscriptome response to LSMMG Gene expression changes identified by RNA-Seq. Transcriptional profiles were compared between 1218R grown at LSMMG and NG for 40 h (a, LSMMG/NG) or 4 days ~35 h (b, LSMMG/NG) and between 1218R grown under LSMMG for the two time periods (c, 4 days ~35 h/40 h). The significant (P<0.05) changes in transcript levels were identified. The real fold change (RFC) is the ratio of the normalized mean count values for LSMMG divided by the normalized mean count values for NG. The genes that changed ⩾1.5-fold were assigned to categories (1–9) and the distribution of the RFC is shown graphically. No genes were significantly altered ⩾1.5-fold in the insertion sequences and phage category and so this category is not included. The mean value for the RFC for a category is marked by the black spot and the number of genes in the category is shown in parentheses. Only genes that altered significantly by ⩾1.5-fold at both time points are shown. RFC is the ratio of the normalized mean count values for LSMMG over the normalized mean count values for NG. Expression of cell metabolism genes Growth under LSMMG increases expression of genes involved in lipid degradation and mycobactin synthesis but decreases expression of genes involved in mycolic acid synthesis. Genes involved in the designated categories lipid degradation (a), mycolic acid synthesis (b) and mycobactin synthesis (c) were identified using the mycobrowser website (http://mycobrowser.epfl.ch/) and the literature.38The FPKMs (fragments per kilobase of transcript per million reads) for each gene in the 12 RNA samples were analyzed using Genesifter. Only genes with ⩾1.5-fold change in expression (P<0.05) were considered. The data were log transformed. The heat maps were generated showing expression in short (growth for ~40 h) and long (growth for 4 days ~35 h) exposure samples. Genes colored brown are discussed in the manuscript text. SigH: a possible regulator of the mycobacteria LSMMG response Changes in expression of SigH-regulated genes show a linkage to growth under LSMMG. Mehret al.41treated wild-type andsigHmutantM. tuberculosiswith diamide and determined SigH-related gene expression changes after 0 and 30 min recovery time. PeaksigHtranscript was at 30 min.M. marinumorthlogs of these genes were identified (http://mycobrowser.epfl.ch/). The FPKMs (fragments per kilobase of transcript per million reads) for each gene in the 12 RNA samples were analyzed for hierarchical clustering using GeneSifter with a threshold of 1.5-fold change and a statistical difference (P<0.05) determined using an ANOVA. The data were log transformed. The heat maps show expression changes during LSMMG and NG for the orthologs of theM. tuberculosisgenes that changed after 0 (a) and 30 min (b). Genes colored brown are discussed in the text. Changes in expression of genes related to the enduring hypoxic response and the nutrient starvation response The effect of LSMMG on genes involved in the enduring hypoxic response (EHR) or nutrient starvation response. Genes involved in these two stress responses have been identified inM. tuberculosis.42,43TheM. marinumorthologs were identified (http://mycobrowser.epfl.ch/) for the EHR (a) andrelAnutrient starvation (b) response43(Supplemental Data Set 1 and section 3 in ref.43). The FPKMs (fragments per kilobase of transcript per million reads) for each gene in the 12 RNA samples were analyzed for hierarchical clustering using GeneSifter with a threshold of 1.5-fold change and a statistical difference (P<0.05) determined using an ANOVA analysis. The data were log transformed. Genes colored brown are discussed in the text. Comparison ofM. marinumexposed to LSMMG andP. aeruginosaexposed to spaceflight or LSMMG Transcriptome data therefore suggest thatM. marinumgrown under LSMMG exhibit similar stress responses as LSMMG-grownP. aeruginosa, but have transcriptional, translational, and metabolic alterations similar to spaceflight-exposedP. aeruginosa. Survival of LHM4 NG- and LSMMG-exposed cultures to stressful conditions LHM4 grown under LSMMG are more sensitive to H2O2but not gamma radiation or acid in comparison with NG cultures. Bacteria were grown in HARVs under LSMMG or NG for ~40 h (short exposure time) or 4 days ~35 h (long exposure time). Cultures were removed and treated with gamma radiation using a137Cesium source (a), H2O2(b), or growth medium at pH 3.5 (c). Bacteria were grown on solid medium and colonies counted. The percent survival was calculated by dividing the colony number/ml by that obtained for a culture treated with no dose at the same time. At least three experiments were performed for each culture and treatment type, except for the short exposure time LSMMG and NG cultures treated with H2O2where two experiments were performed. The average and s.d. are shown. Survival was compared between the LSMMG and NG samples using the area under the curve and the only statistically significant difference was between the long exposure LSMMG culture and the long exposure NG culture treated with H2O2(*P=0.004). Previous studies examining liquid bacterial growth during space travel3or LSMMG2,3have found species-specific alterations: LSMMG-grownS. typhimuriumhad decreased doubling time in minimal medium,29Escherichia coliandBacillus subtilisreached higher cell densities and had increased growth rate during spaceflight compared with ground controls,45whileS. aureusachieved higher cell densities in the normal gravity control compared with the LSMMG culture.12In our study, in a 4-day continuous growth culture,M. marinumsubjected to NG achieved a higher cell density than the LSMMG culture. As the size of the bacteria did not change and aggregates were disrupted before optical density measurements were determined, the lower LSMMG cell density was likely due to an alteration in growth. A more detailed examination of the growth indicated an early transition of the LSMMG bacteria from exponential phase resulting in a slowing of growth. Even though RNA-Seq analysis was performed at the point where this transition was just detectable, the slowing of growth is apparent from changes in the transcriptome. MA synthesis is linked to new membrane synthesis and cell wall expansion38and is needed for bacterial cell division, and MA synthesis gene transcript levels decreased ~3-fold under LSMMG. During exponential growth there is also a linear relationship between bacterial growth rate and the number of ribosomes in a cell.46The slower growing LSMMGM. marinumculture had ~2-fold reduction in transcripts of multiple ribosomal proteins, indicating a downregulation of translation.P. aeruginosa13andS. typhimurium14cultured during spaceflight also had decreased ribosomal protein transcripts, but growth studies were not performed for these bacteria. Transcriptome changes imply a nutrient-deprived environment under LSMMG Key bacterial metabolic pathways include β-oxidation of fatty acids, ETC, TCA, and the methylcitrate and glyoxylate cycles.35In LSMMGM. marinum, a number of genes encoding enzymes involved in lipid degradation increased expression, buticltranscript levels decreased ~10-fold after long exposure to LSMMG. Icl converts isocitrate into glyoxylate, and glyoxylate combined with acetyl CoA from β oxidation of fatty acids produces malate for the glyoxylate cycle.35Also transcript levels decreased 3–6-fold in LSMMGM. marinumfor the WhiB3 transcription regulator, which is implicated in the adaptation of mycobacteria to growth on long-chain fatty acids.48The transcriptome data therefore suggest energy generation from fatty acids was depressed in LSMMGM. marinum. Decreased transcript levels of genes encoding Sdh2 and aconitase suggest that ETC, TCA, and the methylcitrate and glyoxylate cycles are depressed in LSMMGM. marinum. Sdh2 is an enzyme that is essential for growth and Sdh1 cannot substitute for all activities of Sdh2 (ref.49), which links oxidative phosphorylation energy production to carbon metabolism.36Succinate oxidation generates electrons for ETC, but in mycobacteria proline oxidation can substitute for succinate oxidation under carbon starvation and slow growth conditions.36The transcriptome data indicate thatM. marinumincreased proline oxidation under LSMMG; transcript levels increased for proline oxidation enzymes when transcript levels from the Sdh2 genes decreased. Sdh1 and 2 levels inMycobacterium smegmatishave been linked to energy availability and oxygen levels: under energy-limiting conditions Sdh2 is downregulated and Sdh1 is upregulated, and this is reversed under oxygen-limiting conditions.36Even though in our study, the genes encoding Sdh1 did not alter expression significantly, the transcript changes for Sdh2 and the proline oxidation enzymes suggest that LSMMGM. marinumcould still produce energy by ETC, and were sensing a carbon-starved/energy-limiting environment. Even though there were LSMMG-linked transcript alterations related toM. tuberculosisEHR, the metabolic transcriptome data does not suggest the LSMMGM. marinumwere under hypoxia. Many of the EHR genes that changed were stress response genes and includedsigH, chaperone and heat-shock-regulated genes. SigH is one of 18 sigma factors inM. marinum53and sigma factors function in promoter sequence recognition; directing initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase.54sigHwas the only sigma factor gene to increase expression under LSMMG at both the short and long exposure times. Transcript levels of genes regulated directly or indirectly by SigH also changed significantly due to LSMMG exposure. SigH autoregulates its expression by binding to its own promoter and increasing transcription, and SigH is post-translationally regulated by RshA and PknB. RshA binds to SigH and prevents SigH from binding to RNA polymerase and SigH-RshA binding is disrupted by heat or redox stress,55as well as phosphorylation by PknB.56Small/no changes were detected inrshAandpknBtranscript levels in LSMMGM. marinum, but conditions inside the LSMMG mycobacteria could have induced a substantial activity change in SigH by disrupting binding to RshA. A 1.5-fold increase in thesigHtranscript is implicated in the 40-fold increase inhsptranscript after long exposure to LSMMG. SigH is known to be involved in the response of mycobacteria to oxidative stress as well as heat shock. ThereforeM. marinumexposed to LSMMG would be expected to be resistant to H2O2. AlgU is another alternate sigma factor involved in heat shock and oxidative stress that has been implicated in the LSMMG response ofP. aeruginosa11and LSMMG-exposedP. aeruginosawere more resistant to H2O2treatment.11However, LSMMG-exposed LHM4 were more sensitive to H2O2in our study. LHM4 was derived from 1218R by integration of an RFP-expressing plasmid (pDEAM2) at theattBsite in the genome. TheattBsite is used to integrate plasmids into mycobacterium, as integration does not disrupt any genes.58Previous studies have demonstrated that aM. marinumstrain similar to LHM4 that was derived by pDEAM2 integration into 1218R had similar growth characteristics and virulence in Medaka fish to 1218R.59We also determined that LHM4 and 1218R had similar growth characteristics under LSMMG. Therefore, LSMMG-exposed 1218R would be expected to be sensitive to H2O2. Interestingly,S. aureus,S. typhimurium,E. coli,Enterobacter cloacae, andCitrobacter freundiigrown under LSMMG have also been found to be more sensitive to H2O2than NG controls.12,60A second group usingS. typhimuriumdid find that LSMMG induced resistance to H2O2and that resistance involved induction of catalase.30Sensitivity to H2O2could be altered by the availability of detoxification enzymes (catalase and alkyl hydroperoxidases), proteins involved in ‘repairing’ oxidized proteins (thioredoxins and methionine sulfoxide reductases) or redox buffers such as mycothiol and ergothioneine.51Transcript levels of the genes encoding these proteins or the enzymes involved in the synthesis of mycothiol and ergothioneine did not significantly decrease in LSMMGM. marinum, which suggests these protection mechanisms were not compromised compared with the NG control. In fact, transcriptome data indicate that thetrxB1transcript, which encodes one of the thioredoxins, increased by 4-fold after the long exposure time. Cysteine, which is key to many of the protecting enzymes/compounds, was also being conserved and production increased: the transcript of cysteine desulfurase decreased by 2-fold after LSMMG exposure and thecysK2transcript increased ~4-fold after the long exposure to LSMMG. Even though LSMMGM. marinumwere more sensitive to H2O2, they had no change in sensitivity to killing by ionizing radiation compared with the NG control. Ionizing radiation and H2O2are similar in that they both induce oxidative stress and generate similar types of DNA damage61and DNA is a critical target in cells for cell killing. Lack of enhanced killing by radiation suggests the increased sensitivity to H2O2was due to a different mechanism of radical formation/ cell killing by H2O2in LSMMG bacteria that could not be defended against by the SigH response. In mycobacteria, the outer cell wall is the first line of defense against H2O2. This is not the case for ionizing radiation. Ionizing radiation deposits energy in the molecules of the cell and generates DNA damage by depositing energy directly on the DNA or by depositing energy in water, which produces hydroxyl radicals that then induce DNA damage.62The energy deposited by the radiation can also generate lipid peroxides and oxidation of protein molecules, but the delivery of the energy to the macromolecules is not impeded by the structures surrounding or within the bacterium. Therefore, ionizing radiation energy deposition and DNA damage production will occur even if the cell wall composition changes. H2O2can pass through lipid bilayers but is broken down to hydroxyl radicals by the Fenton reaction, which requires Fe2+(ref.63). The hydroxyl radicals can generate lipid peroxides from reaction with lipids in the cell wall that can diffuse and generate DNA damage.64The composition of the cell wall and the iron content of the cell could therefore modify radical formation and alter the sensitivity of the cell to H2O2. There were a substantial number of transcript changes in LSMMGM. marinumrelated to the cell wall. Transcripts of genes related to MA and phenolic glycolipid synthesis were decreased, while transcripts encoding proteins involved in modifying the types of MA were increased. LSMMG-exposedM. marinumalso had an increase in transcripts related to mycobactin synthesis and mycobactins bind iron from the environment and transport the charged iron across the hydrophobic cell wall.39An increase in mycobactin synthesis could therefore increase iron content in the mycobacterium. Alterations to mycobactin synthesis and to the composition of the mycobacterium cell wall could therefore explain why the LSMMG-exposed mycobacterium, even with thesigHoperon response, were more sensitive to H2O2but not ionizing radiation. The changes at the cell wall did not sensitize the LSMMGM. marinumto pH 3.5 and so cell wall lipid composition may not influence acid resistance. Other bacteria exposed to LSMMG have also been found not to have increased sensitivity to killing by acid60even though they were more sensitive to H2O2. Recently,M. tuberculosisacid resistance was linked to asparagine metabolism.65An asparagine transporter AnsP2 imports asparagine into the bacterium where asparaginase AnsA breaks down asparagine to aspartate with the production of ammonia. The ammonia buffers hydrogen ions by forming NH4+. AnsA is also secreted to perform this reaction in the environment around the mycobacterium. InM. marinum, AnsP2 is encoded byMMAR_0627and AnsA is encoded byMMAR_2360. Transcript levels of these genes did not alter during exposure to LSMMG and hence the ability to produce ammonia may not have changed in LSMMG-exposedM. marinum. This may explain why LSMMG-exposedM. marinumwere not more sensitive to killing by acid. Could LSMMG alter the virulence ofM. marinum? M. marinumstrain 1218R,53a strain isolated from infected fish, and a derivative of this strain, LHM4, were used for this study. LHM4 carries an integrated plasmid pDEAM2, which encodes red fluorescent protein and confers kanamycin resistance. Bacteria were grown in the dark at 30 °C in tubes in a rotating incubator (120 r.p.m.)27or in HARVs attached to a rotating cell culture system (RCCS, Synthecon, Houston, TX, USA) in Middlebrook 7H9 broth (Difco, Detroit, MI, USA) supplemented with ADS (5% BSA Fraction V, 2% Dextrose, 0.81% NaCl) to 10%, 0.5% glycerol, 100 μg cycloheximide/ml, and 0.2% Tween 80. Cultures were also grown on solid Middlebrook 7H10 agar (Difco) supplemented with 10% ADS, 0.5% glycerol, and 100 μg cycloheximide/ml. LHM4 cultures also contained 20 μg kanamycin/ml. To initiate cultures, solid medium was inoculated from a frozen stock and incubated for ~7 days to obtain colonies. Colonies were used to inoculate tube cultures (~3 ml). The tube cultures were grown for 5–7 days to an OD600~1. This tube culture was then diluted to OD6000.0005 or 0.002 before growth in 10 or 50 ml HARVs, respectively. The lower OD600of the culture at the start of growth in the 10 ml HARVs prevented the cultures from being at saturation density for the majority of the 4-day exposure time. For the short exposure time, the cultures were grown in 50 ml HARVs. For the long exposure, the cultures were grown in 10 ml HARVs for 4 days and then re-diluted to OD6000.002 in 50 ml HARVs for another ~35 h. For NG, HARVs were rotated (25 r.p.m.) on an axis parallel to the direction of gravitational force, while they were rotated (25 r.p.m.) on an axis perpendicular to the direction of the gravitational force for LSMMG.3 For the continuous growth studies, one large volume of OD6000.0005 culture was prepared from an initiating tube culture and split between two 10 ml HARVs: one was subjected to NG and the other to LSMMG. After 4 days the cultures were removed and the OD600was determined. The statistical difference between the LSMMG and NG cultures was tested by aT-test performed using SAS 9.4 (SAS Gary, NC, USA). To examine culture density during exponential growth, one large volume of OD6000.002 culture was prepared from an initiating tube culture and split between two 50 ml HARVs: one was subjected to NG and the other to LSMMG. Where specified, 3 μg catalase/ml (0.06 U/ml; ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was included. Bacteria were grown for ~150 h but the HARVs were stopped to remove samples (1–2 ml). Liquid medium was added to the HARV to replace the removed sample volume (2–4% of the volume) to maintain a low-shear environment. In order to obtain accurate OD600and CFU measurements, a disaggregation procedure was used: SDS (final concentration 0.01%) was added; the culture was passed through a 27.5 gauge needle and either vortexed before measurement of the OD600or preparation of dilutions, or the bacteria were allowed to settle for 5 min before growth on solid medium. Use of the syringe needle, vortexing, and then allowing the culture to settle before plating on solid medium is standard procedure for mycobacterium.32Colonies from each sample were grown on at least two plates of solid medium for 7–10 days. Colonies were counted for each time point and the CFU/ml calculated. Preliminary experiments confirmed by microscopy that disaggregation of cultures was achieved using the syringe needle, and initial experiments determined that the addition of the SDS to the NG and LSMMG cultures only during the disaggregation and dilution stage did not alter colony forming ability (data not shown). To determine statistical differences between LSMMG and NG cultures during the 37–70 h time period of growth, regression analysis was performed on the OD600data using SAS 9.4 (SAS). A portion of the LHM4 culture grown for 4 days in a 10 ml HARV was passed through a 27.5 gauge needle and fixed by the addition of 30 μl 4% paraformaldehyde to 10 μl of culture. Samples were placed at 4 °C for at least 24 h before the measurement of the diameter and length of 50 bacteria using microscopy. The Instat3 program and the UnpairedT-test or the Mann–Whitney test was used to compare the lengths and diameters of the bacterium. Seventy-five base-paired-end RNA-Seq reads were aligned to theM. marinumstrain M genome (Genbank accession numberCP000854) using the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) aligner. Reads were visualized using the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV, Broad Institute,http://www.broadinstitute.org/igv/home). Reads were aligned to theM. marinumstrain M transcriptome using RSEM version 1.2.9 for transcript quantification. The fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM) was calculated for each gene and sample gene level differential expression analysis was performed using EBseq version 1.1.5 within RSEM. For the short or long exposure times, the LSMMG samples were compared with NG samples. The LSMMG samples from the two exposure times (short and long) were also compared. Changes in expression were significant ifP<0.05. The functions of genes were assigned according to the Marinolist (http://mycobrowser.epfl.ch/marinolist.html). Pathway assignment used the Marinolist advanced search and the literature, andM. marinumorthologs ofM. tuberculosisgenes were identified usinghttp://tuberculist.epfl.ch. Transcript levels for the genes assigned to pathways were analyzed and heat maps generated using GeneSifter (http://www.geospiza.com/Products/AnalysisEdition.shtml). RNA-Seq data has been deposited in the GeneLab database. Reverse-transcriptase quantitative PCR LHM4 were removed from the HARV and the OD600measured in a sample after disaggregation. Bacteria were in exponential phase (OD6000.09–0.2). For radiation and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) studies, bacteria were centrifuged and washed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Tween 80 (Tw-PBS), before resuspension at OD600~0.2 in Tw-PBS. Two samples (200 μl in a sealed tube) were prepared for each time point or dose. One sample was treated (1–4 h) with 5 mmol/l H2O2at 30 °C or with gamma radiation (100–400 Gy) at room temperature. The second sample was not treated and was used as the control to determine the CFU/ml at zero treatment at the time point. A similar method was used to treat the bacteria with acid. The bacteria were centrifuged and resuspended at OD600~0.2 in growth medium (control) or growth medium at pH 3.5. A small amount of one mole per liter citric acid was added to the medium to reach pH 3.5. Once the bacteria were resuspended, the pH was checked using pH paper. The control and acid-treated samples were incubated at 30 °C for 1–4 h. After all treatment regimens, bacteria were disaggregated and diluted as described above and grown on three plates containing solid medium. Bacteria were incubated at 30 °C for 7–10 days and the CFU/ml calculated for each control and treated sample. Survival was calculated by: The survival data were compared by calculating the area under the curve for each data set using the Trapezoidal Rule, and the Student’sT-test was used to compare the values. These statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.4 (SAS). We thank Ms Paula Polk in the Genomic Core at LSUHSC for performing the preparation and sequencing of RNA-Seq samples.
