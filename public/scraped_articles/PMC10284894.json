  "content": "Microbial applications for sustainable space exploration beyond low Earth orbit Received 2022 Jul 11; Accepted 2023 May 25; Collection date 2023. With the construction of the International Space Station, humans have been continuously living and working in space for 22 years. Microbial studies in space and other extreme environments on Earth have shown the ability for bacteria and fungi to adapt and change compared to “normal” conditions. Some of these changes, like biofilm formation, can impact astronaut health and spacecraft integrity in a negative way, while others, such as a propensity for plastic degradation, can promote self-sufficiency and sustainability in space. With the next era of space exploration upon us, which will see crewed missions to the Moon and Mars in the next 10 years, incorporating microbiology research into planning, decision-making, and mission design will be paramount to ensuring success of these long-duration missions. These can include astronaut microbiome studies to protect against infections, immune system dysfunction and bone deterioration, or biological in situ resource utilization (bISRU) studies that incorporate microbes to act as radiation shields, create electricity and establish robust plant habitats for fresh food and recycling of waste. In this review, information will be presented on the beneficial use of microbes in bioregenerative life support systems, their applicability to bISRU, and their capability to be genetically engineered for biotechnological space applications. In addition, we discuss the negative effect microbes and microbial communities may have on long-duration space travel and provide mitigation strategies to reduce their impact. Utilizing the benefits of microbes, while understanding their limitations, will help us explore deeper into space and develop sustainable human habitats on the Moon, Mars and beyond. Subject terms:Microbiology, Biotechnology, Biological techniques The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has pledged to return humans to the Moon in the next two years and land the first humans on Mars by 2033. The journey beyond low Earth orbit (LEO) will expand human civilization, enable future space settlements, provide scientific knowledge of the evolution of our planet and the solar system, and create global partnerships in the quest for further space exploration1,2. Under the Artemis plan, a crewed lunar flyby is scheduled for 2024 (Artemis II), followed by a lunar landing in 2025 (Artemis III)—the first since the end of the Apollo era in 1972, and eventually a sustainable lunar presence by the end of this decade3. Critical to the success of the Artemis program will be Gateway, an orbiting platform where astronauts will live and conduct research, while providing support for lengthy expeditions on the lunar surface. The Artemis program will establish a base camp at the lunar south pole that will serve as a steppingstone for human missions to Mars. Research and development at the lunar base will act as prototypes for these future Mars missions, where NASA can establish best practices for long-term human exploration in these adverse extraterrestrial environments4. Unlike the operation of the International Space Station (ISS), which is regularly resupplied from Earth within hours after launch, deep space missions will require self-sufficiency and sustainability independent of Earth. This will involve utilization of renewable resources, recycling of waste, power generation, and a continuous supply of food, water, and oxygen over a prolonged/indefinite period. The moon is the shortest distance beyond LEO with a deep space environment offering unique research opportunities to be conducted under the Artemis program. The lunar orbiter Gateway will function similarly to the ISS utilizing a Power and Propulsion Element that will use solar energy to propel and power the spacecraft, a Habitation and Logistics Outpost that will serve as the living quarters and research workspace, and docking ports for spacecraft such as Orion, that will be the first of its kind to transport astronauts to and from deep space5,6. The ISS and Earth-orbiting satellites capitalize on solar energy as a renewable resource for power, however in more distant outposts such as Mars, other factors like distance from the sun, angle, and weather (i.e., dust storms) affect the efficiency of energy provided by the solar arrays7. Such was the case with NASA’s Insight mission, where a recent Martian dust storm led to accumulated dust on the solar panels preventing adequate sunlight from reaching them, forcing the lander into battery-conserving “safe mode”8. Similar dust coverage issues were experienced during Apollo missions due to electrically charged lunar dust adhering to solar panels on the lunar lander9,10. Resupply cargo, like those that are frequently sent to the ISS, is costly, and may not be feasible for long-duration space missions (it takes ~7 months to get to Mars). Thus, self-sustainability in food and oxygen production on extraterrestrial outposts, such as on the Moon and Mars, is crucial11. In addition, communication delays between Earth and Mars can range from 5 to 20 min depending on the position of the planets12. Lack of cargo resupply missions and communication delays can be detrimental to human health-related emergencies making it imperative for crew members to be self-sufficient in health risk prevention and treatment. Therefore, solutions to address limited resources and human health risks that can be feasibly implemented in deep space must be established prior to the Artemis and Mars exploration missions. This could be achieved through the exploitation and engineering of microbes important to human health13–16, agriculture17, food production18–20, the ecosystem21–25, and the built environment26,27. Figure1provides an overview of the various roles microbes could play in deep space exploration. Fig. 1. Summary of microbial impact during long-duration space missions. Space exploration can benefit from the use of microbes in a variety of applications including incorporation into biological life support systems (BLSS), in situ resource utilization beyond LEO, and astronaut therapeutics. However, increased pathogenicity and biofilm formation during spaceflight could threaten astronaut health and spacecraft integrity so mitigation strategies will be needed to prevent such hazards. Microbial applications related to health (purple), renewable resources (green) or both (purple and green) are highlighted. Figure created with BioRender.com. In this review, we will examine some key considerations for planning crewed space missions that allow for self-sufficiency and sustainability and specifically the role that microbes can play in achieving these goals. We will also discuss the possible detrimental effects of microbes that could derail a mission, such as biofouling and increased pathogenicity, and suggest mitigation strategies to help alleviate some of these concerns. Bioregenerative life support systems and the value of microbial inclusion NASA has been sending astronauts to space for the last 60 years, and with the advent of deep space missions to the Moon and Mars, astronauts must be self-sufficient to provide atmospheric conditions and necessities for human life (i.e., purified water and nutrient-rich food)28,29. This self-sufficiency can be achieved by implementing bioregenerative life support systems (BLSS). BLSS generate essential resources for human survival through biological processes, with four main purposes: higher plant cultivation, water treatment, solid waste bioconversion, and atmosphere revitalization. Microbes play a vital role in these biological processes by reducing the storage and resupply of materials necessary for a life-sustaining, regenerative environment. Research on BLSS dates back to as early as the 1960s, by researchers worldwide. Examples include NASA’s “BioHome,” a 650 sq ft closed system that utilized a wetland system for wastewater recycling, and a biological system including plants and microorganisms for reducing organic contamination from wastewater29; the Soviet space program’s Biosphere 3 (BIOS-3), an underground closed system of phytotrons, that consists of a crew area and an entirely enclosed greenhouse, growing wheat and vegetables as well as algae cultivators for air revitalization30; the European Space Agency’s (ESA) Micro-Ecological Life Support System Alternative (MELiSSA), which includes five compartments where plants and microorganisms purify the air, produce food, and recycle waste31; and Beighan University’s Lunar Permanent Astrobase Life-support Artificial Closed Ecosystem (Palace) 1, comprising three cabins that work simultaneously to manage atmospheric conditions, produce crops, breed insects, and recover solid and liquid waste32. In all these support systems, microbes are an essential component in the regulation, degradation and circulation of materials and energy, ultimately enhancing the effectiveness of these life support systems. One issue with hydroponic growth systems on Earth is microbial contamination, most often byFusarium oxysporum40. Certain abiotic conditions such as high humidity, high temperature, and reduced airflow can cause undesirably high levels of microbial growth41,42. Veggie is a hydroponic system that has also succumbed to these limitations.Zinnia hybrida, an annual flowering plant, grown in the Veggie system on the ISS, developed foliar, stem, and root rot disease, due to high water stress and low airflow43. Whole genome sequencing analysis of the diseased tissue44and subsequent virulence assays43, identified the culprit asF. oxysporum. This illustrates the potential difficulties of growing crops in hydroponic systems, on Earth or in space. An alternative to a hydroponic system is a soil-based one where Martian and lunar regolith can be used as an alternative to terrestrial soil. This in situ resource utilization (ISRU) of regolith would reduce the need for costly resupply missions of terrestrial soil. While many plants and crops have been successfully grown in simulated Martian and lunar regolith their characteristics do differ from what would be expected with terrestrial soil45–49. One limiting factor of regolith is the absence of reactive nitrogen, an essential nutrient for optimal plant growth and function50–54. However, the introduction of nitrogen-fixing and nitrogen-cycling bacterial species into regolith to bind nitrogen from the atmosphere and transform it into reactive nitrogen (in the form of NO3− and NH4+) could be used as a method to improve regolith soil fertility55. Increased Martian soil fertility through symbiotic relationships has been examined with clover (Melilotus officinalis), grown in simulated regolith that had been inoculated with the nitrogen-fixing bacterium,Sinorhizobium meliloti56. This study found that after three months, inoculated treatments produced greater clover biomass compared to uninoculated treatments, 0.29 g and 0.01 g, respectively. However, whenS. melilotiinoculated clover was grown in common terrestrial potting mix the total clover biomass was seven-fold greater than when grown in simulated regolith56. While plant-bacterial symbiosis could improve soil fertility and plant growth in Martian regolith, additional experiments are required to achieve terrestrial levels of plant biomass. Other plant stressors, such as limited nutrients, may prevent plants from reaching optimal biomass56. Essential nutrients, such as potassium, calcium, magnesium, iron, manganese, nickel, and zinc, are present in extraterrestrial soils but not at sufficient levels for plant uptake. Zaets et al. showed that bacteria can increase the bioavailability of these minerals in simulated regolith using inoculants ofPseudomonas sp. IMBG163,Pseudomonas aureofaciensIMBG164,Stenotrophomonas maltophiliaIMBG147,Paenibacillus sp. IMBG156,Klebsiella oxytocaIMBG26, andPantoea agglomeransIMV45. When inoculated with these bacteria, increased bioavailability of essential nutrients in the soil and plant tissue ofTagetes patula(i.e., French marigold) led to increased plant growth, seed germination and survival45. Conversely, only 20–30% of plants grown in non-inoculated soils achieved seed germination45. In addition to increasing nutrient bioavailability, these bacteria were also able to reduce toxic levels of zinc, chromium, nickel, iron, calcium, and sodium, by up to 50%, within plant tissue45. By increasing nutrient availability and reducing toxic accumulation of ions within the soil, microorganisms can be used as a tool for conditioning Martian and lunar basalt for effective plant growth and plant nutrient uptake. Water is another crucial plant resource limited on both the Moon and Mars. Previous discoveries have found evidence of liquid water flows on Mars, coming from giant ice slabs beneath the surface57, though extracting and recycling water from these ice slabs is energetically impractical. In addition, Martian soil has limited water-holding capacity due to low organic carbon content, however, this can be improved by using bacteria that produce polysaccharides or adhesive proteins that bind soil particles, thereby increasing the moisture content of soil58. This microbe-soil interaction can be exploited on Martian outposts to reduce the need for copious amounts of water, increase soil stability, and prevent soil desiccation. Several studies on agricultural soils show that the application of microalgae and cyanobacteria to the soil can improve soil fertility and health59–61. Nascimento et al. assessed the ability of the N-fixing cyanobacteriaNostoc sp. to act as an organic fertilizer and soil conditioner under normal and drought conditions60. Researchers appliedNostoc sp. and urea as liquid fertilizers to soil growing wheat (Triticum aestivum), corn (Zea mays), and common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris). Drought conditions were simulated by watering the plant to water holding capacity and drying the soil for 14–16 days. Under drought conditions, plants fertilized withNostoc sp. reached a biomass 150% greater than plants continuously watered to water holding capacity; while plants fertilized only with urea attained only 70% of the biomass compared to those continuously held at water holding capacity. Researchers also found that untreated soils exhibited more leaf wilting from water stress compared to those plants grown in soil treated withNostoc sp60. This research shows the promise that cyanobacteria can have for improving soil quality for plant growth beyond LEO. Just as microorganisms are a vital part of terrestrial plant production systems, microorganisms will play an important role in higher plant production and soil systems on future deep space missions and extraterrestrial outposts. Previous research indicates that plant production using hydroponic systems is a promising method for plant production in microgravity34–36, but further optimization will be required to prevent fungal contamination in these systems43. Using soil-based plant growth systems is a promising alternative to circumvent the limitations of hydroponics, but research is limited in this area within BLSS. Therefore, further research using soil-based plant growth systems, supplemented with microorganisms, may improve the effectiveness of BLSS and self-sufficiency of astronauts on deep space missions. Microbes also play a crucial role in solid waste processing (including bodily waste), inedible plant material, and other solid decomposable substances within bioregenerative systems. Drying is the first step to recycling solid waste30,32,77. This step allows the extraction of water from solid waste, the retention of organic matter, and the removal of inorganic material78. Dried, solid waste is then fermented in a solid waste bioreactor containing microbes that degrade plant waste32,79,80. This method has shown solid waste degradation rates between 41% and 87.7%79. The degraded solid waste can either be taken out of the system or applied to a plant system, providing a carbon and nitrogen-rich source of residue fertilizer or soil-like substance that increases soil fertility and overall plant health and productivity81–83. Another system proposed by Tang et al. utilizes a two-system recycling unit for either domestic water or wastewater79. Domestic water is purified by first running it through a two-stage membrane bioreactor and then passing it through a nanofiltration system, to produce hygiene water. The second system utilizes anaerobic, mostly Bacteroidetes, and aerobic, mostly Proteobacteria, microbial bioreactors to recover organic matter and N from wastewater79. Within this system, microorganisms are also utilized to degrade solid waste as part of the microbial fermentation facility or Bio-toilet. The facility includes a source separation module that separates urine from feces, a primary bioreactor where feces are combined with other inedible plant material to be degraded by microorganisms, and a secondary bioreactor for further degradation by microbes. This system was tested during 108-day experiment housing four crew members at the China Astronaut Research and Training Center. Researchers achieved 100% water regeneration with 87.7% recycled solid waste79,80. It is projected that crew members on a lunar mission will inhale about 1 kg of O2per day and exhale approximately 1.3 kg of CO291. Production of O2and removal of CO2during space missions could be achieved through photosynthesis, the process by which plants, algae and cyanobacteria convert CO2, sunlight, and water, into O2and energy92. Cyanobacteria are the earliest oxygenic photosynthetic organisms on Earth and have been contributing to Earth’s atmospheric oxygen for the last 2.5 billion years93,94. One advantage of using cyanobacteria over plants for air revitalization is their ability to perform photosynthesis with far less sunlight than is required for plant growth. Under normal conditions, plants and cyanobacteria use chlorophyll-ato convert visible (i.e. “white”) light into energy, but some cyanobacteria can perform far-red photosynthesis, using chlorophyll-f, a spectrally red-shifted variant of chlorophyll-awhich absorbs longer wavelengths of light95–97. This allows those cyanobacteria to also perform photosynthesis and harvest energy when grown in low- or filtered- light environments95–97. This photosynthetic efficiency, coupled with the ability to survive the harsh conditions of space98–101make cyanobacteria ideal components in BLSS destined for the Moon and Mars. Photobioreactors can be incorporated into BLSS to increase the production of oxygen by cyanobacteria or algae for enhanced air revitalization. ESA’s MELiSSA project is a BLSS concept focused on the regeneration of atmospheric gases and water, waste treatment, and food production for crewed space missions102,103. The system comprises the listed compartments, each with a specific organism contributing to the recycling pathway104. One of the five compartments includes a gas-lift photobioreactor containing photosynthetic cyanobacteria, specificallySpirulina platensis, that uses the CO2produced by its predecessor compartment to produce oxygen84.S. platensiswas chosen for its light energy conversion efficiency, its ability to tolerate fluctuations in pH, and its high nutritional value (containing 55–70% protein, 15–25% carbohydrates, 18% essential fatty acids in addition to vitamins, minerals, and pigments105). Another species of cyanobacteria that is being considered for air revitalization, nitrate removal and edible biomass production in MELiSSA isLimnospira indica. In a recent 35-day ground study,L. indicawas grown in a simplified closed-loop version of MELiSSA and the effect of urea, ammonium (the prominent nitrogen forms present in non-nitrified urine) and nitrate, on the oxygen production capacity ofL. indica, was measured106. It was observed that cyanobacteria fed nitrate or urea could effectively reach the desired (set point) O2level of 20.3% and maintain ambient O2levels, while those fed ammonium could only reach a maximum O2level of 19.5%106. This study provided preliminary evidence for the use of ammonium-rich and urea-rich media (such as urine), forL. indicacultivation and air revitalization.L. indicahas also been grown in photobioreactors on the ISS, as part of the Arthrospira-B spaceflight experiment, and no inhibitory effect on oxygen production and growth was observed, as compared to ground controls107. These studies show the promise of cyanobacteria-based BLSS and/or photobioreactors destined for the Moon and Mars to provide clean air for crew in spacecraft or in lunar/Mars habitats. Additional research is needed for optimization such as identifying additional candidate species, growing combinations of different cyanobacteria for synergistic effects, and testing more growth conditions to achieve enhanced biomass and increased efficiency. Biological in situ resource utilization for sustainability In addition to BLSS which can increase self-sufficiency and sustainability beyond LEO, the ability to utilize in situ resources, will also play a role in long-term human habitats on the Moon and Mars. For instance, electricity and power can be generated with microbial fuel cells (MFC) coupled with in situ organic material, and biomining can be used to extract resources for construction, repair, and maintenance of structural components and equipment. MFC are small, lightweight devices that convert organic matter from renewable sources into electricity using microorganisms as catalysts109(Fig.2). Microorganisms involved in this electrochemical activity are called exoelectrogens because of their ability to transfer electrons exogenously to electron acceptors109. Some examples of exoelectrogens includePseudomonas110,Shewanella111,Geobacter112, andDesulfuromonas113. MFC consists of two chambers, separated by a proton exchange membrane. In the anode chamber, exoelectrogens, shown as a biofilm in this figure, anaerobically oxidize organic matter releasing protons and electrons. A closer look at this interaction can be seen in the bottom image. The electrons released during the oxidation of organic matter transfer to the anode and travel to the cathode in the second chamber via an external circuit, creating an electrical current. The protons released travel through the proton exchange membrane into the cathode chamber, where the protons and electrons react with oxygen and form water. The idea behind MFC has been around for over a century, but it is just within the past few decades that it has become a commercialized product. MFC can produce an energy output up to 5.61 W/m2114–116,and can also be used for wastewater recycling, toxin removal, bioremediation, and resource recovery117–121. These same concepts can be utilized on future Martian or lunar extraterrestrial outposts for energy production and within BLSS. In 2007, de Vet and Rutgers were the first to test the capabilities of MFC energy production under simulated and real microgravity conditions aboard the ISS usingRhodoferax ferrireducensto produce electricity. Energy output averaged 0.1 mA in 1 G, 0.35 mA in simulated microgravity, and 0.02 mA on the ISS. While the differences were not statistically significant, the study did show the potential for MFC to operate in space122. This mechanism for energy production is not yet practical for space travel due to the low energy output, considering a standard 40 W light bulb draws 0.36 A to operate, but can be initially utilized for its byproducts, such as clean wastewater123. Waste recycling as an energy source Waste can accumulate during space travel in the form of urine, fecal matter, and inedible food and with the help of microbes, this waste can be repurposed for energy production as well as for nutrient recovery and production of potable water. Urine is an excellent feedstock for MFC as it contains high levels of urea, organic ammonium salts, and other organic compounds that microbes can convert into electricity86thus making urine MFC effective mechanisms for energy production124–127. Some urine MFC can not only produce energy but recover nutrients as well. Lu et al. designed a three-chamber MFC to remove organic pollutants, recover N, phosphorus (P), and sulfur (S), and produce energy from urine125. The maximum power output was 1300 mW/m2, with almost complete removal of pollutants, including over 97% of urea, total nitrogen, sulfate, phosphate, and chemical oxygen demand, as well as 40% of ammonium, 15% of salts, and 91-99% of organic compounds. The MFC also recovered essential nutrients, including 42% of total N, 37% of phosphate, 59% of sulfate and 33% of total salts125. This recovery technology can be especially valuable within other compartments of BLSS, including plant compartments, by providing nutrient-rich water free of contaminants. In order for urine MFC to also be used as a mechanism to convert urine to potable water, the high level of inorganic salts present in urine (~14.2 g/L)86need to first be removed for MFC to function efficiently125. This can be achieved with an alternative type of MFC, called a microbial desalination cell, which follows the same concept as a standard MFC but with an added desalination chamber between the anode and cathode128. Cao et al. tested this mechanism of water desalination at concentrations comparable to the salinity of urine at 5, 20, and 35 g/L using a mixed bacterial culture, with the salt concentration determined by a change in conductivity of the solution128. This microbial desalination cell produced a maximum power output of 2 W/m2, with ~88–94% of salt removed, depending on the initial concentration128. Inedible food waste will be an inevitable part of spaceflight and extraterrestrial outposts on the Moon and Mars that need to be disposed of, as on Earth. This organic material can act as substrates in MFC for energy production, Colombo et al. tested the energy producing capabilities of MFC with various food-industry organic wastes as inputs, including those rich in fibers, sugars, proteins, and acid130. A one-chamber MFC was fed each type of organic substrate, and the concentration of organic compounds was measured periodically to obtain the rate of degradation. The maximum power output for each organic waste substrate was 50 mV for sugar, 40 mV for fiber, 30 mV for protein, and 10 mV for acid, with each organic compound degraded by 90%130. While MFC will be a useful tool to create energy and recycle organic waste beyond LEO, research and development is still ongoing to develop more efficient systems with a larger and sustained power output. Some of these ideas involve the use of different materials (such as ceramics) and configurations (large vs small, stacked vs dispersed)131. Gajda et al. tested a small (70 mm long, 15 mm diameter, 2 mm thickness) and a large (100 mm long, 42 mm diameter, 3 mm thickness) terracotta MFC. They found that the smaller terracotta MFC achieved a power density output 2.9-fold greater than the large MFC, at 20.4 W/m3and 7.0 W/m3, respectively. Gajda et al. also tested the performance of stacking MFC for a small-scale multi-unit system that could be utilized on future crewed outposts132. They compared power output of a small module containing 28 MFC units and a larger module containing 560 MFC units. Stacked 560 units created a five-fold improvement in power output of 245 mW compared to the 28 MFC unit. Another concept is the PeePower urinals which collect urine and feces directly from the source, producing energy through multiple ceramic MFC133. This leads to concentrated wastewater inputted into the MFC rather than diluted samples, which reduces power output. Researchers tested a 288-unit MFC on a university campus which averaged 5–10 users per day. The PeePower urinals were able to produce an average of 75 mW which powered the LED lights directly connected to the MFC stack for 75 h. Another 432-unit MFC was tested during a large music festival which averaged 1000 users per day. In this setting, the PeePower urinals were able to produce an average of 300 mW which successfully powered lighting within the urinals over a seven-day period133. While the success of PeePower was demonstrated on Earth, it will be important to test similar models of power generation using urine and feces in microgravity. None the less, this research provides the foundation for the development of similar toilet-like MFC to be used for power generation on deep space missions. Photosynthetic microorganisms, such as algae or cyanobacteria, can be utilized to convert light energy into electrical energy, termed microbial electrochemical technology72. Biophotovoltaics is a specific type of electrochemical technology in which phototrophic microorganisms produce electricity by utilizing incoming light energy to split water molecules, generating electrons and protons that can be used to produce an electrical current within an MFC. Several cyanobacteria species have been tested for use in biophotovoltaics, such asSynechocystis138,139, Nostoc140,141, Lyngbya142,143, andLeptolyngbia144,145. Kaushik et al. tested the energy producing capabilities ofSynechococcususing a two-chamber photosynthetic MFC built with light transparent glass146. The MFC operated through a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle under a white light intensity of 15 W/m2. Maximum power density output of the photosynthetic MFC was 0.61 W/m2146. This technology provides a feasible method of energy production on extraterrestrial outposts, but further research needs to be completed to increase power output and optimize light conversion. Research on the use of in situ resources such as wastewater, plant systems, and solar radiation, shows potential for the use of MFC as a mode of power generation and sustainability on extraterrestrial outposts. Though power generation is limited from these substrates at the moment future work may enhance their efficiency. In addition, other sources of power, such as nuclear power, could supplement these MFC systems to provide adequate power generation in habitats and spacecraft beyond LEO147. The biomining process is not limited to Earth. It may serve as an innovative method for reducing the cost of raw materials and energy requirements beyond LEO, enhancing the sustainability of life on extraterrestrial outposts. Martian and lunar basalt are known to contain many valuable metals, such as iron, nickel, copper, vanadium, and many others, that are suitable substrates that can be biomined by microbes156,157. Biomining of these metals from Martian and lunar surfaces could provide the necessary materials for the in-situ construction of buildings, electrical systems, spacecraft equipment, solar cells, and heating and lighting systems in human habitats beyond LEO158. With the abundance of iron in Mars regolith (17.9% wt), iron may be a crucial resource produced through biomining162. Iron is one of the most-processed metals on Earth that is incorporated in most building materials and would be heavily relied on for construction, repair, and maintenance of buildings at extraterrestrial outposts. Copper is another important metal that can be produced through biomining, with nearly 20–30% of all copper produced on Earth extracted through biomining162. For over 30 years, copper has been an essential metal used in the construction of rocket engines163,164and being able to extract copper and other minerals from in situ resources on extraterrestrial outposts will allow engine maintenance and repair to occur beyond LEO, reducing the cost and time of sending replacement parts from Earth. Bioreactors are necessary for biomining reactions to occur. Terrestrial biomining processes most often occur in open, non-sterile tank reactors that require constant stirring to distribute oxygen and nutrients171. To implement biomining on extraterrestrial outposts, it is essential to assess the extent to which differing gravity levels impact microbe-mineral interactions within these stirred-tank bioreactors. An experiment called BioRock, aimed to do this by creating a prototype biomining reactor for space experimentation on the ISS159. The biomining reactor has three main components: the culture chamber, the medium reservoir chamber, and a fixative reservoir chamber, where a fixative is injected to halt microbial growth after the biomining reactions take place (Fig.3). Two biomining reactors are placed together within two levels of containment. Pre-test flights found the bioreactors to be successful at growing the model microorganisms,S. desiccabilis, B. subtilis, andC. metallidurans. These microorganisms were chosen as they are low-risk pathogens with the ability to survive desiccation for space flight, limited requirements for growth, and are present in mineral-rich environments. Growth was determined based on optical density in nutrient solution after three weeks. ForS. desiccabilis, growth occurred in all tested geometries of biomining reactors, ranging from 0.308 to 0.804 OD159. BioRock has also been successfully used to test REE and vanadium biomining capabilities ofS. desiccabilis, B. subtilis, andC. metalliduransin microgravity, Mars gravity and Earth’s gravity160,161. Fig. 3. Schematic depiction of a biomining reactor. The biomining reactor has three main components: the culture chamber, the media reservoir chamber, and a fixative reservoir chamber (shown in section 1). The culture chamber is where the biomining reactions take place and where the microorganisms reside before the media is injected. The media reservoir chamber contains the nutrients required for the biomining reaction to occur and is injected into the culture chamber to begin the biomining reaction (section 2). Once the biomining reaction is completed, a fixative is injected to halt microbial growth (section 3). An additional method of biomining, proposed by Volger et al., utilizes a two-bioreactor system and aims to further enhance ISRU on Martian outposts compared to traditional bioreactors172. The first system is an algae bioreactor, which utilizesChlorella vulgaristo produce biomass for the biomining reactor and oxygen. The algal biomass is then utilized byShewanella oneidensisas a growth medium in the biomining reactor. In the biomining reactor,S. oneidensismines iron ores from Martian regolith; the biomass-rich material left over after extraction can then be used for plant growth. Based on modeled algae growth and biomining performance, the system is projected to produce 0.031 kg O2per day and 100 kg of iron per Mars year172. This model needs to be further tested and future experiments should include exposure to various gravity conditions to assess the impact that this spaceflight stressor will have on growth and performance. The BioRock experiment and other biomining endeavors using iron-oxidizing and alternative candidate bacteria demonstrate potential for biomining in differing gravity levels and the potential for biomining as a source of ISRU at future Martian and lunar outposts. Biomining for elements known to be located within Martian and lunar regolith, such as iron and REE, will be essential for proper maintenance and production of devices and technology that promote sustainability and provide a foundation by which to launch operations for deep space exploration. Bioengineered microbes for space Microorganisms are an important, renewable resource that can be leveraged to produce pharmaceuticals or therapeutics, biological life support systems, and manufacturing materials for human space exploration and colonization that could help reduce the need for costly resupply missions beyond LEO173. Candidate microbes can be chosen for these applications based on the availability of genetic tools for manipulation, desired metabolic properties, and tolerance to environmental conditions. These microbes can be further engineered to make them more well-suited for biotechnological applications for interplanetary travel or extraterrestrial settlements using synthetic biology tools. Synthetic biology involves the rational design or repurposing of living organisms and biological systems. Using synthetic biology, microorganisms can be engineered or built de novo with characterized parts and tools to endow them with new or improved functions173. The risk that long-duration space missions pose for crewmembers is not yet completely understood but the extreme conditions, such as microgravity, radiation, and confinement, coupled with microbiome dysregulation may lead to or enhance the disruption of bodily functions174. Researchers have studied the effect of simulated or actual spaceflight conditions on gastrointestinal (GI) problems175, the development of diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular disorders176, or a predisposition to contracting infections177–179. The use of probiotics as a countermeasure to combat changes in the microbiome as a result of spaceflight is being investigated to support astronaut health on long-duration space missions180,181. Probiotics are living organisms able to survive in the gastric environment that provide health benefits and maintain or improve microbiome balance when consumed. On Earth, probiotics have been used to treat many ailments including weight and muscle loss, inflammation, dermatitis, immune disorders, mental health, and GI conditions (i.e., diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD))180,182. Engineered probiotics to combat infection Antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) may arise in space as a side effect of administering antibiotics to treat infections. Several studies have investigated the use ofDebaryomyces hanseniias a treatment for AAD in a mouse model.D. hanseniiis commonly used in the food industry for the processing of cheese and has been identified as part of the human gut microbiome193,194. When administered for treatment of AAD,D. hanseniialters the composition of the microbiome by promoting the growth of beneficial lactase-producing bacteria and by inhibiting the growth of opportunistic pathogens195–197. In one study, the presence of Proteobacteria in the intestinal mucosa increased in response to diarrhea, from ~19% in a normal group to ~36% in an AAD model group, and treatment withD. hanseniiwas able to restore Proteobacteria to normal levels195. Proteobacteria abundance often positively correlates with IBD and inflammation and is generally regarded as an indicator of microbiome instability198. In spaceflight, the proportion of Proteobacteria in the astronaut skin microbiome was decreased, namely Gammaproteobacteria and Betaproteobacteria175, while it was increased in the salivary microbiome199. While bacterial infections are typically treated with antimicrobials, the formation of biofilms and propagation of multi-drug resistance in the spaceflight environment (discussed later in this review) limits these therapeutic options. A promising alternative currently being investigated on Earth is the use of engineered microorganisms as live biotherapeutics (e.g., biosensors, probiotics with enhanced benefits, and drug delivery systems)200–204. Well-established microbial chassis organisms includeE. coliandSaccharomyces cerevisiae, though a microbe more well-suited to the target therapeutic environment or application can also be chosen. One example using a less conventional chassis was recently performed by Garrido et al. where they engineeredMycoplasma pneumoniae, a human lung pathogen, as a live biotherapeutic to treatS. aureusand other biofilm-associated infections in vivo205. Researchers created an attenuated strain ofM. pneumoniaeable to secrete anti-biofilm and bactericidal enzymes, dispersin B and lysostaphin, and demonstrated its ability to eliminate anS. aureusbiofilm in a mouse model205. Another candidate chassis that could be employed to eradicate pathogens isD. hansenii, which produces volatile organic compounds and mycocins that have demonstrated antimicrobial effects on several pathogenic bacteria and fungi. An alternative to secreting bactericidal proteins to kill pathogens is the incorporation of CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing technology into synthetic designs to create engineered probiotics for targeted bacterial killing. This was demonstrated by Neil et al. by delivering CRISPR/Cas9 on a conjugative plasmid which led to 99.9% eradication of antibiotic resistantE. coliand complete eradication ofCitrobacter rodentiumin the GI tract of a mouse model206. CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing has also been demonstrated inD. hansenii207, and could be applied to engineer this strain for increased production of mycocins that can targetC. albicans208,209. Microbes can also be engineered as biosensors to identify or inhibit pathogenic bacteria by sensing an important indicator molecule and releasing a signal or enzyme in response. For instance, biological targeting systems have been demonstrated using engineeredE. colifor directed killing of the biofilm-associated pathogenPseudomonas aeruginosa, a bacterium that has been demonstrated to have increased biofilm formation and pathogenicity on the ISS210. Saeidi et al. engineeredE. coliwith a synthetic genetic circuit containing three modules: sensing, lysing, and killing. The sensing module includes a constitutively expressed transcription factor,lasR, which detects and binds toN-Acyl homoserine lactone (AHL), a quorum sensing molecule released fromP. aeruginosa. This bound complex activates the lysing and killing modules expressing lysis E7 and pyocin S5 proteins, respectively. This leads to perforation of theE. colicell membrane and release of the bacteriocin which targets the pathogen and killed 99% of viable cells211. Following this study, Hwang et al. programmedE. coliwith a modular circuit containing the same sensing module coupled to a motility and killing module. The motility module expressed the chemotaxis protein CheZ to initiate motility toward the pathogen, while the killing module produced antimicrobial and biofilm-degrading proteins, MccS and DNaseI. Viability ofP. aeruginosawas examined and found thatE. coliharboring both the motility and killing biosensor modules resulted in the killing of 60% of cells210. Biological sensors to detect and/or reduce pathogenic bacteria using traditional chassis such as engineeredLactobacillusorE. colihave also been demonstrated against intestinalP. aeruginosa212, vancomycin-resistantEnterococcus213, Candida albicans214, andS. aureus215,216. These studies highlight the vast potential of engineered microbes to sense and kill space microbiome-associated pathogens and disrupt biofilms. Since the choice of probiotics is both bacteria- and ailment-dependent217, the use of synthetic biology to create genetically engineered biotherapeutics with higher complexity and multiple functions (i.e., able to target multiple pathogens) is vital to minimize the amount of cargo on future space missions. The viability of these therapeutics for humans and their ability to function in the conditions of spaceflight still need to be investigated, but these examples help to shed light on what the next generation of engineered biotherapeutics could offer. Engineered probiotics for disease prevention and detection Engineered probiotics can also be a valuable tool for the prevention or detection of more serious health issues such as GI disorders, kidney stones, cancer, and cardiovascular disease (CVD), or the treatment of their associated symptoms. Space-induced changes in the gut microbiome observed in astronauts aboard the ISS by Voorhies et al. included an increase inParasutterella, a bacteria associated with IBD175. In IBD pathology, purinergic receptors are activated by extracellular adenosine triphosphate (eATP) released by commensal gut bacteria and immune cells, promoting intestinal inflammation. Engineered yeast probiotics containing a human P2Y2 purinergic receptor have been developed for the treatment of IBD by responding to physiological eATP levels and secreting the eATP-degrading enzyme apyrase218. This probiotic was shown to be effective in a mouse model of IBD, decreasing intestinal inflammation and dysbiosis. Bacterial probiotics can also be engineered to detect gut inflammation by sensing tetrathionate, thiosulfate or nitric oxide219,220, or with programmable memory systems to detect and respond to an environmental stimulus221. The risk of kidney stones due to bone decalcification, dehydration, or increased growth rate of calcium-depositing nanobacteria222–224is increased in spaceflight, which could also be prevented or treated using probiotics. Calcium oxalate is the major component of kidney stones, therefore ideal probiotic bacteria are efficient in oxalate degradation, such asOxalobacter formigenes225andB. subtilis.B. subtilisstrain 168 has been presented as a novel probiotic therapy as it has been shown to break down the oxalate in kidney stones in aDrosophilamodel226. The oxalate decarboxylase (OxDC) enzyme derived fromB. subtiliscan also be used to engineer other bacteria as probiotics for the treatment of kidney stones. The expression and subsequent purification of this enzyme inE. coliwas able to reduce oxalate concentrations in a mouse model in urine and feces by 44% and 72%, respectively, compared to controls227. The OxDC gene was also introduced intoLactobacillus plantarumon a plasmid, leading to expression and secretion of this enzyme where it was able to degrade 70–77% of oxalate in vitro, and reduced oxalate as well as calcium, uric acid, creatinine, serum uric acid, and BUN/creatinine ratio in urine compared to controls in a rat model228. Probiotics includingLactobacillusandBifidobacteriumcan also be used to improve cardiovascular health by reducing weight, cholesterol, and adipose tissue while also preventing or attenuating injuries to the heart (e.g., heart failure, ischemia, cardiac hypertrophy)229. Using a rat model,Lactobacillus rhamnosusor a placebo was administered to subjects following coronary artery occlusion for a six-week duration. Compared to placebo controls, rats given the probiotic treatment showed attenuation of left ventricular hypertrophy, improved systolic and diastolic left ventricular function, and additional improvements up to six weeks after withdrawing treatment230. OtherLactobacillusspecies have had positive effects on CVD includingL. plantarumwhich helped to reduce serum levels of leptin and fibrinogen, which are CVD risk factors231. These probiotics can also be genetically engineered to enhance their potential benefits. For instance,E. coliNissle 1917 has been genetically engineered to produce N-acylphosphatidylethanolamines which, when administered to mice, led to decreased adiposity, insulin resistance and lipid accumulation in the liver232. This has important implications for astronauts as spaceflight can induce negative, aging-like effects on the cardiovascular system (i.e., decreased fitness, arterial stiffening, and insulin resistance) and radiation exposure has been well-characterized to increase the risk of developing radiation-induced cardiovascular disease (RICVD)233,234. Bacteria hold great potential for the development of easily modifiable biotherapeutics that could be invaluable for treatment or prevention of health issues during long-duration space missions. However, additional research and clinical validation is necessary before employing engineered bacteria as biotherapeutics for space-associated disorders and diseases. BLSS can provide crew members with oxygen, food, and water, and will be imperative for long-duration space missions and for the establishment of sustainable human habitats on the Moon or Mars. Due to their diverse applications for spaceflight, microalgae and cyanobacteria are often studied for their incorporation in BLSS and photobioreactors. They produce oxygen, remove carbon dioxide from the environment and help with water purification104,105,252,253. These microbes are also edible allowing their biomass to provide nutritional and therapeutic benefits without the need for protein purification35,254. Oxygen for astronauts on the ISS is currently transported in pressurized tanks from Earth or is produced using water onboard through electrolysis255. Therefore, the ability to improve carbon uptake and oxygen output using microbes on the ISS, for space travel and in future extraterrestrial habitats, is an essential step toward the creation of sustainable and self-sufficient systems. Oxygen production, CO2capture, and photosynthetic capacity could be enhanced in BLSS using synthetic biology tools to address the bottleneck of photosynthesis: the carbon fixation cycle. Metabolic engineering of cyanobacteria can improve photosynthetic capacity as demonstrated by Berepiki et al. where expression of mammalian cytochrome P450 (CYP1A1) acting as an electron sink inSynechococcusPCC 7002 improved photosynthetic efficiency and increased electron flow rate by ~30%256. Using the same cytochrome P450 gene, Santos-Marino et al. engineered metabolic pathways for sucrose production and cytochrome P450 as a carbon and electron sink, respectively, intoSynechococcus elongatus. Ultimately, this resulted in increased photosynthesis, and simultaneous expression of both sinks had an additive effect on photosystem I oxidation and photosystem II efficiency257. Another strategy to improve this cycle is by increasing the substrate concentration of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (RuBisCo) to improve carbon uptake. In the cyanobacteriumSynechocystissp. PCC6803, one study found that genetic installation of additional bicarbonate transporters resulted in a 2-fold increase in carbon uptake and biomass258. Metabolic engineering of cyanobacteria can also be used to produce industrially relevant high-value chemicals and bioproducts such as biofuels. Some engineering efforts have been demonstrated in the model cyanobacteria species,S. elongatusPCC7942 andSynechocystissp. PCC6803, to produce ethanol, ethylene, isobutyraldehyde, and isoprene259–262. The biotechnologically relevant bacteria,Ralstonia eutropha(i.e.,C. necator) has also been engineered by Dogutan and Nocera to capture CO2to produce biofuels and edible biomass, in an artificial photosynthetic cycle that is much more efficient than those that are naturally occurring263. Microbial production of nutrients In-space manufacturing and development can be challenging as necessary materials and supplies are not readily available and currently need to be transported or resupplied from Earth. Microbes offer a solution as they can be reprogrammed for the production of biologically derived materials (i.e., bioplastics, nanomaterials)280to generate useful components such as plastics, adhesives, composites, and rubbers for structural space applications. One material that would be beneficial to produce in situ beyond LEO is aerogels. Aerogels, first created by Kistler in 1931, are human-made, low-density solid materials with an interconnected porous network composed of 99.8% air, with the most common type being silica-based281. Photosynthetic organisms that can produce silica, primarily algae diatoms (e.g., Phaeodactylum tricornutum), are of interest for the generation of silica-based aerogels and have recently been incorporated into cellulose aerogel composites282,283. Aerogels are useful materials for space applications due to their low thermal conductivity, light weight, and high porosity284–286. To improve the habitability of other planets for humans and photosynthetic organisms, silica aerogels provide the benefit of allowing for the transmission of visible light for photosynthesis while simultaneously blocking hazardous UV radiation284. In addition, since aerogels are a thermally insulating material, they can raise surface temperatures through the solid-state greenhouse effect284. NASA is currently taking advantage of the thermal insulating properties of aerogels to protect spacecraft and rovers from the cold Martian surface temperature, such as for the Mars Pathfinder lander, Mars exploration rovers (Spirit and Opportunity) and Mars Science Laboratory mission (Curiosity rover)286. Aerogels have also been used as a method for capturing particles from space without damaging them, as demonstrated in the Stardust Mission286. Therefore, using a synthetic biology approach to generate aerogels from silica-producing organisms could be interesting to investigate further. Polymer production and degradation Plastic materials continue to play a vital role in the manufacturing of spacesuits and spacecraft. Progress has been made towards the sustainable production of high-strength, biodegradable plastics in engineered microorganisms. Specifically, efforts have been made to increase the production of polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) or polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) in engineered cyanobacteria,Synechococcus294andSynechocystissp. PCC6803295,296.Synechocystissp. PCC6803 has been engineered with the PHA biosynthetic pathway ofR. eutropha(i.e., Cupriavidus necator)296or the overexpression ofsigE295to increase PHA and PHB production, respectively. Metabolic engineering of the shikimate pathway inB. subtilisorS. cerevisiaefor the increased production ofpara-aminobenzoic acid (pABA) has also been studied, which can act as a precursor for high-strength polymers (e.g., aramid fibers)297,298. Ultimately, these biologically derived materials can be used to manufacture parts or even 3D-print hardware in space299. To make in-space manufacturing and construction off-planet more sustainable, ISRU or recycling of existing material components to produce feedstock for new materials is necessary300. Microorganisms offer a solution to this problem as many can naturally degrade polymers for metabolic products. Black fungi, which are a diverse group of extremophilic melanized fungi, have been investigated for this application due to their demonstrated ability to hydrolyze synthetic polymers301). For instance,Aureobasidium pullulans, a black fungus, has demonstrated microbial deterioration of plasticized polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and dioctyl adipate plasticizers302.Knufia chersonesos, another black fungus, has been shown to completely break down the synthetic copolymer polybutylene adipate terephthalate (PBAT)303. Secretome screening identified seven polyesterase enzymes that could potentially be involved in this observed polymer degradation, which lays the foundation for the possibility of further engineering of this biosynthetic pathway for more efficient degradation303. Therefore, this group of extremophilic organisms are promising candidates for plastic degradation, however, this process still needs to be investigated in simulated or spaceflight microgravity. Microgravity studies ofK. cheronesosthat analyzed the effects of simulated microgravity on the proteome and secretome found that scytalone dehydratase gene expression was upregulated in the wild-type strain and downregulated in a melanin-deficient mutant strain304. This enzyme is involved in the biosynthesis of dihydroxynaphthalene melanin, which is believed to have protective qualities that fungi use to withstand the extreme conditions of space305. This suggests thatKnufiaspecies, and potentially other black fungi have the properties to withstand space conditions and are good candidates for plastic degradation in space. Since then, various other extremophilic fungi have been tested for their survival in space, through exposure to simulated Mars conditions306,307. These include 12 Chernobyl-isolated strains (i.e.,Cladosporium,Acremonium,Beauveria,Fusarium,Trichoderma,Penicillium,Aureobasidium,AspergillusandApiospora), the black fungiExophiala jeanselmei, and the microcolonial fungiCryomyces antarcticusandKnufia perforans. Plastic degradation has also been investigated in extremophilic bacteria, for exampleStreptomyces thermoviolaceus,Geobacillus thermocatenulatusandClostridium thermocellum308. As these extremophilic fungi and bacteria have been shown to withstand space conditions, thus they are promising candidates to use or engineer for plastic degradation in space. Ultimately, the capacity for manufacturing in space will be beneficial for long-duration space missions, reducing the need to bring materials as cargo or have them launched from Earth, and allowing for on-demand production of materials based on immediate need. Astronauts venturing out beyond Earth’s protective magnetosphere will be exposed to hazardous radiation during deep-space exploration missions. This includes high-energy electromagnetic waves from our sun such as UV radiation, gamma, and X-rays or sub-atomic particles from the cosmos (electrons, protons, neutrons, and heavy metal ions), known as galactic cosmic radiation. These forms of radiation strip electrons from molecules resulting in protein or DNA damage through production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species309,310. The result is short-term or long-term health problems such as cancer, acute radiation sickness, radiation-induced cardiovascular disease, and neurological damage278. Developing a solution for passive radiation protection for astronauts will be a critical step towards sustaining long-term presence on the Moon and Mars. The average person on Earth is exposed to about 6.2 mSv of radiation over a period of a year, while the average astronaut on the ISS is exposed to approximately 144 mSv311. One year into a three-year mission to Mars, an astronaut would already have been exposed to some 400 mSv of radiation311,312. Due to the complex nature of space radiation, there is likely no one-size-fits-all solution to this problem. Some proposed architectural concepts for radiation production include building below ground in lava tubes or piling meters of regolith outside of a structure313,314and while materials like lead and aluminum may be effective, they would be costly to transport315. As a result, the search for innovative radiation shields will depend in part on biotechnology, which holds unique advantages such as suitability for ISRU, self-regeneration, and adaptability. By selecting model organisms such as extremophiles, that use radiation as an energy source, we can begin to understand their properties and refine testing for technology development. Fungi on Earth have been isolated in high-radiation environments, such as the contamination zone of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant316,317, inside the ISS317, and exteriors of spacecraft in LEO305. Analogous to phototrophy, fungi appear to perform radiosynthesis, using pigments known as melanin to convert gamma radiation into chemical energy318,319. Melanin has the capability to absorb electromagnetic radiation, resist acids, and perform powerful antioxidant activity allowing some fungi to thrive in the most extreme environments on Earth or beyond, including those with high levels of ionizing radiation320,321. Studies examining the survival rates of melanized and non-melanized yeasts with gamma radiation have shown that melanin-rich fungi were able to shield ionizing radiation at efficacies comparable to lead and twice as effective as charcoal, whereas the non-melanized strains lacked the capability to provide shielding322. This may not only be due to the presence of melanin itself but the spatial arrangement of it within the cell, as it was observed that inCryptococcus neoformans, melanin arranged in a spherical shape, covering the inner surface of the cell membrane, resulted in superior shielding from radiation323, hypothesized to be due to the increase in scattering of incident photons318. Melanin is not the sole mechanism by which fungi survive radiation exposure. In a study using melanized yeastExophiala dermatitidis, it was found that nutrient availability, culture density, metabolic state and DNA repair mechanisms were better determinants of cell survival after gamma radiation exposure than melanin324. Other mechanisms that protect fungi against radiation involve enzymes that remove reactive oxygen species or those that promote DNA repair, either through nucleotide excision or photoreactivation325, and various other secondary metabolites, such as the antioxidant pyranonigrin A326. Due to the ability of various fungi to withstand, thrive, and even attenuate space-relevant doses of radiation306,316,318,327–330there is keen interest in their use for the development of radiation-resistant shields or structures305,330–332. Fungal mycelium, a filamentous network of hyphae, is a fibrous material that can be used as structural components for the construction of habitats, buildings, furniture, etc.333. Fungal mycelium as a construction material has attractive characteristics including self-healing potential, impressive compressive strength, flexibility, insulation, and hydrophobicity333. The use of mycelium-based materials and structures in space would be a sustainable, biodegradable option with demonstrated uses for generating textiles332and as an alternative to plastic packaging. Haneef et al. used two edible and medicinal fungi,Ganoderma lucidumandPleurotus ostreatus, to produce mycelium films composed of polysaccharides, lipids, protein, and chitin334. The fungi were grown on two different substrates; cellulose or cellulose with PDB, and the final composition and characteristics of the film differed based on which substrate they were exposed to334. This suggests that myco-architecture properties could be modulated simply by varying the growth substrate. Biocomposites combining fungal mycelium with cellulose plant fibers335or with wood and cellulose nanofibrils have also been investigated336. Since they are living organisms, synthetic biology could be used to engineer fungi to secrete other useful structural components such as polymers, for even more complex structures. Indeed, CRISPR-Cas9 methodology has been used to create gene deletions inPaecilomyces variotii, a Chernobyl fungal isolate, and was used to identify the gene responsible for its radiation resistance337. This technology could be further employed to enhance various fungi for deep space applications, such as making them better suited for radiation shielding. Another promising construction material to shield humans, plants and (possibly even) animals from the harsh Lunar and Martian environments is concrete. Concrete is a promising material for space applications as it is strong (it has proven to be the most durable material against natural disasters and extreme weather events), resistant to burns, rust and rot and could be made with engineered microbes and in situ resources. Concrete is composed of three main components: water, cement, and an aggregate (i.e., sand, gravel). Researchers have discovered that the use of human serum albumin combined with regolith from the Moon or Mars as the concrete aggregate can produce a concrete-like biocomposite that is made even stronger with the addition of urea338. Alternatives for cement, one of the main components of concrete, can be made using engineered bacteria to express recombinant or structural proteins, such as bovine or human serum albumin339and spider silk340. This way, protein production and purification can be scaled-up and ultimately mixed with in situ regolith, rather than extracting them directly from the source. Microbes can further aid in the production of concrete through soil biocementation using microbially induced calcite precipitation (MICP)341. This is a process wherein microorganisms precipitate calcium carbonate, the main component of limestone and cement, by urea hydrolysis or CO2-concentration341. For this reason, candidate microbes are typically highly urease-active bacteria, such asSporosarcina pasteurii(formerly known asBacillus pasteurii)342,343. One of the limitations of concrete is that it can often crack due to shrinkage. Incorporation of microorganisms into these structures can provide a sustainable solution for in-space construction but also a long-term biotechnological solution for concrete maintenance through crack remediation. Bacteria embedded in the concrete, resulting in what is often termed “living” or “self-healing” concrete, can repair cracks that form over time through the precipitation of calcium carbonate crystals344. This has been investigated using microorganisms including microalgae (SynechococcusandSpirulina)345,346,Bacillus347, andDeinococcus radiodurans348. Concrete is a harsh, alkaline environment (~pH 12) and therefore relies on hardy microbes tolerant of these conditions. The ability forBacillusto form spores and its resistance to alkaline conditions makes this microbe a promising candidate for survival in the high pH concrete environment. Concrete remediation using MICP by spore-formingBacillusspecies was demonstrated by Ramachandran et al.349and later by Jonkers et al., who demonstrated that the spores remained viable for up to four months350. While this is a promising start, experiments need to be performed to determine whether bacterial spores can remain viable for longer durations. TheB. subtilisgene cluster and molecular mechanism involved in calcium carbonate biomineralization have been identified351and therefore could be used to engineer novel bacteria with enhanced self-healing capabilities or resistance to the concrete environment. Negative impact of microbes and mitigation strategies While microbes offer many benefits and biotechnological solutions for extended spaceflight and the development of sustainable habitats beyond LEO, they can also have a negative impact on space exploration. This can manifest as increased microbial pathogenicity, horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of problematic genes, and biofilm formation which have direct effects on crew health and spacecraft integrity. Understanding how microbes respond to the space environment, will allow for mitigation strategies to be developed and implemented, to ensure successful long-duration space exploration. Several studies have demonstrated that the conditions and stress of spaceflight can enhance microbial virulence or pathogenicity, as has been observed with many human-associated pathogens either grown or isolated on the ISS and/or in simulated microgravity conditions. Examples includeKlebsiella pneumonia354,P. aeruginosa355,Salmonella entericaserovar Typhimurium356,357,Serratia marcescens358, enterotoxigenicE. coli359, andAspergillus fumigatus360. The presence of microorganisms with heightened virulence could increase the risk of crewmembers contracting infections, even more problematic due dysregulated immunity during spaceflight179.S. typhimuriumgrown under modeled microgravity (MMG)356and in spaceflight357showed increased virulence compared to ground controls as demonstrated by an increased mortality rate in a murine infection model. Similarly,S. marcescens358and the pathogenic fungi,Aspergillus fumigatus360, grown on the ISS or in simulated microgravity exhibited enhanced virulence compared to terrestrial strains and were more lethal in aDrosophilaand zebrafish model, respectively. The specific mechanism responsible for increased microbial virulence in space conditions is still under investigation but genes with altered expression in-flight may contribute to this virulence response. These include biofilm-associated genes which were found to be upregulated inS. typhimurium(e.g.,wca/wzagenes for colanic acid synthesis,ompA,fimH) and bacterial motility genes which were downregulated361. In addition, transcriptional, and proteomic analysis ofP. aeruginosaidentified genes that were upregulated in spaceflight including virulence- and adhesin-associated lectin genes (lecAandlecB) andrhlAwhich is involved in biosurfactant production355. However, the most common factor contributing to space-induced virulence seems to be transcriptional regulation by Hfq, the expression of which was shown to be decreased under both low shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) and spaceflight conditions inS. typhimurium361,362andP. aeruginosa355,363. Hfq is an RNA chaperone and global transcriptional regulator responsible for controlling the expression of a large array of genes and is necessary for the virulence of several bacterial pathogens355. Consistent with previous studies,hfqwas found to be downregulated inS. aureusgrown in LSMMG, however, unlike previous studies the virulence potential was reduced364. Microorganisms in the space environment, as on Earth, can exist in a planktonic (freely suspended) state, but more commonly form robust biofilms as a tactic for growth and survival. A biofilm is an assemblage of surface-associated microbial cells surrounded by an extracellular matrix of polysaccharides, extracellular DNA (eDNA), proteins, lipids, and other components, with a defined architecture372,373. Biofilm-associated organisms differ from their planktonic counterparts with respect to the genes that are transcribed, proteins that are translated and growth rate372. Although most bacterial biofilms are harmless, some threaten human health and safety and can be difficult to eradicate due to increased resistance to the immune system’s defenses, UV radiation, extreme temperatures, pH, high salinity, high pressure, limited nutrients, and various antimicrobials374,375. Microbially influenced corrosion (MIC), refers to the deterioration of metals and nonmetallic materials due to microbial activity, most often due to biofilms. As biofilms increase in quantity more microbial-surface reactions occur, enhancing structural and/or functional damage, causing accelerated biocorrosion380. In a recent Microbial Tracking study (MT-1) of the ISS, the bacterial bioburden quantified from various surfaces was as high as 109CFU/m2381. Some of the biofilm-forming microorganisms that were identified,Methylobacterium, Sphingomonas, Bacillus, Penicillium, andAspergillushave been implicated in MIC on Earth382–385withBacillus polymira,Penicillium rubensandAspergillussp. responsible for progressive destruction of a navigation window on board Mir386.Sphingomonas sp. andMethylobacterium sp. have not only been detected on surfaces but also in portable drinking water on the ISS387. Over the course of 15 years (from its launch in 1986 to 2001), 234 species of bacteria and fungi were identified onboard the MIR space station, with many exhibiting potential polymer biodegradation properties388. Biofilm growth has been observed in the Soviet/Russian (Salyuts and Mir), American (Skylab), and International (ISS) Space Stations. Aboard spacecraft, biofilms can jeopardize vital equipment and threaten astronaut health by corroding surfaces or clogging life-support systems including air and water purification systems, spacesuits, navigation windows and radiators368,389–392. Most notable on the ISS, is the microbial contamination and biofilm formation that occurs in the wastewater tank of the Water Recovery System (WRS), which is a part of the Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS) and used to process wastewater from various sources (i.e., urine, cabin condensate) into potable water for crew and other functions393. For future planned missions beyond LEO to the Moon and Mars, resupplying spare parts or support materials to repair the listed spaceflight systems would be impractical as missions could be in the order of years, in the case of a Mars missions, thus various strategies to control biofilms, especially in critical life support systems are essential394. Ways to detect, monitor and control biofilms are being explored, such as the current spaceflight BAC (Bacterial Adhesion and Corrosion) study. The aim of this study is to identify bacterial genes relevant to biofilm growth in space, examine whether the formed biofilms corrode stainless steel surfaces mimicking those in the ISS water system, and determine whether silver-based disinfectants can prevent or control extensive biofilm formation. Biofilm formation is an important characteristic in the infectious disease process of microorganisms. It has been demonstrated that bacteria can genetically and physically modify their tolerances to LEO conditions, with one such mechanism being biofilm formation395–397. Human opportunistic pathogens that form or increase biofilms under simulated microgravity conditions or when grown on the ISS includeE. coli,S. typhimurium, P.aeruginosaandMicrococcus luteus379,398. It has also been observed that many species of bacteria and fungi become more antibiotic resistant and pathogenic when exposed or grown in spaceflight conditions174. In cases ofS. typhimurium17andP. aeruginosa355, the observed increased virulence (discussed earlier in this review) was attributed to molecular and phenotypic changes consistent with biofilm formation. In the case ofKlebsiella pneumoniaegrown aboard the Shenzhou VIII spacecraft, the enhanced antibiotic resistance was associated with adaptations related to biofilm formation354,399. As biofilm formation can increase the risk of human illnesses, through harder-to-treat infections, biofilm properties under space conditions need to be well understood to enable safe, long-duration, human space missions. This is even more imperative considering the immune dysregulation of astronauts and lower efficacy of pharmaceuticals during spaceflight174. The ability for bacteria to survive or even thrive in the spaceflight environment, with potentially increased pathogenicity and biofilm formation, may be attributed to DNA transfer. Horizontal gene transfer (HGT), also known as lateral gene transfer, is the movement of genetic material from one organism to another by means other than sexual reproduction or vertical transfer from a parent cell. This typically occurs through one of three main mechanisms: direct contact of microbial cells by a pilus (i.e., conjugation), natural DNA uptake from the environment (i.e., transformation), or introduction by bacteriophages (i.e., transduction)405–407. More recently, gene transfer agents and membrane vesicles are being recognized for their contributions to HGT as well408. HGT is central to microbial evolution because it allows microorganisms to acquire novel genetic material, which may confer a fitness advantage to adapt to or thrive within a specific environment22,409–411. Prevalence of HGT in the spaceflight environment The human gut houses a diverse microbial population with ecologically favorable conditions for HGT given its continuous supply of nutrients and consistent environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, pH)14. Phylogeny-based research suggests that over the course of their evolution, more than half of total genes in the genomes of human-associated microbiota were introduced by HGT419. While HGT is a normal occurrence within the human microbiome, an increased number of transfer events passing AMR genes from commensal bacteria to opportunistic pathogens during spaceflight could cause changes in these microbial communities175. These transfer events have been investigated inStaphylococcus epidermidis, a bacterium normally present in the human epithelial microbiome, which harbors the methicillin resistance genemecAon a mobile genetic element. HGT was found to be an important factor for the acquisition ofmecAby the pathogenS. aureus, leading to methicillin-resistantS. aureus(MRSA)420,421. Recent research has also demonstrated the transfer of AMR and virulence-associated genes from commensalE. colito pathogenicE. coli422. The transfer of AMR genes can cause increased bacterial resistance and virulence, which could have significant health implications423,424for astronauts due to their dysregulated immunity on long-duration space missions425. Numerous studies have shown that HGT is the common mechanism by which AMR genes are disseminated within an environment, leading to the emergence of multi-drug resistant bacteria426–428, which limits treatment options for bacterial infections. As previously discussed, biofilms can be detrimental to spacecraft and astronaut health; thus, understanding the factors that can influence biofilm formation will be imperative for predicting, preventing, and mitigating spacecraft contamination. HGT may contribute to biofilms as their formation can be induced by conjugative plasmids that express factors to enhance cell-to-cell contact and pilus formation. Conjugative pili can act as adhesion factors as demonstrated by Ghigo who monitored biofilm formation on Pyrex slides submerged in cultures ofE. coliK12. They observed that strains carrying a conjugative F plasmid (F+) formed thick biofilms after one day (2 × 1010CFU/cm2), while plasmid-free strains (F−) only formed microcolonies (8 × 105CFU/cm2)435. Conjugative pili specifically were shown to be a contributing factor to biofilm formation as strains carrying plasmids with mutations in the pilin gene,traA, were unable to form biofilms435. Reisner et al. confirmed Ghigo’s findings as the presence of the F plasmid pOX38 inE. coliled to the formation of mushroom-shaped biofilms with increased biomass, surface coverage and thickness compared to F- controls436. To further analyze the contribution of the pilus to this phenotype, the authors created plasmid mutants for several of the genes required for pilus synthesis:traQ,traX,traD,traS, andtraT436. Mutants involved in pilus assembly and modification (i.e.,traQ, traX) displayed a weak biofilm phenotype similar to the plasmid-free strain (traQ) or decreased biomass and thickness (traX), while those involved in DNA transfer (i.e.,traD) displayed rapid confluent growth and tower-like structures436. In a different study performed with 403 naturalE. coliisolates researchers observed biofilm formation in 56 isolates and of those, 89% contained conjugative plasmids437. These recipients of conjugative plasmids were able to induce biofilms to a greater extent than their plasmid-free controls437. Finally, one study validated that conjugative plasmids enhanced biofilm formation but concluded that this did not directly correlate with conjugation frequency for all plasmids tested, suggesting other factors may be involved438. Other studies suggest that conjugative plasmid-encoded fimbriae, biofilm-associated pili, and cell wall-anchoring proteins can also increase biofilm formation. Type III fimbriae encoded as accessory proteins on conjugative plasmids have been demonstrated to mediate cell–cell and cell-surface adhesion439, as well as increased biofilm formation440inK. pneumoniae441. Further evidence of this was demonstrated in a uropathogenic strain ofE. coliwhere Tn5 mutagenesis was used to identify biofilm-deficient mutants442. All Tn5 insertions were found to be within the type III fimbriae genes (mrkABCDF) encoded on the conjugative plasmid pMAS2027. This suggests that type III fimbriae were necessary for biofilm formation which was confirmed when this locus was cloned into biofilm-deficient mutants and was able to restore biofilm formation442. When analyzed in a space environment it appears that pili and fimbriae contribute to increased biofilm formation in the short term but decreased biofilm formation in the long term. In a spaceflight study, researchers compared biofilm formation ofAcinetobacter schindleriover a short duration (15 days) and long-duration (64 days) from the Shenzhou-10 spacecraft and Tiangong-2 space lab, respectively443. They observed reduced biofilm formation after 64 days and following transcriptional analysis proposed that this reduction was potentially due to downregulation of thepilandalgRgenes associated with conjugative pili and alginate biosynthesis, or upregulation of genes involved in metal iron binding (as available iron increases biofilm formation)443. In another study analyzingProteus mirabilisbiofilm formation following short-term or long-term SMG, researchers found that long-term exposure resulted in downregulation of genes associated with fimbriae, impeding adhesion, and ultimately decreasing biofilm formation444. Fig. 4. Interplay between bacterial HGT, biofilms, and virulence in space. In microgravity, bacterial HGT can increase cell–cell adhesion, and production of eDNA and extracellular polysaccharides contributing to increased biofilm formation. Reciprocally, biofilms promote HGT as they contain high microbial diversity and an ECM structure allowing for increased cell aggregation, stable mating pair formation and eDNA accumulation. Both HGT and biofilms increase bacterial virulence through cellular adhesion and dissemination of antimicrobial resistance, and increased biomass and resistance to disinfectants, respectively.

Harnessing HGT as a tool for genetic engineering Within the next decade, great strides will be made in space exploration with the combined efforts of NASA and other space agencies to reach the Moon and Mars, as well as the expansion of commercialized spaceflight. The Artemis missions will work towards establishing a lunar base camp by 2025 with the purpose of utilizing the Moon as a precursor to Mars exploration. These missions will involve long-duration spaceflight and prolonged extraterrestrial occupation, requiring further exploration of health risks and resource sustainability than what was needed for the decades spent in LEO on the ISS. This review has discussed the role of microbes and their beneficial or detrimental impacts on long-duration space missions as demonstrated in Earth-based simulated space environments or experiments conducted in spaceflight. Microbes heavily contribute to the success of our ecosystem on Earth and can therefore be repurposed for the space environment to help generate a sustainable habitat. We have summarized the advantageous properties of microbes in plant cultivation, wastewater treatment, solid and liquid waste reuse, and atmospheric revitalization. This review has also considered the use of microbial fuel cells to generate energy from waste, plant decay, and solar light conversion. Although more research is needed for efficient energy conversion in the space environment, we present microbial fuel cells as an ideal and possible future alternative for energy generation. We also examined the advantages of bioengineered microbes for in-flight therapeutics, increased production of nutrients and oxygen, and the creation or recycling of infrastructure materials. Most of these microbial technologies have been successfully demonstrated on Earth, but as suggested, should be further tested, and applied in the space environment. Microbes are ideal candidates to aid in human survival during long-term space travel due to their many beneficial characteristics, ease of manipulation, and microscopic size, allowing them to be easily stowed without the concern of added weight. In terms of health and safety risks, the possibility of increased microbial virulence and pathogenicity in spaceflight was discussed, as well as the detrimental effects of increased HGT and biofilm formation on astronaut health and equipment integrity. Suggestions were also made regarding mitigation strategies for further investigation, including antimicrobial metallic surface materials and coatings that prevent increased HGT or biofilm formation. This review has presented the vast contributions that microbes can make towards future crewed missions, human habitability and sustainability and hopefully encourages more space-related microbial research interconnected with technological development, to continue to safely advance deep space exploration in the upcoming decade.
