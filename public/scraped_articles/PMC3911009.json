Received 2013 Sep 17; Accepted 2013 Oct 10. The roles of various core components, including α/β/γ-type small acid-soluble spore proteins (SASP), dipicolinic acid (DPA), core water content, and DNA repair by apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonucleases or nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), inBacillus subtilisspore resistance to different types of ionizing radiation including X rays, protons, and high-energy charged iron ions have been studied. Spores deficient in DNA repair by NHEJ or AP endonucleases, the oxidative stress response, or protection by major α/β-type SASP, DPA, and decreased core water content were significantly more sensitive to ionizing radiation than wild-type spores, with highest sensitivity to high-energy-charged iron ions. DNA repair via NHEJ and AP endonucleases appears to be the most important mechanism for spore resistance to ionizing radiation, whereas oxygen radical detoxification via the MrgA-mediated oxidative stress response or KatX catalase activity plays only a very minor role. Synergistic radioprotective effects of α/β-type but not γ-type SASP were also identified, indicating that α/β-type SASP's binding to spore DNA is important in preventing DNA damage due to reactive oxygen species generated by ionizing radiation. Bacterial strains, growth, sporulation, and spore purification. B. subtilisstrains used in this study Cmr, resistant to chloramphenicol (5 μg/ml). α−β−, spores lack SASP-α and -β and thus ∼80% of the spore's pool of α/β-type SASP (35). Spcr, resistant to spectinomycin (100 μg/ml). Tetr, resistant to tetracycline (10 μg/ml). Neor, resistant to neomycin (10 μg/ml). Ermr, resistant to erythromycin (1 μg/ml). Measurement of spore resistance to ionizing radiation. Spore survival was determined from appropriate dilutions in distilled water as colony-forming ability after incubation overnight at 37°C on nutrient broth (NB) agar plates (Difco, Detroit, MI, USA) (33,34,36). The surviving fraction ofB. subtilisspores was determined from the ratioN/N0, whereNis the number of CFU of the irradiated sample andN0that of the nonirradiated controls. Spore inactivation curves were obtained as described previously (34). Data are reported asD10-values, the dose of ionizing radiation killing 90% of the initial spore population (34). All data are expressed as averages ± standard deviations (n= 3). The significance of the differences in the survival rates and relative sensitivities were determined by analysis of variance (ANOVA), using SigmaPlot software Version 12.0 (Systat Software GmbH, Erkrath, Germany). Values were evaluated in multigroup pairwise combinations, and differences withPvalues of <0.05 were considered statistically significant (33,34,36). Role of spore core components in ionizing radiation resistance. Spore resistance to irradiation with X rays (A), protons (B), and high-energy charged Fe ions (C). Spores differing in various core components, including major α/β-type SASP, the single γ-type SASP, and Ca-DPA (due to loss of DPA synthetase encoded byspoVF), or core water content (due to thedacBmutation), with (white bars) and without (gray bars) protection by α/β-type SASP. Spores were irradiated in water, andD10values are expressed as averages ± standard deviations (n= 3) as described in the text. Lowercase letters above the bars denote groups significantly different by ANOVA (P< 0.05). Note the differences in theyaxes of panels A, B, and C. Impact of spore core-specific components on spore resistance to different types of ionizing radiation: X rays (A), protons (B), and high-energy charged Fe ions (C) with (white bars) and without (gray bars) protection by α/β-type SASP. Relative spore sensitivity was expressed as the ratio of theD10value of spores of each mutant strain to theD10value of spores of the corresponding reference strain (wild-type or α−β−) from each irradiation, using data fromFig. 1. Data are averages and standard deviations (n= 3). Actual data values are given above the corresponding columns inFig. 1. Lowercase letters next to the bars denote groups significantly different by ANOVA (P< 0.05). Role of oxidative stress responses and DNA repair in spore ionizing radiation resistance. Spore resistance to irradiation with X rays (A), protons (B), and high-energy charged Fe ions (C). Spores deficient in radical detoxification by SodA (superoxide dismutase), KatX (major spore catalase), DNA protection by MrgA (oxidative stress resistance DNA-binding protein), DNA repair by ExoA and Nfo, or YkoV and YkoU (with [white bars] and without [gray bars] protection by α/β-type SASP), were exposed in water, andD10values are expressed as averages ± standard deviations (n= 3) as described in the text. Lowercase letters above the bars denote groups significantly different by ANOVA (P< 0.05). Note the differences in theyaxes of panels A, B, and C. Relative ionizing radiation sensitivities of spores lacking radical detoxification by SodA or KatX, DNA protection by MrgA, or DNA repair by ExoA plus Nfo or YkoV plus YkoU to X rays (A), protons (B), and high-energy charged Fe ions (C) with (white bars) and without (gray bars) protection by α/β-type SASP. Relative spore sensitivity is expressed as the ratio of theD10value of spores of each mutant strain to theD10value of spores of the corresponding reference strain (wild-type or α−β−) from each irradiation, using data fromFig. 3. Data are averages and standard deviations (n= 3). Actual data values are given above the corresponding columns. Lowercase letters next to the bars denote groups significantly different by ANOVA (P< 0.05). Spores appear to have two possible ways to minimize deleterious effects of ionizing radiation: (i) by protecting dormant spore DNA from damage in the first place (Fig. 1and2) and (ii) by ensuring detoxification and repair of direct and indirect damage during spore germination (Fig. 3and4). Because ionizing radiation causes such a wide spectrum of direct and indirect DNA damage, it will be interesting to determine the contributions of additional error-free and error-prone DNA repair pathways (e.g., mismatch repair, translesion synthesis, and homologous recombination [29,42–44]), to gain further detailed insights into spore resistance to ionizing radiation.
