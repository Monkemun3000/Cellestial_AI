Understanding the response of plants to varied gravitational conditions is vital for developing effective food production in space bioregenerative life support systems. This study examines the impact of altered gravity conditions on the growth and morphological responses ofWolffia globosa(commonly known as “water lentils” or “duckweed”), assessing its potential as a space crop. Although an experiment testing the effect of simulated microgravity on Wolffia globosa has been previously conducted, for the first time, we investigated the effect of multiple gravity levels on the growth and morphological traits ofWolffia globosaplants. The plant responses to simulated microgravity, simulated partial gravity (Moon), and hypergravity environments were evaluated using random positioning machines and the large-diameter centrifuge. As hypothesized, we observed a slight reaction to different gravitational levels in the growth and morphological traits of Wolffia globosa. The relative growth rates (RGR) of plants subjected to simulated microgravity and partial gravity were reduced when compared to those in other gravity levels. The morphological analysis revealed differences in plant dimensions and frond length-to-width ratios under diverse gravity conditions. Our findings showed that Wolffia globosa is responsive to gravitational changes, with its growth and morphological adaptations being slightly influenced by varying gravitational environments. As for other crop species, growth was reduced by the microgravity conditions; however, RGR remained substantial at 0.33 a day. In conclusion, this study underscores the potential ofWolffia globosaas a space crop and its adaptability to diverse gravitational conditions, contributing to the development of sustainable food production and bioregenerative life support systems for future space exploration missions. Subject terms:Plant sciences, Light responses, Photosynthesis, Plant development Wolffia globosa, commonly known as “water lentils” is a member of theWolffoideaesubfamily within theLemnaceaefamily, shares similar biological traits with itsLemnoideaerelatives: it is the smallest flowering plant and shows the fastest growth rate in the plant kingdom and lacks a pseudo root system1,2. Due to its rapid growth rate, high protein content, and nutritional value, it has emerged as a promising candidate for sustainable food production, particularly in agriculturally challenging regions3–6. This unique plant has recently garnered attention also as a potential bioregenerative life support system (BLSS) candidate7, offering traits that align with closed-loop, resource-efficient systems like those adopted for the ESA MELiSSA Loop8. Nevertheless, as for other candidate space crops9,10to assess the suitability ofWolffia’sin space cultivation and its ability to recycle resources efficiently, further laboratory tests investigating growth, nutrition, and genetic responses under extreme conditions are fundamental7. Studying the effects of various stimuli, including different gravity environments, radiations, and their interactions, on the growth and development of plants can be challenging and costly7,11. Space limitations within onboard test facilities, such as the International Space Station or orbiting vectors, often restrict the number of replicates, making studies under these conditions even more demanding12–14. However, cost-effective alternatives exist in the form of facilities that simulate microgravity and partial gravity levels by continuously altering the gravitational vector15–17. These facilities offer higher replicate numbers and serve as robust testbeds for experiments involving different gravity levels18,19. Hypergravity, characterized by gravitational forces greater than Earth’s standard 1 g, is a significant factor in space exploration, affecting humans, and plant life20,21. Hypergravity is most prominent during the manuvers of take-off and landing phases of spacecraft. These brief yet intense episodes of increased gravitational force can influence various aspects of plant biology and growth21. Understanding how plants respond to hypergravity is essential for optimizing their cultivation in space environments and for Earth’s agriculture22,23. Furthermore, it provides valuable insights into the mechanisms plants employ to withstand and adapt to extreme gravitational conditions24,25. Earlier studies under simulated microgravity have shown stable anatomical morphology inWolffiaplants26, possible effects of hypergravity on plant growth and reproduction have not yet been investigated. Testing plant reactions of potential space crops under varying gravity levels, including those experienced during take-off, landing, or in partial gravities, is reported as crucial27. Consequently, exploring the adaptability ofWolffiaplants under different gravitational conditions significantly contributes to our understanding of their potential7. Recent genome sequencing ofWolffia australianahas shed light on the gravity-sensing mechanisms and photomorphogenesis inWolffiaplants28,29. Due to the loss of gravity sensing genes in the sister speciesWolffia australiana, we also hypothesised forWolffia globosaa lack of the gravity sensing mechanisms, resulting in a reduced effect of the different gravity levels on the growth and morphological characteristics. More specifically, we aim to study the effects of altered gravity conditions on the growth and morphology ofWolffia globosa. Leveraging the capabilities of random positioning machines and large-diameter centrifuges, we simulated microgravity, partial gravity (Moon), and hypergravity conditions to comprehensively explore the impact of varying gravitational environments on this plant species. These machines allow us to generate and study a range of gravity conditions, thereby elucidatingWolffia globosa's responses to these diverse gravity environments and assessing its potential utilisation in space-based food production systems. Plant material and cultivation Plants ofWolffia globosa(9910) have been provided by Prof. Klaus Apperoth from the Department of Plant Physiology of the University of Jena, Germany. Upon receive, plant material was surface sterilised with 0.3% bleach/water solution for 5 min30. After 14 days from disinfection, plants were subcultured for 30 days in N-medium30under axenic conditions. Therefore, plant material has been transferred under a laminar flow hood in sets of 6-well plates, each filled with 5 ml of N-medium solution and sealed with micropore® tape. Before the experimental run, plants were acclimatised for 24 h at 30 °C. After acclimatisation, an average of 20 ± 4 fronds were transferred in each well of a 6-multiwell plate previously filled with 5 ml of N-medium and 0.8% of Agar to achieve a semi-solid substrate. The experiment was conducted at 30 ± 0.5 °C average temperature with a photoperiod of 16/8 h light/dark and a total Photon Flux Density (PFD) of 72.37 ± 10.30 μmol m−2s−1for 168 h2. Carbon dioxide concentration has been monitored throughout the experiment, resulting in an average concentration of 303 ± 34 ppm. Hardware description and dimensions Experimental hardware has been developed to hold two multiwell plates in a setup that minimises the gravity gradient between the upper and lower multiwell plates. Furthermore, the experimental hardware had to be designed to fit in most test facilities, setting the lower constraints to an overall dimension of 15*15*15 cm of the smallest Random Positioning Machine (RPM) available.. Considering these constraints, we designed and developed the experimental hardware using the free available software SketchUp® (Fig.1). Due to the constraints described before, multiwell plates had to be stacked vertically. This setup minimises the distance of the two centres of mass of both multiwells so that the difference in acceleration can be neglected. The experimental hardware has been equipped with LED white light (Goming LTD) to ensure proper plant development. Experimental hardware: (A) In the Front view, the black arrows show the LED light strips, the star shapes marks the biological containers (multiwell plates), and the triangular shape marks the base plate of the experimental hardware. (B) Assembled hardware from a back view, the red arrows points at the 30 mm fan re-circulating air within the experimental hardware. The inner dimension of each experimental hardware is designed to fit a multiwell plate of standard dimensions (12.7 × 8.5 × 2.2 cm). From the multiwell lid to the lighting system, a fixed distance of 2.0 cm has been set up to guarantee optimal light intensity for plant growth. The experimental hardware's design and dimensions are reported below (Fig.2). Experimental hardware, with the exact dimensions of every component. Light treatment has been achieved utilising two 10 cm 5 V LED stripes illuminating each multiwell plate (Fig.1). Via USB connector, the light was connected to a Wi-Fi USB switch that controlled the lighting system and photoperiod to a 16/8 light/dark cycle. Light emission spectrum has been determined with a spectroradiometer (SS-110, Apogee Instruments Inc.) measuring in six different positions within the experimental hardware (N = 6) in a wavelength range of 340–820 nm. A more detailed composition of the light spectrum is described in Table1and Fig.3. The following parameters are expressed in total photon flux density (PFD) (μmol m−2s−1), photosynthetic photon flux (PPF) (μmol s−1), yield photon flux (YPF) (μmol s−1), and photosynthetic photon efficacy (PPE); red-to-far red ratio (R/FR).

Dotted lines limit the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). The study encompassed four different gravity treatments: simulated microgravity, simulated partial gravity (Moon), and two levels of hypergravity (2gad 4g). In addition, a control group under Earth gravity conditions was included for comparison (Fig.4). Experimental hardware implementation. The different images show the implementation of the experimental hardware in the different gravity treatments. (A) RPM simulated partial gravity (Moon) (B) Simulated microgravity (sim-µg) (c) LDC gondola implemented with the experimental hardware within the LDC. Simulated microgravity (sim-µg) was achieved using an RPM (Random Positioning Machine, original Dutch Space Leiden, NL; currently Yuri Space, Meckenbeuren, DE) that allowed the plants to be positioned within 10 cm from the centre of rotation. The RPM was set to a maximum random speed of 60 °/s, minimising residual acceleration31. RPM was also set to random interval and random direction. Simulated Partial gravity (Moon) (sim-Moon) was simulated using a similar RPM, which was running a different program which does not provide a complete random rotation during the experiment but generates vector orientations and values that are biased such that the averaged resulted gravity vector simulates the Moon. This proprietary software generated motion can enabled the examination of plant responses to partial gravity ranging from nearly zero to 0.9 g levels27. Hypergravity conditions were obtained using the large-diameter centrifuge (LDC)32. Two hypergravity levels were tested: 2gand 4g, corresponding to twice and four times the gravitational force on Earth, respectively. These conditions allowed investigation of howWolffia globosaresponded to increased gravitational forces. A control group was included, where plants were grown under normal gravity conditions (1g) in a static gondola. This control group served as a baseline for comparing the growth and morphology ofWolffia globosaunder different gravity treatments. The experimental setup and the number of replicates for each treatment are summarised in Table2: Gravity treatments and replicates. We collected data by imaging the multiwell plates at two-time points: the beginning of the experiment (t0) and after 168 h (t168). Camera Setup: a Sony Alpha II camera with an 18–70 mm objective was fixed to a camera stand. It captured top-down images of the multiwell plate placed on a lighting table with a white semi-transparent Polyvinyl chloride panel illuminated by an LED light panel, ensuring uniform lighting conditions. The images thaken with this setup were used to evaluate growth. Morespecificaly, the relative growth rate (RGR) was calculated by comparing the area occupied by the plants in pixels at the start of the experiment (t0) and after 168 h (t168). Doubling time (DT) was determined based on RGR. Stereo Microscope Setup: detailed morphological analysis was performed using a Leica® MZ8 Stereo zoom Microscope. Images representing replicates for each treatment were captured. Images acquired with the steromicroscope were used to evaluate the morphological traits ofWolffia globosawere compared among gravity treatments. Morphological traits, such as the dimensions of the long and short axes of the mother fronds, were measured using Fiji® software. Ratios between the long and short axes of the mother fronds were also calculated to assess frond roundness. Wolffia globosaplant. The dotted line divides the daughter frond (DF) from the mother frond (MF). The (LS) arrow shows the long side, and the (SS) arrow shows the short side. Image analysis data were processed and analysed using SPSS Statistics ver. 21 (IBM Corp.). Differences in growth and morphological traits ofWolffia globosaamong gravity treatments was assessed by one-way ANOVA (p< 0.05). Pairwise comparisons were performed using Tukey's post-hoc test (P< 0.05) to identify differences among individual treatments. Experimental studies and field research on plants (cultivated or wild), including the collection of plant material, must comply with relevant institutional, national and international guidelines and legislation. We will strictly adhere to the IUCN Policy Statement on Research on Endangered Species and the Convention on Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. Prof. Klaus Apperoth provided specimens in this utilised in this study from the Department of Plant Physiology of the University of Jena, Germany and are available in the collection of the up mentioned university. We confirm compliance with the IUCN policy for plant. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed a significant difference (F = 16.47,p< 0.001) for the RGR among the different gravity treatments. The Eta-squared and Epsilon-squared effect sizes indicated a large effect of the treatments on the RGR (Eta-squared = 0.54, Epsilon-squared = 0.51). The post hoc 'Tukey's test, conducted to determine the specific differences between the treatments, showed that the simulated microgravity treatment (sim-µg) (mean difference = 0.33,p< 0.001) had a significantly lower RGR (Fig.6) compared to the control treatment (1 g) (mean difference = 0.38 ± 0.02). The simulated Moon partial gravity treatment (sim-Moon g) also exhibited a lower RGR than the control treatment, but the difference was not statistically significant (mean difference = 0.36,p= 0.25). Observed RGR across the different treatments. Graph shows the relative growth rate (RGR) resulting from the different gravities levels. Data refer to means ± SD of the means (N = 12). The letters on top of the bars describes the homogenous subsets calculated with the Tukey's post-hoc analysis. In contrast, hypergravity treatments (2 g and 4 g) showed higher RGR compared to the control treatment. However, there was no significant difference between the control and 2 g hypergravity treatments (mean difference = 0. 38,p= 0.99). The 4 g hypergravity treatment (4 g) showed the highest RGR among all treatments, however the difference was not statistically significant compared to the control treatment (mean difference = 0.39,p< 0.50). Furthermore, the doubling time is reported. The sim-µg treatment exhibited the longest doubling time of 2.18 days, followed by the sim-Moon g, 1 g, 2 g, and 4 g treatments with doubling times of 1.99, 1.83, 1.82, and 1.82 days, respectively (Fig.7).

In the realm of plant cultivation for space exploration (on orbital platforms, the Moon, and Mars), a more profound comprehension of plant reactions to altered gravitational conditions is essential16. Previous studies have shown various effects of microgravity on the growth of several plant species, but research on the effects of partial gravity and hypergravity on plants has been limited15,18. The aid of facilities such as RPMs and LDC can be the perfect testing ground before experimenting with true microgravity18,19and testing the effect of different gravity levels on the performances of novel space crop species7. The adaptability ofWolffia globosato altered gravity conditions suggested by our data hints at the potential use of plants from the genusWolffiain space agriculture. These plants, characterised by rapid growth and high nutrient content, are strong candidates for food production in space, where resource constraints are critical7,13. Our findings further appraise the possible use ofWolffia globosafor space exploration and the establishment of sustainable agriculture in extraterrestrial environments. The robust growth and adaptability to altered gravity conditions can be added to the small size, rapid growth rate, and high nutrient content, confirming that this genus deserves consideration for cultivation in limited space and resource-constrained environments7. AlthoughWolffia globosaexhibited a reduced growth rate in our experiment under simulated microgravity, previous research has seen growth enactment ofWolffia globosaunder simulated microgravity26. As already mentioned by the authors of the up-mentioned work, the enhanced growth might be linked to better utilisation of dissolved oxygen and organic substances in the growth medium due to the type of cultivation system they have employed26. The varying responses observed among different gravity treatments in our experiment could be attributed to the interplay between genetic variability within the Lemnaceae family and the specific environmental conditions experienced by each individual plant. Notably, the genusWolffiacomprises numerous species with significant genetic diversity. Testing the effects of altered gravity on only one clone ofWolffia globosa, as done in our experiment, provides a valuable starting point but may not fully capture the entire range of responses within the genusWolffia. Further investigations involving multipleWolffiaspecies and clones are warranted to explore the full extent of the species' reaction to altered gravity and better understand the role of genetic variability in shaping their growth patterns. In addition to its implications for space agriculture, this research also contributes to our understanding of fundamental plant biology. The findings of our experiment might encourage further investigations to clarify the evolutionary pathways that shaped the peculiar adaptation to gravity associated to a return to an ancestral aquatic environment ofWolffiagenus.
