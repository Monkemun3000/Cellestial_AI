To whom correspondence should be addressed.chc2076@med.cornell.edu Bone remodeling of the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule is highly restricted and tightly controlled by the osteoprotegerin (OPG) / receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) / receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B (RANK) system. In these bony structures, a pathological decrease in OPG expression stimulates osteoclast differentiation and excessive resorption followed by accrual of sclerotic bone, ultimately resulting in the development of otosclerosis, a leading cause of deafness in adults. Understanding the signaling pathways involved in maintaining OPG expression in the ear would shed light on the pathophysiology of otosclerosis and other ear bone-related diseases. We and others previously demonstrated that Ca2+signaling through the L-type CaV1.2 Ca2+channel positively regulates OPG expression and secretion in long bone osteoblasts and their precursor cellsin vitroandin vivo.Whether CaV1.2 regulates OPG expression in ear bones has not been investigated. We drove expression of a gain-of-function CaV1.2 mutant channel (CaV1.2TS) usingCol2a1-Cre,which we found to target osteochondral/osteoblast progenitors in the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule.Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TSmice displayed osteopetrosis of these bones shown by μCT 3D reconstruction, histological analysis, and lack of bone sculpting, findings similar to phenotypes seen in mice with an osteoclast defect. Consistent with those observations, we found thatCol2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TSmutant mice showed reduced osteoclasts in the otic capsule, upregulated mRNA expression ofOpgandOpg/Ranklratio, and increased mRNA expression of osteoblast differentiation marker genes in the otic capsule, suggesting both an anti-catabolic and anabolic effect of CaV1.2TSmutant channel contributed to the observed morphological changes of the ear bones. Further, we found thatCol2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TSmice experienced hearing loss and displayed defects of body balance in behavior tests, confirming that the CaV1.2-dependent Ca2+influx affects bone structure in the ear and consequent hearing and vestibular functions. Together, these data support our hypothesis that Ca2+influx through CaV1.2TSpromotes OPG expression from osteoblasts, thereby affecting bone modeling/remodeling in the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule. These data provide insight into potential pathological mechanisms underlying perturbed OPG expression and otosclerosis. The middle ear contains the three auditory ossicles—the malleus, incus, and stapes—which sequentially conduct sound by transmitting sound vibrations from the tympanic membrane to the fluid in the cochlea via the oval window of the otic capsule, the bony case enclosing the cochlea and vestibular system. In the otic capsule, the vibrations are converted into electrical signals and transduced to the brain via auditory nerves [1]. Abnormal morphological changes of the bone structures in the auditory ossicles or the otic capsule may disturb sound transmission and cause conductive hearing loss and/or vestibular dysfunction. In humans, reduced OPG in the otic capsule is associated with otosclerosis [12,13], a condition characterized by abnormal growth of bone at one or more foci within the middle ear or inner ear that often leads to hearing loss in patients. Otosclerosis develops initially through a first phase of bone resorption by activated osteoclasts and increased vascularization (the otospongiosis phase), followed by new bone deposition from osteoblasts and mineralization (the otosclerosis phase) [13]. The prevalence of otosclerosis is high in Caucasians compared to patients of African descent and higher in women than men [14]. The etiology of otosclerosis is not well understood, but both genetic and environmental factors, including measles virus infection, hormonal changes during pregnancy and middle ear inflammation, have been postulated to contribute. Family linkage analyses and candidate gene association studies have identified several loci associated with otosclerosis, yet none of the otosclerosis causing genes within these regions has been identified so far [15–17]. Nevertheless, mutations inSERPINF1orMEPEhave been recently associated with familial otosclerosis [18,19]. Given that maintaining OPG level is fundamental to the prevention of bone turnover in the middle and inner ear and the consequent development of otosclerosis, a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulates OPG expression will provide clues regarding the underlying biological basis of the disease. In this study, we demonstrate a role for the L-type CaV1.2 voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) in the regulation of OPG expression in the middle and inner ear. The CaV1.2 channel is widely distributed and mediates Ca2+influx into the cell upon membrane depolarization. The entry of Ca2+causes a transient increase of intracellular [Ca2+]i, which serves as a second messenger and mediates critical physiological roles in many organs, including cardiac muscle contraction, hormone secretion in endocrine tissues, postsynaptic responses in various 5 neurons, and activation of gene expression paradigms [20]. However, its role in the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule was not previously reported. The CaV1.2 channel is composed of multiple subunits: α1C, β, and α2δ [21]. The α1Csubunit is the ion-conducting pore while the β and α2δ are auxiliary subunits that modulate channel properties [22]. Most studies focused on CaV1.2 function in excitable cells such as cardiomyocytes and neurons, where frequent and dynamic changes in membrane potential facilitate activation of the voltage-gated channel, with little attention to potential contributions of the channel in non-excitable cells. Studies of Timothy syndrome (TS), a multiorgan disorder caused byde novogain-of-function missense mutations in the α1C-encodingCACNA1Cgene [23,24], revealed critical but previously unappreciated roles for CaV1.2 in many non-excitable cells. We and others demonstrated that CaV1.2 was expressed in osteoblast progenitors during long bone development and homeostasis [25–27]. Moreover, in anin vitroMC3T3-E1 cell and a primary calvaria organ culture system, Ca2+signaling through CaV1.2 regulated OPG expression [28]. Pharmacological blocking of CaV1.2 channel activity with nifedipine reduced the level of OPG expression and secretion [28]. Consistent with those findings, we exploited the TS-causing mutant channel (CaV1.2TS) to increase Ca2+signaling specifically in osteoblasts or their progenitors and observed inhibited osteoclast activity in long bones through upregulated OPG expression and secretion [25]. Given its ability to modulate the OPG/RANKL/RANK pathway, we hypothesized that CaV1.2 could also affect bone modeling in the ear. Here, we show that increased Ca2+signaling through CaV1.2TSexpressed in the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule affected bone modeling/remodeling as well as auditory and vestibular function. Defining the role of Ca2+signaling through CaV1.2 in the physiological regulation of osteoclast formation offers insights into the mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of otosclerosis and other bony disorders of the ear and provides clues for future explorations of therapeutic strategies or prevention of hearing loss caused by bony structural changes in the middle and inner ear. 2.1. Experimental mouse models All animals were handled according to protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Duke University and at Weill Cornell Medical College.Rosa26-CaV1.2TSandCol2a1-Crehave been described previously [29–31]. HomozygousRosa26-CaV1.2TSfemale mice were crossed withCol2a1-Cremales to generateCol2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TSmutant progeny andCre-negative littermate controls [31] with both sexes used in all experiments. X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactopyranoside) staining was performed on whole mount specimens. The auditory ossicles, the inner ear vestibular system and cochlea were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde on ice for 1 hour, washed three times with 1 × PBS, and stained with X-gal solution (5 mM potassium ferrocyanide, 5 mM potassium ferricyanide, 1 mg/ml X-gal, 2 mM MgCI2, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.2% IGEPAL CA-630) in the dark for 12 hours at 37 °C. Specimens were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, washed three times with 1 × PBS, and then embedded in 2% agarose gel in a 50 ml centrifuge tube. Images were obtained with a Scanco VivaCT 80 scanner (Scanco Medical AG, Switzerland) set to 55 kVp and 145 μA, voxel size 10.4 μm. 2.4. Histology and TRAP staining Specimens were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, washed three times with 1 × PBS, then decalcified in 14% EDTA at 4 °C for 2 weeks. Samples were processed for paraffin embedding and then sectioned at 10 μm thickness. Alcian Blue Hematoxylin /Orange G (ABH/OG) staining and TRAP staining were performed following standard protocols. The otic capsule surrounding the cochlear part of the control andCol2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TSmutant mice at 8 weeks of age was carefully dissected, and grinded in a bath of liquid nitrogen using the disposable micro Tissue homogenizer (BioMasher, Japan). Ground samples were collected with 500 μl Trizol (Qiagen) and total RNA was purified using the ZR tissue & Insect RNA MicroPrep kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA). qPCR was performed using SYBR green Supermix (Bio-Rad). The primers forOpgandRanklandGapdhhave been described previously [25]. Gene expression was first normalized toGapdhand then normalized to control samples. 2.6. Auditory Brainstem response (ABR) test The 6-week old mice were anesthetized with ketamine (125 mg/kg) and xylazine (12.5 mg/kg) via intraperitoneal injection prior to all procedures. Once a suitable plane of anesthesia was reached, the portion of the pinna which obscured the entrance to the tested ear canal was removed. The anesthetized animal was then placed in a sound-isolated, electrically-shielded box on top of a heating pad (40-90-2-05, FHC, Inc.). In conjunction with the heating pad, a rectal probe and DC temperature controller (41-90-8D, FHC, Inc.) were used to maintain the mouse’s temperature near 38 °C. Both eyes were moistened with ophthalmic ointment (Puralube®, Dechra Veterinary Products). Needle electrodes (GRD-SAF, The Electrode Store) were subdermally placed behind the pinna of the tested ear (reference electrode), in the scalp between the ears (active electrode), and in the back near the tail (ground electrode). ABRs were evoked by tone bursts of 4, 8, 16, and 32 kHz produced by a closed-field magnetic speaker connected to a power amplifier (MF1 and SA1, Tucker-Davis Technologies). Each 5-ms burst was presented 33.3 times per second with alternating polarity. The onset and offset of each burst was tapered with a squared cosine function. For each frequency, the sound pressure level was lowered from 80 dB SPL in 5–10 dB steps until the threshold was reached. If 80 dB SPL was not enough to elicit a response, higher intensities were produced. The speaker’s output was transmitted into the ear through a custom acoustic coupler. The entire sound delivery system was calibrated with a ¼ inch condenser microphone (4939-A-011 and 2690-A-0S1, Brüel & Kjær). The electrical response evoked by the tone bursts and measured by the needle electrodes was amplified 10,000 times and bandpass filtered at 0.3–3 kHz (P55, Astro-Med Inc.). The amplified response was then digitally sampled at 10-μs intervals with a data acquisition device (PCI-6259, National Instruments) controlled by custom software (LabVIEW 2014, National Instruments). The electrical responses to 1,000 bursts were averaged at each intensity level to determine the threshold, which was defined as the lowest level at which any response peak was distinctly and reproducibly present. Visual inspection of the vertically stacked responses facilitated threshold determination. Spontaneous activity in an open field arena was monitored with Fusion Open Field Legacy system (Omnitech Electronics Inc., Columbus, OH) over 15 minutes. Mice at 6 weeks of age were singly placed in a 20 × 20 × 40 cm Plexiglas open field arena where activity was monitored by two rows of infrared diodes interfaced to a computer running Fusion 5.3 software. The activity of the animals in the open field were also recorded to digital video from a camera mounted over each test arena using Noldus Media Player (Noldus Information Technologies). The total distance (cm) moved and the circling activity as scored with Fusion software is reported. Circling is defined as the combination of clockwise and counter-clockwise circles performed by the mouse in the open field. In a separate test, balance and coordination were examined using a steady state rotarod at 25 rpm (Medd-Associates, St. Albans, VT). The steady speed was selected on a basis of an accelerated speed (4-40 rpm) given 24 hours prior to the steady speed test. This study showed that the average speed at which the mice fell from an accelerating rotarod was approximately 25 rpm. For the steady speed rotarod test, mice were given four 5-minute trials separated by a 20 min inter-trial interval (ITI). In all cases, trials terminated when the mouse fell from the rod or at 300 seconds. This time (s) was recorded as the latency to fall from the rod. All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 7.0 by two-tailed unpaired Student’sttests. Data were presented as mean ± SD or mean ±SEM from n > 3 experiments. Two-sided p values less than 0.05 were considered statically significant. qPCR analyses were performed with > 3 independent RNA isolates and triplicates for each RNA sample. Fold changes were calculated by dividing the value of the mutant mice by the value of the control mice. Increasing or decreasing percentage changes were calculated by dividing the value of difference between the treatment group and control group by the value of the control group and then multiplying 100. 3.1. Middle and inner ear appearance in Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TSmice To examine whether CaV1.2 contributes to development of the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule, we tested whether increasing Ca2+signaling specifically through Cav1.2 affected the structure of the ossicles and otic capsule. We employed aCaV1.2TStransgenic mouse model, in whichCaV1.2TSexpression was silenced by a floxed upstream stop codon. We activatedCaV1.2TSmutant channel expression in the bones of ear withCol2a1-Cre,which targets the osteochondral progenitors [31]. TargetedCol2a1-Creexpression in the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule was confirmed withCol2a1-Cre;Rosa26-lacZreporter mice (Fig. 1). TheCol2a1-CredirectedlacZexpression in the ossicles and otic capsule, detected by prominent β-galactosidase staining that was absent inRosa26-lacZreporter mice lacking theCol2a1-Cre.We then examined the morphology of the isolated auditory ossicles and the otic capsule fromCol2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TSmutant mice and theirCre-negative littermate controls at 6 weeks of age. We found that the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule ofCaV1.2TS-expressing mutant mice were thicker and had more bone mass than those of the control mice, particularly at the malleus handle, the malleus bony membrane, the incus body, the footplate of stapes, the stapedial arch (especially the anterior and posterior crura), and the whole otic capsule (Fig. 2A–D). InCol2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TSmutant mice, narrowed spaces were observed between the stapedial crura (through which the stapedial artery passes), for the round window and the oval window of the otic capsule. μCT 3-D reconstruction images of the auditory ossicles and the otic capsules confirmed the thicken bones and massive increase of bone mass in the malleus, incus, stapes and the otic capsules of theCol2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TSmutant mice as well as the narrowed cavities for the stapedial artery and the cochlea (Fig. 2E–H).

E-H, μCT 3-D reconstruction of the auditory ossicles, vestibular system and cochlea ofCre-negative littermate controls (E and F) andCol2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TSmice (G and H) at 6 weeks of age. Histological examination and staining with Alcian Blue Hematoxylin/Orange G (ABH/OG) of the otic capsule showed that inCol2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TSmutant mice the original bone marrow region was occupied with excessive bone, while the organ of corti was largely intact (Fig. 3A–F). We also observed extensive Alcian Blue-stained cartilage remnant in the bones of the mutant mice besides the Alcian Blue-stained cartilage remnant of the globuli interossei in the cochlea, suggesting osteoclast defects in the mutant mice. Moreover, the mutant otic capsules lacked sculpting, further indicative of defective osteoclast function. Fig. 3. Histological analysis of the inner ear of theCol2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TSmice. A-F, Alcian Blue Hematoxylin/Orange G (ABH/OG) staining of sagittal sections from the inner ear ofCre-negative littermate controls (A, with higher magnification in B and C) andCol2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TSmice (D, with higher magnification E and F) at 4 weeks of age, showing excessive bone mass in the vestibular system and cochlea but with little changes in the organ of corti ofCol2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TSmice. G-J, ABH/OG staining of the stapedio-vestibular junction ofCre-negative controls (G, with higher magnification in H) andCol2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TSmice (I, with higher magnification in J) at 4 weeks of age, showing the stapes footplate was not fixed but increased bone volume of stapes footplate and vestibule likely limited its movement inCol2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TSmice. We histologically examined the stapedio-vestibular joint space in theCol2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TSmutant and control mice and found that it was not fixed in the CaV1.2TS-expressing mutant mice (Fig. 3G–J). However, the enlarged bone volume in the stapes footplate and the otic capsule likely limited the stapes movement. Because the histology indicated defective osteoclast function in the mutant mice, we analyzed the effect of increased Ca2+signaling through CaV1.2TSon osteoclasts. We performed tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining on histological sections of the otic capsulesCol2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TSmutant mice and littermate controls at 2 weeks of age. Compared to the controls, we observed significantly less TRAP-staining and fewer osteoclasts in the otic capsule ofCol2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TSmutant mice (Fig. 4A–F). We next quantitated the number of TRAP-positive multinucleated osteoclasts and osteoclast area, both of which were normalized to the bone area. The number of osteoclasts per bone area (Oc.N/B.Ar) was decreased by 91% and osteoclast area per bone area (Oc.Ar/B/Ar) decreased by 79% inCol2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TSmice (Fig. 4G), suggesting that osteoblastic bone resorption of the otic capsule is greatly reduced inCol2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TSmice during postnatal development. AsCol2a1-Creexpression is restricted to osteochondral lineage but not to osteoclast progenitors, increased Ca2+signaling through CaV1.2TSmutant channel could inhibit osteoclastogenesis via interfering with the OPG/RANKL/RANK pathway in the otic capsule, similar to that we observed in the long bone [25]. We therefore examinedOpgandRanklmRNA expression in the otic capsule surrounding the cochlea ofCol2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TSmutant mice and their littermate controls. Indeed, RT-qPCR analysis revealed upregulated (~4.4 fold)OpgmRNA expression in the otic capsule ofCol2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TSmutant mice compared with that in the control mice but no significant change inRanklmRNA expression, thus resulting in an increase (~2.6 fold) inOpg/RanklmRNA expression ratio in the otic capsule (Fig. 4H). We also detected upregulated mRNA expression of genes for osteoblast differentiation, such asAlpl, Runx2andSp7in the otic capsule ofCol2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TSmutant mice (Fig. 4I), suggesting an anabolic effect of CaV1.2TSalso contributed the increased bone mass in the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule ofCol2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TSmutant mice.

Col2a 1-Cre;CaV1.2TSmice are hearing impaired To assess whether the morphological changes in the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule in theCol2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TSmutant mice impaired auditory function, we tested the auditory brainstem response (ABR) in bothCol2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TSmutant mice and their littermate controls at 6 weeks of age. Representative responses from control (Fig. 5A) andCaV1.2TS-expressing mutant mice (Fig. 5B) to decreasing stimulus intensities at 8 kHz showed differences in sensitivity and latency between the two genotypes. Compared to the control mice, theCol2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TSmutant mice had no response to intensities below 85 dB SPL at 8 kHz and below 75 dB at 16 kHz (Fig. 5Cand5D). The mutant mice also showed delays for even stronger stimulus intensities (Fig. 5Cand5D). Furthermore, the hearing threshold of theCol2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TSmutant mice was significantly higher (lower sensitivity) than that of the control mice in the 4 to 16 kHz region, while we found no significant difference in threshold between two genotypes at 32 kHz (Fig. 5E). That the hearing loss inCol2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TSmutant mice is spared only in the high-frequency range is consistent with a conductive hearing loss mechanism, in which sounds fail to be transferred via the ossicular chain in the middle ear to the cochlea.

Col2a1Cre;CaV1.2TSmice show impaired vestibular function Fig. 6. Deficits of body balance inCol2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TSmice. Our data demonstrate that Ca2+influx through CaV1.2 regulates development of the auditory ossicles and otic capsule. Moreover, excessive Ca2+influx through TS-causing mutant CaV1.2 channel causes deficits in both hearing and body balance. The abnormal bone growth of the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule inCol2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TSmice is likely due to both increased bone formation and decreased bone resorption, similar to the dual effect of the CaV1.2TSmutant channel on long bones that we previously demonstrated [25]. Although osteoclastogenesis is normally suppressed in the ossicles and the auditory otic capsule because of a locally high level of OPG, osteoclast function is still required to sculpt these bones during development. Absence of osteoclastic bone resorption inRankl−/−,Fos−/−andCsf1op/opmice significantly affected these bones morphologically and functionally [4]. Expression of the gain-of-function CaV1.2TSmutant channel in ourCol2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TSmice affected the overall morphology of the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule, which display reduced sculpting (see the stapedial crura) and an osteopetrotic phenotype that are strikingly similar to those seen inRankl−/−,Fos−/−andCsf1op/oposteoclastic defect mice [4], suggesting that the anticatabolic effect of increased Ca2+signaling through CaV1.2TScontributed to the morphological changes in theses bones. While this is the first demonstration, to our knowledge, showing that modulating Ca2+signal via CaV1.2 in the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule regulates osteoclastogenesis and bone modeling/remodeling in the middle and inner ear, our data are consistent with previous observations from others and us that CaV1.2 regulates OPG expression and secretion from osteoblasts [25,28]. That expression of theCaV1.2TSmutant channel in our model was driven byCol2a1-Cre,which restricts expression to chondrocytes and osteoblast precursors but not in osteoclasts or their progenitors [31], adds further support to our hypothesis that the anticatabolic responses by altered CaV1.2 activity is mediated by upregulated OPG expression and secretion in bones of the ear. Our data showing increasedOpgmRNA expression in the otic capsule surrounding the cochlea inCol2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TSmice further supports this hypothesis. Moreover, since theCaV1.2TStransgene expression is driven byCol2a1-Cre,the hearing and vestibular defects we observed can be attributed to the abnormal bone, and not to mutant channel expression in the hair cells of the cochlea and vestibular system or downstream nerves, in whichCol2a1-Creis not active. Consistent with that hypothesis, the organ of Corti is grossly intact inCol2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TSmice (Fig. 4). However, as aberrant bone remodeling progresses inCol2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TSmice, it is also possible that the increased bone formation of the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule and narrowed cavities in the bony labyrinth of the otic capsule could impair neuronal function and contribute to the circling behavior and hearing impairment. Thus, eventually both bone structure and neuronal dysfunction may contribute to the observed defects in hearing and vestibular function. The voltage-gated CaV1.2 Ca2+ channel regulates (re)modeling of ear auditory ossicles and otic capsule. Perturbed CaV1.2 function affects OPG levels and consequent osteoclastic activity in ear bones. These data identify a potential role for Ca2+signaling through CaV1.2 in otosclerosis. We thank for Dr. A.
