Root hairs are single-cell cylindrical projections that expand the effective radius of the root. In doing so, they play crucial roles in the uptake of water and nutrients from the soil, especially under conditions in which such resources are limiting (Carminati et al., 2017). Root hairs expand by tip growth, a process that involves the targeted delivery and secretion of vesicles to the cell apex. As a result, root hairs attain lengths that are several times their widths (Chebli et al., 2013). In tip-growing cells, cargo transported by tip-targeted vesicles consist of an assortment of carbohydrate precursors that are needed for the assembly and remodeling of the apical cell wall (Gu and Nielsen, 2013). Research spanning several decades has led to the identification of multiple components of the tip growth machinery including protein modulators of cytoskeletal organization, membrane trafficking, cytoplasmic calcium ([Ca2+]cyt) signaling, and phosphoinositide metabolism (Cole and Fowler, 2006;Rounds and Bezanilla, 2013). In recent years, plant malectin-like receptor kinases, also known asCatharanthus roseusreceptor-like kinases (CrRLK1Ls;Franck et al., 2018), have been shown to regulate tip growth in root hairs and pollen tubes (Duan et al., 2010;Bai et al., 2014;Haruta et al., 2014;Ge et al., 2017;Schoenaers et al., 2018). In one noteworthy study,Bai et al. (2014)reported that a CrRLK1L, which they named [Ca2+]cyt-associated protein kinase 1 (CAP1), modulates root hair growth by maintaining ammonium (NH4+) homeostasis. CAP1 is also known as ERULUS (ERU), named after the son of FERONIA (FER), a widely studied member of the CrRLK1L family (Haruta et al., 2014). InArabidopsis thaliana,cap1/eruloss-of-function mutants have short and irregularly shaped root hairs consistent with a role of CAP1/ERU as a positive regulator of root hair growth (Bai et al., 2014;Haruta et al., 2014;Schoenaers et al., 2018).Bai et al. (2014)proposed a model wherein CAP1/ERU functions in maintaining root hair growth under high NH4+environments by sensing cytoplasmic NH4+. Sensing of cytoplasmic NH4+by CAP1/ERU then triggers signaling events that lead to NH4+sequestration into the vacuole, making it less toxic to the cell. The model postulates that toxic levels of NH4+accumulate in the cytoplasm ofcap1/eruloss-of-function mutants, resulting in the disappearance of tip-focused [Ca2+]cytgradients, and because of this lack of tip-focused [Ca2+]cytgradients, their root hairs cease to expand (Bai et al., 2014). In this letter, we question the proposed role of CAP1/ERU in NH4+homeostasis based on our studies of a neweru-3mutant allele, showing that CAP1/ERU is instead localized to the plasma membrane (PM) and its function is linked to tip-focused [Ca2+]cytoscillations. This is further supported by recent work on theeru-2mutant bySchoenaers et al. (2018), as described below. CAP1/ERU IS A PM-LOCALIZED PROTEIN A major result used to support the CAP1/ERU-NH4+homeostasis model was the observation that a CAP1/ERU-GFP fusion localized to the tonoplast. According to the model, the tonoplast-localized CAP1/ERU is what senses cytoplasmic NH4+, resulting in its compartmentalization into the vacuole (Bai et al., 2014). A Functional ERU-GFP Fusion Localizes to the PM and Post-Golgi/Endocytic Vesicles at the Root Hair Tip. (A)Schematic diagram of the domain organization of the ERU protein.

(E)Doubleyaxis graph showing that fluorescence of ERU-GFP intensifies as root hairs transition to rapid tip growth. Relative fluorescence and root hair length were measured every 10 min. Mean ±se(n= 4 root hairs from four independent 4-d-old seedlings). It is important to note thatBai et al. (2014)used transient expression of a CAP1/ERU-GFP fusion in protoplasts and onion epidermal cells to conclude that it localized to the tonoplast, and the functionality of their CAP1/ERU-GFP construct was not validated in root hairs. It is possible that their CAP1/ERU-GFP was mislocalized because it was expressed in cell types (i.e., leaf protoplasts and onion epidermal cells) in which ERU is not typically found. We attempted to express ERU-GFP in theeru-3mutant under the control of the nativeERUpromoter (ERUpro) consisting of 626 bp upstream of theERUgene. Unfortunately, we were unable to recoverERUpro:ERU-GFPlines. However, it was recently reported that a 2529-bp sequence that included theERUpromoter coupled to theERUcoding andGFPsequence (ERUp:ERU-GFP) complementedcap1/eru-2root hairs (Schoenaers et al., 2018). This group found that expressed ERU-GFP localized to root hairs in a similar manner as our constitutively expressed ERU-GFP, further supporting our conclusion that the PM is where the ERU protein resides.
