Suborbital spaceflights now enable human-tended research investigating short-term gravitational effects in biological systems, eliminating the need for complex automation. Here, we discuss a method utilizing KSC Fixation Tubes (KFTs) to both carry biology to suborbital space as well as fix that biology at certain stages of flight. Plants on support media were inserted into the sample side of KFTs preloaded with RNAlater in the fixation chamber. The KFTs were activated at various stages of a simulated flight to fix the plants. RNA-seq analysis conducted on tissue samples housed in KFTs, showed that plants behaved consistently in KFTs when compared to petri-plates. Over the time course, roots adjusted to hypoxia and leaves adjusted to changes in photosynthesis. These responses were due in part to the environment imposed by the encased triple containment of the KFTs, which is a requirement for flight in human spacecraft. While plants exhibited expected reproducible transcriptomic alteration over time in the KFTs, responses to clinorotation during the simulated flight suggest that transcriptomic responses to suborbital spaceflight can be examined using this approach. The commercial suborbital spaceflight industry enables customers to reach the cusp of space and experience microgravity for several minutes before returning to Earth. The two main companies at the forefront of suborbital space efforts are Blue Origin (BO) and Virgin Galactic (VG). The two companies use different vehicles for their suborbital launches. Blue Origin flies New Shepard, a vertical rocket with a Crew Capsule. Virgin Galactic flies SpaceShipTwo, a rocket plane that is carried to high altitude before being dropped for launch. As such, the two providers present different modes of operations, different customer experiences and different flight profiles. Common features of both suborbital providers are a high g launch, minutes of microgravity conditions, followed by a high g re-entry. Although, the providers have different flight and gravity profiles, they both enable approximately three minutes of unmitigated microgravity [1,2]. It is those minutes of microgravity that are of high interest to science. From a biological researcher’s perspective, three minutes of high-quality microgravity opens the possibility to conduct a myriad of experiments—including but not limited to testing hardware capability, validating hypothesis, and understanding biological responses of not only microgravity, but the entirety of the spaceflight profile. Even though providers currently offer researchers an opportunity to send payloads on suborbital flight, there are severe limitations in that the untended experiment payloads are required to be contained in a locker, under fully autonomously controlled without the ability of the scientist to monitor and adjust for unforeseen situations. Thus, human suborbital spaceflight provides a promising complementary opportunity for researchers to conduct human-tended microgravity-related experiments using human capabilities that can better recapitulate a laboratory bench experiment than can an automated locker payload. Sampling biological responses at various phases of flight for subsequent analysis would be a natural initial experiment to understand biology responses to suborbital space. Plants being sessile in nature have evolved mechanisms to rapidly respond to their environment. Early transcriptomic responses have been investigated in response to various stresses such as; oxidative stress, heat stress, pathogen attack, and water stress [3,4,5,6,7,8,9]. Suborbital flights allow for the investigation of how plants quickly respond to transitions in varying gravity forces. To conduct such an experiment, there are several parameters that need to be considered. The rapid transitions into and out of microgravity occur within minutes, thus there is limited time for sample preparations and fixation. Plants should be poised and ready in a medium that confers as little confounding stresses as possible and upon exposure to the changes in gravity, and then be easily and rapidly preserved for proper biochemical analysis. Samples and fixatives should be triple contained and compact in size so that the hardware can be easily stowed during the flight. In addition, the acts of human tended fixation of the samples should be able to be completed rapidly. This paper describes a ground-based experiment setup that was developed to meet the needs for conducting a human tended plant biology experiments in a suborbital flight. This method highlights the expanded use of KSC Fixation Tubes as both houses for biology and for the subsequent fixation of that biology. The paper also discusses best practices for both experiment setup and conducting a RNAseq analysis to reliably report on the transcriptome of plant samples at various stages of a suborbital flight profile. Wet-sterilized Columbia-0 (Col-0) seeds were planted aseptically on the surface of 10 cm2solid media plates comprised of the coupon inlaid with 1% Phytagel/0.5× MS media. Plants were grown under a broad-spectrum LED light bank (100 µmoles/m2) for approximately 24-h the first three days. On day 3, plates were moved to dark storage (to simulate travel to launch locations) where they spent 8 h, before being transferred to a growth unit (Danby #DFG17A1B, Montreal, QC, Canada) which is used at remote locations for plant growth. The Danby provided 24 h of approximately 80 µmoles/m2of light for another 4 days. 2.2. Plant Dissection and RNA Extraction From each condition, two individual plants were pooled for RNA extraction and a total of three biological replicates were obtained from two coupons in each KFT. Leaves, hypocotyls, and roots from each set were dissected under an Olympus dissecting microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) for downstream applications, whereas the intervening hypocotyls were set aside. RNA extraction was performed using Qiagen RNeasy Plant mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany catalog #74904) according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. RNA concentration was determined on Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA). 2.3. RNA-Sequencing Library Preparation First, 100 ng of total RNA was used for mRNA isolated using the NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA, catalog #E7490). Then, followed by RNA library construction with the NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs, catalog #E7760) with 2/3 of poly A enriched RNA and 1/10 reaction volume using SPT Labtech mosquito LV liquid handling instrument. Briefly, RNA was fragmented in NEBNext First Strand Synthesis Buffer via incubation at 94 °C for the desired time. This step was followed by first-strand cDNA synthesis using reverse transcriptase and random hexamer primer. Synthesis of ds-cDNA was performed using the 2nd strand master mix provided in the kit, followed by end-repair and adaptor ligation. At this point, Illumina adaptors were ligated to the sample. Finally, each library (uniquely barcoded) was enriched by 15 cycles of amplification, and purified with Agencourt AMPure beads (Beckman Coulter, catalog #A63881). Barcoded libraries were sized on the Bioanalyzer and quantified with the Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer. Finally, these individual libraries were pooled in equimolar concentration for sequencing aiming for 60 million reads per sample with total of 1 lane of NovaSeq S4 2 × 150 cycles run. RNASeq libraries were constructed at the UF ICBR Gene Expression Core (https://biotech.ufl.edu/gene-expression-genotyping/, accessed on 11 November 2022. RRID:SCR_019145). The Illumina NovaSeq 6000 was used to sequence the libraries for 2 × 150 cycles. Sequencing was performed at the ICBR NextGen Sequencing (https://biotech.ufl.edu/next-gen-dna/, assessed on 11 November 2022. RRID:SCR_019152). 2.4. Illumina NovaSeq6000 Sequencing Normalized libraries were submitted to the “Free Adapter Blocking Reagent” protocol (FAB, Cat# 20024145) in order to minimize the presence of adaptor-dimers and index hopping rates. The library pool was diluted to 0.8 nM and sequenced on one S4 flow cell lane (2 × 150 cycles) of the Illumina NovaSeq6000. The instrument’s computer utilized the NovaSeq Control Software v1.6. Cluster and SBS consumables were v1.5. The final loading concentration of the library was 120 pM with 1% PhiX spike-in control. One lane generated 2.5–3 billion paired-end reads (~950 Gb) with an average Q30% ≥ 92.5% and Cluster PF = 85.4%. FastQ files were generated using the BCL2fastQ function in the Illumina BaseSpace portal. 2.5. Bioinformatics Pipeline and Gene Ontology Analysis 3.1. Optimizing Plant Growth Conditions within the KFT Preparation of Arabidopsis plant coupons within the KFTs for human-tended suborbital spaceflight. (a) Illustration of the various steps in making the plant coupons. Wire mesh coupons were encased in the solidified phytagel media (i) front (ii) back. (iii) schematic of the coupon layout. (iv) Image of the plants growing on coupons inlaid in phytagel matrix. (v) Cut out of the coupons placed together back-to-back for insertion into KFTs. (b) Placement of coupons into KFTs. (i) Shows coupons inserted into the sample area of the KFTs. (ii) Image of pre-actuated KFT. (iii) Image of actuated KFT with samples fixed in RNAlater. The general application has been that the astronaut would remove a biological sample from its growth container and transfer the biology to the KFT sample tube. Once the sample was in the KFT, the KFT was sealed, and the fixative was brought into contact with the sample by activating the KFT mechanism [15]. However, for use in the short timeframes of suborbital flights, the KFTs need to be sealed before flight. This requirement necessitates that the biology be installed into the KFTs as part of a preflight procedure, and the KFT therefore becomes a biology incubator before it is activated to fix the sample. This allows the KFT to serve its purpose of containment safety for the entirety of the suborbital flight. Many previous plant molecular biology spaceflight-related experiments utilized Petri dishes containing a matrix nutrient gel to grow plants on the ISS in a variety of plant growth hardware systems (i.e., BRIC, Biological Research in Canister; ABRS, Advanced Biological Research System; EMCS, European Modular Cultivation System; Veggie). Typically, these plates are taped closed with a porous surgical Micropore®3M™ tape, that allows for gas exchange, allowing plants to grow in this configuration for up to fourteen days. Setup of KFTs for simulated suborbital spaceflight profile. (a) Image of KFTs loaded with coupons and actuated after the respective timepoints. (b) Four time points of quiescent (Q1–Q4) and one set of treatment on clinostat (C) from Q2 to Q3, seedlings were harvested. Another set of four KFTs were used for comparison with a Petri dish control at Q1. The tissues were fixed in RNAlater overnight and then dissected to roots and leaves, which were subjected to RNA-seq analysis. (c) Image of KFT mounted on a 2-D Clinostat. Samples at Q1 (T-10 min, 3 h 50 min after sealing in the KFTs) were actuated and fixed 10 min before the mock launch timepoint (T+0). Additionally, at the T-10 min timepoint, an additional set of four KFTs (Q1A, Q1B, Q1C and Q1D) were actuated to assess the variability and reproducibility of the plant transcriptome simply from being housed for that amount of time in the KFTs. To understand how this methodology differs from the standard Petri dish configuration typically used in spaceflight experiments, the plant transcriptome obtained from each of the four Q1 KFTs (Q1A-D) were compared to the transcriptome from a Petri dish control at the same T-10 min timepoint. KFTs were actuated, filling the sample compartment with RNAlater. Plants were allowed to imbibe in RNAlater at room temperature for 24 h. After fixation, seedlings were harvested at each timepoint and each KFT, with the plants on the two coupons within each KFT divided into three biological replicates. For each sample, roots and leaves were subjected to RNA-seq analysis. 3.2. KFT Provides a Suitable Microenvironment for Short-Term Plant Growth DEGs of KFT (Q1A-D) vs. plate control (Q1P) in roots at Q1. (a) Number of DEGs in four comparisons. (b) Overlap between DEGs detected in each comparison. (c) Heatmap showing expression patterns of 359 DEGs detected in at least one comparison. GO terms of biological processes for upregulated and downregulated genes are shown. Hierarchical clustering of heatmap was done using one minus cosine similarity. Genes with no expression detected in RNA-seq are indicated in gray. Number of DEGs in the pairwise comparison of four KFTs in roots. To be compliant with the triple containment criteria for operation of liquids in a suborbital flight, the KFTs must be sealed, and it is expected that plants placed within the KFTs will not have gas exchange. Therefore, an upregulation of ethylene is probable when compared to plants grown on the Q1P Petri plate. In the 115 downregulated DEGs, GO enrichment showed that cellular responses associated with nutrient starvation were repressed. These physiological responses, particularly ethylene accumulation, are commonly observed for plants grown in hardware used during spaceflight [19]. These data suggest that when compared to the typical Petri dish growth for flight experiments, the KFTs can serve as a containment vessel that allows plants to stay healthy over a several-hour duration as researchers prepare for a suborbital flight. There were gene expression differences in the plants living in the KFTs compared to those living on Petri plates, but that is expected and confirmed by these data. 3.3. Plant Responses to KFTs over Time in a Simulated Suborbital Flight Profile DEGs detected in at least one comparison of Q2, Q3 or Q4 vs. Q1 in roots. (a) Number of DEGs in three comparisons.

Hierarchical clustering of heatmap was done using one minus cosine similarity. Genes with no expression detected in RNA-seq are indicated in gray. 3.4. Short-Term Responses of Plants to Gravity Alteration in the KFT To test whether the KFT setup can capture the plant responses to gravity changes with the appropriate controls, the transcriptome of plants grown in the KFTs, placed on the clinostat (C) from the T+0 to the T+8 min timepoint, were compared to a series of different controls. The controls used were: Q1 (T-10 min), Q3 (T+8 min) that has the exact duration of time within the KFTs as (C). Due to the nature of spaceflight experiments, especially in the current early stages of operational developments, such well-timed coordination may not always be feasible. Therefore, the Clinostat (C) sample was also compared to a pooled control of Q1 and Q3, and a combined control of Q1, Q2 and Q3. DEGs of clinostat treatment (C) compared with four different controls in roots. (a) Heatmap showing significant expression patterns of 369 DEGs detected in at least one comparison. Genes with −1 < Log2FC < 1, or Padj > 0.05, or no expression data detected in RNA-seq, are filled using gray. GO terms are shown for 238 significantly induced genes that are only detected using Q1. (b) Overlap between DEGs detected in each comparison. (c) Heatmap showing full expression patterns of 369 DEGs detected in at least one comparison. The order of genes is the same as (a). Genes with no expression detected in RNA-seq are indicated in gray. DEGs of clinostat treatment (C) compared with four different controls in leaves. (a) Heatmap showing significant expression patterns of 238 DEGs detected in at least one comparison. Genes with −1 < Log2FC < 1, or Padj > 0.05, or no expression data detected in RNA-seq, are filled using gray. GO terms are shown for two clusters of genes. (b) Overlap between DEGs detected in each comparison. (c) Heatmap showing full expression patterns of 238 DEGs detected in at least one comparison. The order of genes is the same as (a). Genes with no expression detected in RNA-seq are indicated in gray. Taken together, when obtaining a well-coordinated control is not feasible, pooling controls from multiple time points can still successfully assay short-term spaceflight responses in plants. Pooled controls similarly reveal gene expression trends and eliminate other confounding responses as do the well-coordinated control, especially in roots which are known to be more sensitive to gas exchange alteration [24,25]. It is expected that the suborbital flight would encounter hyper-g profiles and vibrations that could impact the plant’s transcriptional response. Previously conducted suborbital flight experiments, using 7–12 day old plants grown on the same gel matrix described in this manuscript, have shown that plants adhere well to the gel matrix during the entire flight profile without sustaining any damages [26]. Thus, although clinorotation of the KFT has its limitations in simulating a suborbital flight, it does allow a glimpse of how researchers would still be able to capture gravity-associated responses using this method. The increased accessibility of space is crucial for the advancement of science and technology that will enable humanity to meet the goals of living on the moon and Mars. Suborbital flights now allow civilian passengers to travel to space and back, presenting a unique opportunity for scientists to perform human-tended research. The intent of this investigation is to develop a method that will enable scientists to perform hands-on plant molecular biology experiments efficiently in the suborbital environment, thereby broadening the platforms from which investigators can conduct space-related experiments. KFTs have been used to fix samples in orbital space in a wider variety of biological systems for a decade or so, but have never been used as a vessel to house samples to space. The data presented herein suggest that KFTs can be readily adapted for carrying biological samples to space in a safely contained fashion. In addition, these data suggest that the changes in plant biology that do occur upon sealing within the KFTs are manageable within the flight timelines and experiment profile, provided that comprehensive ground controls are enacted. Plants grown in the thoroughly enclosed KFTs can maintain consistent plant health for several hours, thus, providing ample time to prepare and conduct a human-tended experiment onboard the suborbital flight. Moreover, plants within KFTs exhibited robust changes in gene expression when clinorotated during the simulated microgravity portion of a suborbital flight, suggesting the potential for capturing transcriptomic responses to the actual high g and microgravity portions of a suborbital flight. This method of prepping biology to be housed in KFTs and then using KFTs for suborbital flight experiments should provide a tractable initialization of hands-on research in suborbital space.
