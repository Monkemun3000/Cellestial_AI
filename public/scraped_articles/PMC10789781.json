  "content": "Chromosomal positioning and epigenetic architecture influence DNA methylation patterns triggered by galactic cosmic radiation Received 2023 Sep 27; Accepted 2024 Jan 9; Collection date 2024. Subject terms:Computational biology and bioinformatics, Molecular biology, Space physics With a growing interest in space travel1, it is pivotal to better understand how galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) impacts human health and how its detrimental effect can be minimized2. Ionizing radiation damages DNA structure by inducing double-stranded breaks, single-stranded breaks, base damage and changing epigenetic phenotype with emphasis on DNA methylation patterns3,4. During long exposure, these alterations are likely to increase the risk of cancer and degenerative diseases occurrence5. Besides hydrogen and helium, GCR consists of heavier atomic nuclei with high linear energy transfer (high-LET) values which are of great danger for human health. Recently, Kennedy et al.6investigated an effect of high-LET56Fe,28Si ions on DNA methylation patterns in comparison to low-LET X-ray appearing in terrestrial radiation. The researchers found that the methylation status of56Fe irradiated CpG sites can distinguish normal tissue from lung adenocarcinomas and squamous cell lung carcinomas. Additionally, the researchers showed acute radiation-induced methylation changes which persisted over time with heritable imprint across epigenome. These findings where further investigated by Nwanaji-Enwerem et al.7showing that56Fe exposure was associated with accelerations in epiTOC2 epigenetic clock suggesting that DNA methylation may be a sensitive biomarker of high-LET56Fe ion exposure. Chromatin packages the eukaryotic genome through DNA folding ranging from single nucleosome to entire chromosome8. Negatively charged DNA is wrapped around nucleosomes consisting of two copies of four positively charged histone proteins9. In addition to the core chromatin components, histone-modifying enzymes may alter chromatin compaction by changing its accessibility. The accessibility level is connected with chromatin modifications. In particular, H3 lysine 4 tri-methylation (H3K4me3) and histone H3 lysine 27 tri-methylation (H3K27me3) were used to profile ‘active’ and ‘repressed’ promoters respectively. Furthermore, histone H3 lysine 9 tri-methylation (H3K9me3) was used to profile heterochromatin loci and histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) to profile enhancers10. For the purpose of our work, we used Hi-C data to create detailed nuclear division introducing five distinct radial nuclear layers. Additionally, we characterized each layer separately using various of epigenetic and transcriptomic features. Specifically, we explored an effect of high-LET and low-LET ions on methylation DNA patterns in human lung epithelial cells using a previously published dataset of Kennedy et al.6. Further, we tried to understand how the radiation penetrates cell nucleus and influences methylation levels in distinct layers of nucleus, as well as how spatial chromosomal conformation and epigenetic architecture influence DNA alterations triggered by external radiation. To achieve this, we used existing publicly availablein-vitroandin-vivodata and performed the following analyses: (1) Hi-C analysis to check how three-dimensional structure of cell nucleus impacts response to irradiation. Additionally, we divided cell nucleus into five laterally distributed layers to identify potential irradiation effects associated with peripheral and internal positioning of chromatin and other epigenetic features; (2) chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data to assess the impact of distinct histone modifications on DNA methylation changes and (3) microarrays, and RNA-seq data to assess the impact of gene expression on irradiation response. This research addresses the pressing need to understand the impact of galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) on human health, driven by the increasing interest in space travel. Our study builds on existing knowledge, investigating the influence of DNA structure on radiation outcomes. We used the concept of radial nuclear layers to explore how chromatin properties, including histone modifications and spatial conformation, affect DNA methylation alterations induced by low- and high-LET ions. Leveraging recent technological advances, such as high-throughput capture chromatin confirmation, we created a nuanced nuclear division with five nonoverlapping nuclear layers to better understand the spatial distribution of chromatin and its features, as well as its impact on radiation response. Our multiomics approach integrates Hi-C, ChIP-seq, and microarray/RNA-seq data, providing insights into the complex interplay between chromatin architecture, epigenetic modifications, gene expression and the cellular response to GCR. This research aims to contribute valuable information for developing strategies to minimize the adverse effects of cosmic radiation during space travel.

(D) DNA methylation change versus control among common DMPs for Si 1 Gy and X ray particles from FeSi 1 Gy and FeX 1 Gy comparisons. (E,F) The overlay of DMPs which methylation level changed ( ≥ 0.58) versus control between particles. X axis—grouping of individual and overlayed DMPs; Y axis—number of DMPs in each group. (G) Genic location of DMPs located inside or outside differentially methylated regions (DMRs) (H,I) Relation of DMPs and primary probes to CpG islands. Shores are up to 2 kb from the CpG island; Shelves are from 2 to 4 kb from the CpG island; Opensea refers to isolated regions that do not have a specific designation. For the purpose of the analysis, we combined shores and shelves regions. Differential methylation analysis To investigate the overall influence of each radiation type on methylation DNA patterns we established three pair comparisons between 1)56Fe 0.3 Gy versus28Si 0.3 Gy; 2)56Fe 1 Gy versus28Si 1 Gy; 3)56Fe 1 Gy versus X 1 Gy. Before the analysis, we transformed provided in the original publication Beta Values (ratio of the methylated probe intensity and the overall intensity) into M Values (log2 ratio of the intensities of methylated probe versus unmethylated probe)17. Afterwards, we performed a differential methylation analysis of 485,061 probes for established comparisons using dmpFinder from Minfi Bioconductor package18. Differentially methylated probes (DMPs) were filtered based on the q-value (q < 0.05) and the absolute average difference in M Value between compared samples (absolute average difference ≥ 0.58). Additionally, we applied a threshold of M Value change versus control (absolute average difference ≥ 0.58)17. Filtered DMPs were grouped into differentially methylated regions (DMRs) using dmrcate (lambda = 1000, C = 2) from DMRcate Bioconductor package19. The average methylation level for each DMR was calculated by overlapping filtered and ion specific DMPs. Due to the fact that culturing, irradiation, collection time (48-h) and DNA methylation levels were the same for all non-irradiated replicates, control DNA methylation levels were defined as average M Value of combined56Fe,28Si, X-ray non-irradiated samples (Fig.S1A). All analysis were performed in R Studio20. Mann–Kendall test was used for trend analysis with at least 4 data points. Chi-squared test was used to check differences between examined groups. Chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) To validate the in vitro model, we used processed RNA-sequencing (Series OD-203, OSD-294, OSD-530) and microarray (Series OSD-80, OSD-109, OSD-117, OSD-159) gene expression data of whole-body irradiated (no direct information provided for OSD-294 and OSD-80) mice and JAXA astronauts provided with courtesy by the NASA GeneLab Data Repository (https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/projects/). Specifically, a variety of mice tissues irradiated with distinct particles were examined including liver (56Fe 0.2 Gy)30, retina (57Co 0.04 Gy)31, heart (56Fe 0.15 Gy;1H 0.9 Gy)32, mammary gland (Si 0.3 Gy, sparsely ionizing gamma rays 1 Gy)33and blood (137Cs 2.7 Gy)34. Additionally, we examined blood samples of six JAXA astronauts21. Due to the astronauts’ data provided only by mean expression values of all astronauts, there was only one replicate per distinct timepoint. Hence, to perform differential expression analysis, we established five distinct timepoints using two following timepoints as replicates [1) Control—L-112/56(± 14d) day – pre-flight; 2) L + 5(± 1d) day, and L + 30(± 7d) day—in-flight; 3) L + 60/120(± 14d) day or R-8(-14d/ + 0d) day—in-flight; 4) R + 3(± 1d) day, and R + 30(± 7d) day—post-flight; 5) R + 60/120(± 14d) day—post-flight; L-launch; R-rescue]. To establish research models for differential expression analysis, we built the EdgeR object using limma package35. We normalized RNA-sequencing data using weighted trimmed average of the log expression ratios, and performed differential analysis fitting a negative binomial generalized log-linear model. For microarrays, we used already normalized data with median intensity threshold of > = 336and applied single-channel experimental design for several groups with Bonferroni adjustment. For further gene expression, we included genes with false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 in the first time point, and used log fold-change (logFC) score in the following timepoints to assess the gene expression chronic change. Up- or down-regulated genes were defined as increase or decrease of logFC in the first timepoint versus control, respectively. For trend analysis, we performed an anova test on linear regression gradient. Ion-specific effects on DNA methylation profile 48 h after irradiation The distribution of differentially methylated probes indicates a stochastic process Further, to check whether DNA methylation changes occur in a close relationship to each other and around the radiation beam, we built differentially methylation regions (DMRs) from previously identified paired DMPs (Fig.S1G). In total, we identified 3805, 4863 and 3631 DMRs for56Fe 0.3 Gy versus28Si 0.3 Gy;56Fe 1 Gy versus28Si 1 Gy;56Fe 1 Gy versus X 1 Gy, pair comparisons, respectively. Interestingly, only 41%, 47% and 43% of DMPs built DMRs, respectively, leaving more than 50% of identified DMPs outside of DMRs (Fig.S1H). As such, we applied a larger base pair limit for DMRs building, however, did not observe a relevant change in amount of DMRs (Fig.S1I). Finally, by permutating methylation probe names from primary dataset, we simulated differential DNA methylation analysis in one thousand unique datasets. In all replicates, we observed lower frequencies of DMPs building DMRs when compared to primarily established comparisons (p< 0.001). This observation suggested that the distribution of radiation induced DNA methylation changes seems to be spread across the whole genome rather than being grouped in DMRs. Assignment of differentially methylated probes (DMPs) to genomic location Radial chromosomal distribution in nucleus affects changes in DNA methylation profiles after irradiation Further, we investigated whether DNA methylation changes are conditioned by the epigenetic state and chromatin physical properties. We studied the induced DNA methylation changes in the context of 3D chromatin structure and histone modification profiles in untreated cells. We overlapped Hi-C compartment coordinates of IMR-90 human lung fibroblast cell line provided by Rao et al.12with baseline probes analyzed previously6. We identified 430,748 probes to which we assigned a compartment Hi-C score which determines the positioning of certain probes in cell nucleus. The greater the score is, the deeper into nucleus a certain probe should be located (Fig.2A)40. As such, we drew an approximate radial positioning of each chromosome in the nucleus and later investigated its impact on the frequency of DNA methylation sites (Fig.S2A). First, we normalized the number of DMPs on each chromosome with regard to the total number of probes on each chromosome used in the experiment. This way corrected for bias associated with the design of the microarray. The highest DMPs prevalence was observed on chromosomes 4, 13, 10 for56Fe (Fig.2B; Fig.S2B–D); 4, 2, 18, 14 for28Si (Fig.S2E,F) and 13, 18, 15 for X (Fig.S2G). Radial nucleus architecture and DNA methylation patterns. (A) The schematic representation of nucleus division based on the high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) technique score. Layers boundaries were assigned quantile 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% and 100% values of Hi-C score of all raw probes used in the primary experiment. Hence, each layer contains the same amount of DNA, but can vary in width. (B) Chromosome positioning of non-irradiated primary probes among five nucleus layers (dashed red lines). Chromosomes 13, 10 and 4 have the highest 48-h DMPs frequency after Fe 1 Gy exposure. Y axis represents a Hi-C score for individual DMP. (C) The frequency of DMPs and non-irradiated probes among nucleus layers. (D) Chromosomal frequencies of DMPs in each nucleus layer (data shown for Fe 1 Gy exposure). Top three chromosomes with the highest overall DMPs frequency are bolded. Boxplots represent data for whole genome. (E) Absolute mean DNA methylation change in DMPs versus control among nucleus layers. Accordingly, we looked at the absolute methylation change across distinct layers. We discovered the highest DNA methylation change being present around the middle “L3” layer (Fig.2E;S2N). Interestingly, the methylation change induced by56Fe persisted until the “L5” having the lowest value in “L1” whereas the effect of28Si and—ray seemed to be limited having the lowest change in “L5”. In summary, these observations could suggest that outer layers of nucleus absorb the highest radiation dose, thus having more differently methylated sites, however, they are randomly distributed across all chromosomes without a particular pattern. Interestingly, despite high frequency of DMPs in outer layers, the average methylation change peaks in the middle “L3” layer which may suggest other factors limiting the effect of GCR radiation in outer layers of nucleus. Irradiation induced DNA methylation patterns are associated with histone modification Radial nucleus architecture of histone modifications. (A) The frequency of distinct histone modifications among non-irradiated primary probes. (B) The distribution of distinct histone modifications among non-irradiated primary probes within nucleus radial layers. (C) The probability of DMP overlapping distinct histone modification peak in each nucleus layer. (D–F) Absolute mean DNA methylation change versus control among histone modification peaks overlapped with DMPs within nucleus layers. (G) Absolute mean DNA methylation change versus control among histone modification associated regulatory regions overlapped with DMPs within nucleus layers. Looking at the spatial baseline average methylation level inside histone modifications picks, heterochromatin-associated marks (H3K9me3, H3K27me3) had higher baseline methylation levels than euchromatin-associated marks (H3K27ac, H3K4me3; Fig.S4A). Specifically, as for H3K27ac and H3K4me3, the methylation level was rather stable (p= 0.22;p= 0.087, respectively) across distinct nucleus layers whereas among H3K9me3, H3K27me3 a methylation increase was observed towards the inner layers (p= 0.027). Next, we checked for absolute methylation changes (vs. control) induced by irradiation in epigenetic modifications. We found that, regardless of radiation type and dose, the average absolute methylation change in each mark was rather stable, without a particular trend observed between nucleus layers (p> 0.05; Fig.3D–F;S3B–D). However, when compared the mean absolute methylation change to all DMPs, we discovered that the methylation change was higher in all histone marks, regardless of radiation type and dose (except Si 0.3 Gy; Fig.3D–F;S3B–D). Furthermore, to investigate the DNA methylation patterns in regulatory elements, we overlapped transcription starting sites (TSS) regions with H3K4me3 and H3K27ac histone marks using GENCODE annotation41. Additionally, we examined H3K27ac associated gene enhancers outside of TSS and gene bodies. In total, we included five distinct groups of regions in the analysis: (1) H3K4me3-associated promoters; (2) H3K27ac-associated promoters; (3) H3K4me3- and H3K27ac-associated promoters; (4) no histone associated promoters; (5) H3K27ac-associated enhancers. Chronic (> 48 h) DNA methylation patterns of various radiation types in in-vitro and in vivo models Persistence of DNA methylation and gene expression change over time. (A,B) Mean DNA methylation change versus control over time with inclusion of direction of methylation change. (C) The schematic representation of gene expression data used to check for corresponding chronic patterns. (D,E) The average change of gene expression in mice liver over time among up-regulated and down-regulated genes. (F) The absolute mean gene expression changes among nucleus layers for differentially expressed genes. (G,H) The average change of change expression in astronauts’ blood over time among up-regulated and down-regulated genes. Accordingly, we observed corresponding long-term gene expression patterns in mice liver tissue, irradiated with56Fe 0.2 Gy particles. For both the sets up-regulated and down-regulated genes the change of average gene expression level was the highest a month after irradiation and later stabilized, and persisted up to 12 months (p= 0.05,p= 0.01, respectively; Fig.4D,E). On the other side, in microarrays data, we observed corresponding short-term gene expression patterns in mice heart tissue, irradiated with56Fe 0.15 Gy particles (p= 0.33 andp= 0.17, respectively; Fig.S4B-C). We also examined, long-term gene expression patterns in mice breast tissue, irradiated with28Si 0.3 Gy particles and observed corresponding, however not significant, pattern to our in vitro analysis. Hence, fluctuating towards baseline level in the last point of observation (Fig.S4D,E). Finally, to check if observed expression patterns are specific for each radiation type, we investigated the chronic effect of protons, gamma rays,137Cs and57Co, exposing distinct gene expression patterns over time (Fig.S4F–L; see method for details). This is the first study exposing influence of chromatin physical properties on DNA methylation patterns triggered by high-LET and low-LET radiation. Our work shows that each of investigated radiation types induce distinct DNA methylation patterns. Additionally, we exposed the major role of spatial chromosomal positioning and distribution of histone modifications which have undeniable influence on the effect of cosmic radiation on human cells. Finally, we validated our in vitro observations regarding chronic effect of high-LET particles, with in vivo models and astronauts’ data. As such, we supported our primary analysis with gene expression data of radiation exposed mice tissues including liver, heart, mammary gland, blood and retina as well as blood tissue from six JAXA astronauts’. Interestingly, in recent years other researchers investigated both DNA methylome and transcriptome changes in several tissues exposed to spaceflight. In retinas of mice flown to space for 37-days period, Chen et al. found a large number of differentially methylated (DM) genes and fewer differentially expressed genes at the transcriptome level. Majority of DM sites were hypomethylated and located in genes and promoters. The functional analysis of these data revealed that spaceflight had a major effect on extracellular matrix/cell junction and cell proliferation/apoptosis signaling42. On the other side, Acharya et al. demonstrated increased DNA methylation levels in the hippocampus and ultimately impaired cognitive condition of irradiated mice which could be mitigated by 5-iodotubercidin administration43. Finally, in NASA Twins Study, despite observing minor genome-wide DNA methylation changes, the gene enrichment analysis showed that during flight genes involved in the response to platelet-derived growth factor and T cell differentiation, and activation pathways in both CD4 and CF8 cells were enriched. Specifically, for CD4 cells genes involved in platelet aggregation, regulation of ossification, and cellular response to UV-B were enriched, whereas for CD8 cells genes involved in somatostatin signaling pathway and positive regulation of superoxide anion generation were enriched44. To further investigate the methylation data, our analyses focused on the impact of spatial chromosomal positioning on DNA methylation patterns or radiation properties and in vivo validation of induced epigenome imprints45. At first, based on spatial chromosome distribution, we tried to establish features associated with DMPs prevalence. At the beginning, we associated the higher frequency with outer positioning of chromosomal fragments in “L1” layer and its absence in “L5” layer. Hence, suggesting that when penetrating the nucleus, externally exposed DNA fragments are at the highest exposure to radiation beams which effect decreases with nucleus depth4. This observation however seemed promising, was not persistent for the whole genome, proposing the influence of other unknown factors. Recently, Garcia-Nieto et al.11, demonstrated that epigenome architecture in ultra violet (UV) irradiated non-malignant lung fibroblasts cells plays a role of a barrier to cancer development by regulation of carcinogen susceptibility. These findings highlighted the role of H3K9me3 modification in accumulating UV-induced DNA lesions in external heterochromatin regions, thus protecting inner localized euchromatin. As such, we looked at the spatial distribution of epigenetic histone modifications which may also play a role in the context of GCR11,46. Likewise, we observed the highest prevalence of DMPs in the periphery with the highest DNA methylation changes among active promoter and enhancers regions marked with H3K4me3 and H3K27ac histone modifications. However, when looking at all identified DMPs the highest methylation change was observed around the middle layer, right after the euchromatin-associated histone marks overcame the heterochromatin-associated H3K9me3 histone mark. Additionally, from that point, we started to observe a similar DMP chromosomal frequency pattern, suggesting the higher radiation vulnerability to occur differentially methylated sites as well as higher DNA methylation changes, especially among internally located promoters and enhancers sites. Specifically, this could be associated with higher chromatin accessibility. In summary, our study provides novel insights towards epigenetic nuclear architecture. We showed that GCR particles induce unique acute and chronic DNA methylation and gene expression patterns. Moreover, for the first time, we highlighted the role of spatial distribution of key epigenetic modification. Specifically, we point out the major role of heterochromatin associated domains in DNA accessibility and radiation response. Finally, we showed which regions of human genome are the most vulnerable to GCR and thus associated with higher DNA methylation changes. To overcome the main limitation of the study resulting from analyzing similar, but not the same cell types (bronchial epithelial cells and bronchial fibroblasts), we run additional analysis using in vivo models and human tissues. Importantly, all key in vitro findings were successfully validated across more advanced models.
