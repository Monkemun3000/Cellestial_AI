  "content": "Identification of a novel Golgi-localized putative glycosyltransferase protein inArabidopsis thaliana E-mail:uemura.tomohiro@ocha.ac.jpTel: +81-3-5978-5713 Received 2023 Nov 2; Accepted 2023 Dec 14. SNAREs play an important role in the process of membrane trafficking. In the present research, we investigated subcellular localization of an uncharacterizedArabidopsis thalianaprotein reported to interact with atrans-Golgi network-localized Qa-SNARE, SYNTAXIN OF PLANTS 43. Based on the similarity of its amino acid sequence to metazoan fucosyltransferases, we have named this novel protein AtGTLP (Arabidopsis thalianaGlycosylTransferase-LikeProtein) and predicted that it should be a member of yet uncharacterized family of Arabidopsis fucosyltransferases, as it shows no significant sequence similarity to fucosyltransferases previously identified in Arabidopsis. AtGTLP is a membrane-anchored protein, which exhibits a type II-like topology, with a single transmembrane helix and a globular domain in the C-terminal part of its amino acid sequence. Colocalization data we collected suggest that AtGTLP should localize mainly to Golgi apparatus, especially to certain zones oftrans-Golgi. As singleatgtlp−/−mutants showed no obvious difference in phenotype (primary root length and fresh mass), AtGTLP and proteins related to AtGTLP with high similarity in amino acid sequences may have redundant functions. An efficient and well-organized intracellular transport system is a basic requirement for life to exist, as many components necessary for metabolic processes, that take place inside or outside of a eukaryotic cell, are produced and subsequently modified in different cell compartments. The transport system responsible for delivering cargo collected from one compartment (that is: a membrane-enclosed organelle, such as endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, or vacuole) to its next destination has been given the name of “membrane traffic”. In the membrane traffic, macromolecules are packed as cargo into vesicles, which then carry the cargo to another organelle, plasma membrane or extracellular space. SNARE (solubleN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor) proteins, a family of membrane-anchored proteins comprising of more than 60 members in Arabidopsis (Sanderfoot 2007), play an important role in this transport system. Assisted by other molecules, such as Rab GTPases and tethering factors, SNAREs mediate fusion between the membrane of vesicle carrying the cargo and the membrane of the organelle the cargo is addressed to (Stenmark 2009). To facilitate the fusion, SNAREs form a complex comprising of four SNAREs—three Q-SNAREs (Qa-, Qb-, Qc-SNARE), which reside on the target membrane and are characterized by the presence of glutamine as the central amino acid in SNARE motif, in addition to one R-SNARE residing on the transport vesicle, with arginine as the central amino acid (Fasshauer et al. 1998). When a R-SNARE comes into contact with the three Q-SNAREs, first a link is formed between the vesicle and the target membrane, and subsequently, due to the change in conformation of the SNARE complex from “loose” to “tight” state, the vesicle is pulled toward the target membrane, allowing the two membranes to fuse together and the cargo to enter the lumen of the organelle (Jahn and Scheller 2006). To ensure the specificity of fusion, a large number of SNAREs localizes selectively to a specific cell compartment. This characteristic made it possible for those SNAREs to be successfully used as organelle markers in subcellular localization studies (Uemura et al. 2004). Through their crucial role in membrane trafficking, members of SNARE family in plants were reported to be implicit in a variety of biological processes, ranging from growth to biotic/abiotic stress resistance. One group of SNAREs, that has been linked to secretion-dependent resistance against pathogens, is SYP4 (SYNTAXIN of PLANTs 4) group. SYP4 group comprises of three members (SYP41, SYP42 and SYP43) with partially overlapping functions, all localizing to the TGN (trans-Golgi network).syp42−/−syp43−/−double mutant exhibits phenotype of shorter roots, semi-dwarfism, and early senescence, in addition to increase in susceptibility to host-adapted virulent powdery fungusGolovinomyces orontiiinfection, when compared to wild type (Uemura et al. 2012). A research focused on interactome of Qa-SNARE proteins in Arabidopsis reported a number of new interactions between specific SNARE proteins and numerous proteins of diverse functions, including novel proteins with unknown functions (Fujiwara et al. 2014). One such interaction was found between SYP43 and an uncharacterized protein, which we decided to name AtGTLP (Arabidopsis thalianaGlycosylTransferase-LikeProtein) due to the similarity to glycosyltransferases in its amino acid sequence. Glycosyltransferases (GTs) are a large family of enzymes, characterized by their ability to transfer sugar moieties to a specific acceptor substrate creating a glycosidic bond. GTs are known to produce a variety of glycoproteins and small sugar-containing molecules with diverse biological roles, but in plants, these enzymes are especially important for processing products of photosynthesis and for biosynthesis of cell-wall (Keegstra and Raikhel 2001). At present, 567 Arabidopsis proteins recorded in the Carbohydrate Active Enzyme Database (CAZy) (Cantarel et al. 2009; http://www.cazy.org/e1.html, accessed Nov 1, 2023) with ‘GlycosylTransferase’ annotation have been further classified into 45 of 117 GT families known today (including GT0 or GTnc, ‘non-classified’). Independently from the sequence-based classification implemented in CAZy database, GTs can also be categorized according to the type of sugar they use as a substrate. One such example is the superfamily of fucosyltransferases (FUTs), which utilize guanidine 5′-diphosphate-β-L-fucose (GDP-Fuc) as a substrate (Martinez-Duncker et al. 2003). In plants, macromolecules known to incorporate fucose in their structures areN-glycans,O-fucosylated proteins, as well as components of cell walls, such as xyloglucans, arabinogalactan proteins and pectic polysaccharides—rhamnogalacturonan I (RG-I) and rhamnogalacturonan II (RG-II) (Soto et al. 2019). Based on characteristics of FUTs that have been identified thus far (a majority of which are putative fucosyltransferases), it has been established that fucose is attached to each of these types of macromolecules by a specific FUT(s). As our knowledge about plant FUTs is still lacking, the full scope of their biological functions is, at present, not fully understood. In the present study, we observed subcellular localization of AtGTLP by cross-pollinating a transgenic Arabidopsis line expressing AtGTLP-mGFP construct with organelle marker lines, as the first step to investigate the functions of AtGTLP. Plant material and growth conditions For colocalization observations, Arabidopsis plants were grown in growth chamber, in 22°C in long-day light (16 h/8 h, L/D) conditions on MS medium w/vitamins (Duchefa Biochemie), containing 0.3% gellan gum (Wako) and 2% sucrose. pH was adjusted to 6.265. Fluorescence was observed in cells in the elongation zone of roots of 5-day-old seedlings. A 5.1 kbp fragment of nucleotide sequence comprising of the native promoter andAtGTLP(At2g04280) gene sequence flanked by 5′ and 3′ UTRs was amplified using PrimeSTAR® GXL DNA Polymerase (Takara). The amplified sequence was subsequently subcloned into a pENTR™ vector using pENTR™/D-TOPO Vector Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) for directional cloning. The vector was used to transform One Shot™ TOP10 Chemically CompetentEscherichia coli(ThermoFisher Scientific). Transformants were selected on solid LB medium with kanamycin 50 mg l−1and cultured overnight in liquid LB with the same antibiotic concentration. Isolated plasmid was linearized and fused with monomeric GFP (mGFP) (Segami et al. 2014) gene sequence using In-Fusion HD Kit (Takara). Product of this reaction was used to transform competentE. colicells and the transformants selection procedure was repeated. Isolated plasmid was used as the entry clone for pHGW vector (Karimi et al. 2002) as the destination vector in Gateway™ LR Clonase™ II reaction (ThermoFisher Scientific).AtGTLP-mGFPin pHGW construct was transformed into competentE. colicells and transformant colonies were selected on solid LB medium with 100 mg l−1spectinomycin. For creation of mRFP-GOS12 Golgi marker line, translational fusion betweenmRFP(Campbell et al. 2002) andGOS12were generated by inserting cDNA encodingmRFPin front of the start codon ofGOS12genomic sequence including 1.9 kb of the 5′-flanking sequence and 1.2 kb of the 3′-flanking sequence in pENTR™ vector using In-Fusion HD Kit. The resulted mRFP-GOS12 construct was subcloned into pGWB1 by LR Clonase™ II (Nakagawa et al. 2007). Generation of Arabidopsis transformants Col-0 plants were infected withAgrobacterium tumefacienstransformed with the prepared plasmid containing theAtGTLP-mGFPconstruct using flower dip method (Clough and Bent 1998). Collected seeds were sown on MS medium with 2% sucrose, 0.8% agar with 25 mg l−1of hygromycin and 250 mg l−1of claforan. Selection of T1lines with a singleAtGTLP-mGFPconstruct was conducted by sowing T2seeds on selective MS medium with hygromycin. Lines, for which we observed 3 : 1 segregation ratio of resistant to non-resistant plants, were selected as single-insertion lines. Confocal laser scanning microscopy observations For subcellular localization observations of AtGTLP protein, AtGTLP-mGFP single-insertion lines were cross-pollinated with organelle markers lines. mRFP-VAMP721 (Uemura et al. 2019) and tagRFP-VAMP727 (Ebine et al. 2008) lines were used as markers for transport vesicle from the TGN to the cell plate/plasma membrane or to the vacuole, respectively. mRFP-SYP61 (Shimizu et al. 2021), mRFP-SYP43 (Asaoka et al. 2013), and VHAa1-mRFP (Dettmer et al. 2006) lines were used as TGN markers. ST-mRFP was used as atrans-Golgi marker (Uemura et al. 2012) and mRFP-GOS12 as a Golgi marker (in this study). Colocalization observations were conducted using Zeiss LSM980 with Airyscan 2 confocal laser scanning microscope system equipped with Plan-Apochromat 63x/1.40 Oil DIC M27 immersion objective. Excitation laser wavelengths of 488 nm and 543 nm were used. Pinhole was set to 1AU. The degree of colocalization of each organelle marker with AtGTLP-mGFP was assessed by calculating Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) (Adler and Parmryd 2010;Dunn et al. 2011). To obtain PCC values, Coloc 2 plugin for Fiji/ImageJ software (Schindelin et al. 2012) was used. For each organelle marker, three 50 µm×50 µm images with 15 randomly selected regions of interest (ROIs), freehand-drawn around the observed dot-like structures, were used for analysis (45 ROIs total for each marker). Noise in the images was corrected using the ‘Smooth’ function of Fiji/ImageJ. Line fluorescence intensity plots were generated using RGB profiler plugin for Fiji/ImageJ. AtGTLP is a putative glycosyltransferase Figure 1. (A) Schematic model of AtGTLP topology and (B) AlphaFold2 prediction of the three-dimensional structure of AtGTLP. AtGTLP comprises of a short N-terminal tail, single transmembrane helix and globular domain in the C-terminal part of amino-acid sequence positioned on a short stalk (type II topology).

Some of the regions in the N-terminal side have score less than 50 and the structures of those regions are less reliable. (D) Predicted three-dimensional structure of AtGTLP in pLDDT coloring. An α-helix at the bottom is the N-terminal side. Blue color indicates less reliable region and red color indicates region with high reliability. Note that the region with similar structure toO-fucosyltransferase 2 has high reliability. (E) Predicted Alignment Error (PAE). N-terminal side has high error (red), and C-terminal side has low error (blue). (F) Superposition between the three-dimensional structure of AtGTLP (from 260 to 566) and that of human proteinO-fucosyltransferase 2 (PDB ID: 4AP6, A chain). The region in white in AtGTLP is the N-terminal region that was not included in the superposition. The gradation coloring scheme was employed from N-terminal to C-terminal side on the superposed region. HumanO-fucosyltransferase 2 is colored in gray with GDP analogue in ball-and-stick model which suggests the active site of the protein. Root mean square deviation (RMSD) of the backbone is 5.9 Å. The similarity of the location of α-helices can be noticed. AtGTLP is localized mainly on thetrans-Golgi Figure 2. Subcellular localization of AtGTLP.

(A)–(G) left panel—en face orientation of AtGTLP ring; right panel—side orientation of AtGTLP ring. Intensity plot was generated along and in direction of the white arrow. Scale bar=1 μm. atgtlp mutants exhibit no obvious phenotypes According to data available in eFP Browser (Klepikova Arabidopsis Atlas;Klepikova et al. 2016),AtGTLPis expressed in most parts of a plant, including roots and young leaves, with the exception of dry seeds. Trans-Golgi localization of AtGTLP Our data suggest that whilst AtGTLP partially colocalized with TGN markers, SYP61 and VHAa1, and to a lesser extent, SYP43, in a portion of the analyzed ROIs, the number of ROIs, where the Pearson correlation coefficient was close to 0, which suggests no colocalization, is noteworthy. TGN is a vesicular-tubular compartment adjacent to thetransside of a Golgi apparatus, but generally considered to be a distinct organelle with functions different from the Golgi (Griffiths and Simons 1986). Indeed, more recently, existence of two types of TGN in plant cells, Golgi-associated TGN (GA-TGN) and Golgi-independent TGN (free-TGN/GI-TGN)—a subpopulation of the TGN that is physiologically separated from Golgi stacks, has been reported (Staehelin and Kang 2008;Uemura et al. 2014;Viotti et al. 2010). The general role of TGN is to receive proteins modified in Golgi and direct them either for vacuoles, the plasma membrane or for secretion (Griffiths and Simons 1986) and therefore, this organelle is considered to be an important hub in the membrane traffic system, where cargo proteins are sorted, before being dispatched for their next destination (Keller and Simons 1997). In addition to TGN-resident SNAREs, involved in transport, other TGN-localized proteins include lipid-processing enzymes, which help to pack cargo proteins into transport vesicles (Gu et al. 2001). Glycosylation is a sequential process, in which different types of sugar are added to glycans in a specific order, as the modified macromolecule travels from ER through Golgi apparatus to finally reach the TGN. In mammalian cells, some types of sugars, such as galactose and sialic acid, can be added to glycans in the TGN by TGN-localized GTs (Rabouille et al. 1995;Stanley 2011). In plants, however, there are no reports of glycotransferase activity in the TGN. Based on the collected data, we therefore propose that AtGTLP is atrans-Golgi-localized protein. AtGTLP—a novel fucosyltransferase? Analysis of AtGTLP amino acid sequence has shown that its C-terminal domain bears resemblance to the conserved domain found in metazoan POFUTs, although no obvious sequence similarity was found between AtGTLP and the proteins which have been previously classified as members of FUT family in Arabidopsis. Although, at present, we lack evidence that would confirm GT or FUT activity in AtGTLP, we consider that this protein may potentially belong to a yet uncharacterized family of Arabidopsis proteins with either GT or FUT activity. One interesting possibility that is worth considering is that AtGTLP is indeed a POFUT. Phylogenetic analyses report putative POFUTs in plants and suggest plant POFUTs are phylogenetically distant from POFUTs families in other organisms (POFUT1 and POFUT2 families) (Hansen et al. 2012;Soto et al. 2019). Interestingly however, recently described Arabidopsis putative POFUT,O-FUCOSYLTRANSFERASE1 (AtOFT1), implicit in pollen tube penetration through the stigma-style interface, was reported to diverge from this pattern. Phylogenetic analysis ofAtOFT1has shown that it exhibits a relatively high sequence identity to members of POFUT1 family, compared to other putative POFUTs found in Arabidopsis (Smith et al. 2018). As in silico analysis suggests that AtGTLP may also be potentially related to metazoan POFUTs, the possibility that yet uncharacterized families of POFUTs, more related to metazoan POFUTs than previously reported POFUTs, exist in Arabidopsis genome is worth further examinations. In our subcellular localization study, we found that AtGTLP localizes mainly totrans-Golgi. Human POFUT1 and POFUT2 localize to the ER (Luo and Haltiwanger 2005;Luo et al. 2006), where theO-glycosylation process for most proteins starts (Stanley 2011). Arabidopsis POFUT with confirmed activity, SPINDY, is known to be active in nucleus/cytoplasm (Bi et al. 2023;Kumar et al. 2023;Zentella et al. 2023). However, it is the only POFUT discovered thus far with this subcellular localization (Sun 2021). On the other hand, putative Arabidopsis POFUTs, such as AtOFT1 (Robichaux et al. 2023;Smith et al. 2018), as well as FRIABLE1 (Neumetzler et al. 2012) and ESMERALDA1 (Verger et al. 2016) were experimentally shown to localize to Golgi. In addition, α1,3-fucosylation in sycamore cells, as well as α1,4-fucosylation by FUT13 in Arabidopsis was shown to occur mainly intrans-Golgi cisternae (Fitchette-Lainé et al. 1994;Schoberer et al. 2013), suggesting that fucose is available at plant Golgi to be used as a substrate. In relation to AtGTLP showing distant similarity to metazoan POFUTs, alternative possibility is that it may be a new type of plant fucosyltransferase. One type of macromolecules, which contain fucose are pectic polysaccharides—RG-I and RG-II. At present, biosynthesis of RG-I and RG-II is not fully understood, and no specific fucosyltransferase, which could be linked to synthesis of RG-I and RG-II side chains, has been identified (Soto et al. 2019;Voxeur et al. 2012), suggesting that yet uncharacterized type of fucosyltransferase is present in plants and responsible for this process. GTs are a diverse family of enzymes and very few members of FUT family in Arabidopsis has been well-characterized thus far. Despite the fact that characteristics of AtGTLP, such as itstrans-Golgi localization, type II topology and the presence ofO-FUT-like conserved domain, seem to agree with the assumption that it is a member of the glycosyltransferase family, the data currently available are not enough to conclusively state that AtGTLP is a GT or a type of FUT, precisely. Under standard growth conditions,atgtlp−/−single mutant displayed phenotype indistinguishable from Col-0 plants and one possible explanation for this result is that AtGTLP and related proteins with high amino acid sequence similarity to AtGTLP might have redundant functions. Protein At4g12700, which shows a very high sequence similarity to AtGTLP is one potential candidate. Further research is needed to confirm the presence of glycosyltransferase/fucosyltranferase activity, as well as the biological role of AtGTLP. We thank K.
