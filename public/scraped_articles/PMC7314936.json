The Advanced Plant Habitat (APH) is the largest research plant growth facility deployed on the International Space Station (ISS). APH is a fully enclosed, closed-loop plant life support system with an environmentally controlled growth chamber designed for conducting both fundamental and applied plant research during experiments extending as long as 135 days. APH was delivered to the ISS in parts aboard two commercial resupply missions: OA-7 in April 2017 and SpaceX-11 in June 2017, and was assembled and installed in the Japanese Experiment Module Kibo in November 2018. We report here on a 7-week-long hardware validation test that utilized a root module planted with bothArabidopsis(cv. Col 0) and wheat (cv. Apogee) plants. The validation test examined the APH’s ability to control light intensity, spectral quality, humidity, CO2concentration, photoperiod, temperature, and root zone moisture using commanding from ground facilities at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC). The test also demonstrated the execution of programmed experiment profiles that scheduled: (1) changes in environmental combinations (e.g., a daily photoperiod at constant relative humidity), (2) predetermined photographic events using the three APH cameras [overhead, sideview, and sideview near-infrared (NIR)], and (3) execution of experimental sequences during the life cycle of a crop (e.g., measure photosynthetic CO2drawdown experiments).Arabidopsisand wheat were grown in microgravity to demonstrate crew procedures, planting protocols and watering schemes within APH. The ability of APH to contain plant debris was assessed during the harvest of matureArabidopsisplants. Wheat provided a large evaporative load that tested root zone moisture control and the recovery of transpired water by condensation. The wheat canopy was also used to validate the ability of APH to measure gas exchange of plants from non-invasive gas exchange measurements (i.e., canopy photosynthesis and respiration). These features were evaluated by executing experiment profiles that utilized the CO2drawdown technique to measure daily rates of canopy photosynthesis and dark-period CO2increase for respiration. This hardware validation test confirmed that APH can measure fundamental plant responses to spaceflight conditions. The goal of this hardware validation test was to demonstrate that the APH facility was fully operational and capable of conducting fundamental plant research in microgravity onboard the ISS. The functionality of APH subsystems was verified, as well as the ability of APH to grow two plant species in microgravity during a 7-week period. Minimal ground testing was conducted in an APH engineering development unit (i.e., a similar but non-flight qualified version of the APH) to ensure wheat andArabidopsisplants would germinate using the watering protocols recommended by the APH design team. The operation of the APH facility was verified by executing experiment profiles that controlled: (1) the environmental conditions during growth of each plant species, (2) chamber CO2to obtain daily gas exchange data from a plant canopy, and (3) chamber CO2and light intensity to conduct pre-programmed CO2drawdown experiments. The primary goal of several decades of spaceflight plant research has been to determine if plant growth, development, and reproduction in microgravity is similar to that on Earth (Stutte et al., 2015;Zabel et al., 2016). The goal of this research was to determine if future plant-based Bioregenerative Life Support Systems (BLSS) growing crops for human colonies on the Moon or Mars (Averner et al., 1984;Wheeler, 2010,2017) can be sized using 1 g data (Monje et al., 2005). In addition, NASA has recently identified the need for new technologies in space crop production and food safety for supplementing the space diet with fresh leafy green crops in near term ISS, cislunar, and lunar missions (Massa et al., 2015;Anderson et al., 2017). Spaceflight plant research is conducted in plant chambers designed to operate in reduced gravity. Previous spaceflight experiments found that indirect effects of microgravity reduce plant growth in space (Musgrave et al., 1997;Monje et al., 2003). These indirect effects include: (1) altered behavior of liquids and gases affecting fluid behavior phenomena, (2) capillary-driven moisture redistribution resulting in poor root-zone aeration, and (3) the absence of buoyancy-driven convection causing poor mass and heat transfer to leaves and plant organs (Musgrave et al., 1997;Musgrave, 2002;Monje et al., 2003;Heinse et al., 2007;Kitaya et al., 2010;Stutte et al., 2015). Other considerations include the limited availability of resources in spacecraft (i.e., mass, power and volume) for plant chambers (Zabel et al., 2016). As a result, plant growth systems for conducting spaceflight experiments [e.g., Advanced Astroculture (ADVASC) and the Biomass Production System (BPS)] were designed to mitigate these secondary effects of the spaceflight environment using forced convection and actively watered root modules that provide well-aerated root zones (Stutte et al., 2015;Zabel et al., 2016). However, these systems were limited by small growth areas available for crop production. Larger plant growth systems are required to overcome the remaining challenges in spaceflight plant research. These challenges are to develop and demonstrate the performance of substrate-free, gravity-independent, water delivery systems to safely grow salad crops in reduced gravity environments for supplementing crew diets (Massa et al., 2015;Anderson et al., 2017;Monje et al., 2019;Khodadad et al., 2020). NASA Facilities Enable Future Exploration NASA recently developed two new plant research facilities, Veggie and the APH, for conducting spaceflight plant research on ISS as recommended by the NRC Decadal Survey Study “Recapturing a Future for Space Exploration: Life and Physical Sciences Research for a New Era” (National Research Council, 2011). These facilities have larger plant growth areas (∼0.2 m2) and volumes than previous platforms, and are designed for studying crop production, plant-to-plant interactions, and human-plant-microbial ecosystems using large plants in space (Massa et al., 2016;Khodadad et al., 2020). Veggie uses LED lights, a passive watering system and minimal environmental control consisting of a fan to circulate ISS air through the plant growth volume. Recently, the Veggie was used to grow nutritious lettuce crops that are safe to eat on ISS (Khodadad et al., 2020). In contrast, the APH facility is a research, plant growth chamber that can grow plants under complete environmental control (i.e., spectral quality, light intensity, temperature, relative humidity, CO2and ethylene concentration) for life cycles as long as 135 days (Morrow et al., 2016). It incorporates a root module watering design that is similar to those developed for ADVASC and BPS: a substrate-based water delivery system that actively controls matric potential of the root zone (Morrow and Crabb, 2000;Link et al., 2003;Morrow et al., 2004). The APH has the ability to collect non-destructive data sets (i.e., images and gas exchange rates) for measuring plant growth during spaceflight, and significantly expands the lighting capabilities (e.g., higher light intensities and increased spectral combinations) available for plant research on ISS. The APH measures CO2and water vapor fluxes using non-destructive gas exchange techniques demonstrated on the BPS, a predecessor to the APH with an identical CO2control architecture (Monje et al., 2005). During the ISS Expedition 4 in 2002, the BPS was used to measure the photosynthetic canopy quantum yield (CQY), the conversion of absorbed radiation into gross CO2fixation, of wheat plant stands in microgravity using the CO2drawdown technique (Morrow et al., 2004,2016;Monje et al., 2005;Stutte et al., 2005). In that study, the canopy photosynthetic rates and CQY of 21-day-old wheat in microgravity did not differ from 1g controls at moderate light intensities (Stutte et al., 2005). The APH was designed to also measure canopy photosynthetic rates and CQY during spaceflight, however, at higher light intensities than previously available in the BPS. The APH provides lighting with a wide range in spectral quality and a maximum photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) of 1,000 μmol m–2s–1, which is nearly three times higher than was possible in the BPS. Future plant research conducted in Veggie and APH will enable exploration by improving our understanding of how plants, and their associated microbiomes in leaves and roots, grow in the spaceflight environment. This knowledge is useful for developing suitable countermeasures to mitigate potential problems of crop production, water recycling, and atmosphere revitalization needed for supporting sustainable and long-term human colonies in space (Wheeler, 2010,2017). The growth chamber controls temperature (T; 18–30°C), relative humidity (RH; 50–90%), CO2concentration (400–5,000 μmol mol–1), wind speed (0.3–1.5 m s–1), spectral quality, and provides the highest light level (up to 1,000 μmol m–2s–1) of any spaceflight chamber to date (Massa et al., 2016;Zabel et al., 2016). In its baseline configuration, the plants germinate and grow in the APH Science Carrier (SC), a four-quadrant rooting module, using fertilized substrate-based media. Water for filling the reservoirs and wetting the rooting media are initially supplied from ISS potable water, while the majority of the water for sustaining plant growth and operations is provided by condensed humidity that is recycled back to the reservoir. Soil (media) water content is controlled in each rooting quadrant using an active moisture control system. Currently, the baseline configuration of the SC is a single-use 0.2 m2module that uses a porous granular substrate (1–2 mm arcillite) as rooting media. The media is watered using a manifold of porous ceramic tubes, and moisture content is actively controlled with negative pressure (i.e., suction) to provide optimum root zone water and O2in microgravity (Monje et al., 2005;Stutte et al., 2005;Morrow et al., 2016). The amount of consumable media (∼4 kg per experiment) required by the current APH SC configuration makes this growth system unsustainable for future food production missions beyond low Earth orbit (Monje et al., 2019), but it is adequate for conducting space biology and life-cycle crop production experiments. In space biology experiments, used root modules are often discarded after the plants are harvested because sample return space and down mass from the ISS is limited, however, the APH facility is versatile and can accommodate alternative SC designs for testing future sustainable crop production systems. APH Growth chamber subsystems: Science Carrier [SC;(A–E)] and Growth Light Assembly [GLA;(F–I)]. The SC is packed with 1–2 mm arcillite(A–C). The planting, germination and cultivation procedures were demonstrated in APH during ground studies(D). The Flight SC was shipped wrapped in a Tedlar bag(E). The GLA illuminates plants with LED lighting of different wavelengths: blue 455 nm(F), green 530 nm(G), red 630 nm(H), far-red 735 nm, and white 4100 K. The GLA can also provide mixed light recipes: red, blue, and white(I). The PHARMER also provides the communication path for command uplink to APH and telemetry downlink from APH via the EXPRESS Rack. Commanding of APH from the ground (i.e., teleoperation) was conducted at the Experiment Monitoring Area (EMA) at KSC. Summary of events during hardware validation of APH on ISS. After the APH facility was powered up, the crew filled the Recovery and Distribution reservoirs manually with potable galley water. Thereafter, the remaining activation steps were executed by an operator via commanding from the ground in the EMA at KSC using software and communications channeled via the Marshall Spaceflight Center. The environmental control systems (ECS-A and ECS-B) that control chamber temperature and humidity were primed and adjusted. Once stable temperature and humidity controls were established, it was verified that the ECS modules could control chamber temperature and humidity at the following setpoints: 23°C/70% RH, 18°C/50% RH, 18°C/90% RH, 30°C/90% RH, and 30°C/50% RH. The GC subsystem was powered to enable the chamber pressure, O2, and CO2sensors, as well as, initiate CO2and ethylene control. The APH GLA can generate a wide variety of spectral quality recipes using five LED banks: blue (0–400 μmol m–2s–1at 450 nm), green (0–100 μmol m–2s–1at 525 nm), red (0–600 μmol m–2s–1at 630 nm), white (0–600 μmol m–2s–1at 400–740 nm), and near-infrared (0–50 μmol m–2s–1at 735 nm). The setpoints for each separate blue, green, white, red, and near-infrared LEDs of the GLA were adjusted one at a time and photographs of the illuminated growth chamber were taken to confirm their operation (Figures 2F–H). The main purpose of the first on-orbit plant growth test was to validate that the APH could grow large plants in the spaceflight environment. However, plant growth during spaceflight could not be compared to 1g controls because an identical ground study was not conducted during the validation test. Furthermore, there was no crew time allotted for thinning plants, and there were no provisions to bring back harvested plant samples for analysis on the ground. Instead, non-destructive and non-invasive gas exchange measurements (i.e., photosynthesis and respiration) of anArabidopsis/wheat canopy were recorded daily. Thus, healthy plant growth was ascertained by comparing images and gas exchange data collected during the life cycle of the plants with known values reported in the literature. The photosynthetic responses of anArabidopsis/wheat canopy to light and CO2concentration were measured in microgravity, and compared to literature values from previous studies with wheat conducted at 1g and during spaceflight (Wheeler, 1996;Monje and Bugbee, 1998;Stutte et al., 2005). During the first plant test, the SC was removed from the Tedlar stowage bag and installed in the APH by the crew. The APH was then teleoperated from the ground to water the plants and collect plant growth data without crew involvement. Experiment profiles, scripts that are executed daily by the PHARMER, were uploaded and implemented to capture a daily record of images, environmental and plant performance data. The experiment profiles were also used for conducting pre-programmed CO2drawdown experiments to collect non-destructive gas exchange data. The data collected included GC and SC environmental parameters, daily overhead and sideview images, and daily measurements of photosynthesis and respiration. In addition, the experiment profiles controlled the photoperiod in the GC and the media moisture content in each SC quadrant. The drawdown experiment generated plant response curves to altered CO2concentrations and light intensities. Thus, a major portion of the science capabilities of APH were verified during the first plant test. Environmental Control Systems (ECS) The ECS modules mix the air in the growth chamber by forced convection using fans that remove air from the top of the growth chamber above the plants and return it into the chamber at plant level from opposing sides of the chamber. Fan speeds are controllable from 0.3 to 1.5 m s–1at 0.1 m s–1increments. Replaceable HEPA filters prevent particulates and plant debris from contaminating the internal components of the ECS modules during nominal operating conditions. A goal of the first plant experiment was to demonstrate how the ECS filters would capture plant debris, especially that generated during the growth and harvest of matureArabidopsisplants. Science Carrier (SC) – Preparation and Planting The SC used a porous granular substrate media (arcillite; Turface Pro League Elite, Profile Products, LLC) to provide root anchoring, as well as storage and delivery of water, oxygen, and nutrients to plant roots. Arcillite was first sieved to a particle size of 1–2 mm and then washed with DI water to remove dust. Washing the arcillite was necessary for both crew safety and for reducing the potential for particulate clogging of the porous tubes in the SC quadrants. Sifted and washed arcillite was autoclaved in a covered tray for 30 min and dried in a forced air oven at 70°C for a minimum of 72 h until thoroughly dry. Extensive ground testing was conducted to determine the optimum planting and germination protocols for growingArabidopsison APH. The chosen protocol for germination ofArabidopsisemployed a single layer of medical gauze. An individual medical gauze sheet (Covidien Curity, 4 in × 4 in, 4 ply; Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, United States) was unfolded and placed on top of the tightly packed arcillite. The gauze was covered with washed and sterilized open-celled Roylan orthopedic foam (Performance Heath, Warrenville, IL, United States). The foam covered the majority of each quadrant except for precut strips covered with gauze where the seeds were planted. The foam, medical gauze, and arcillite were secured in place by a polycarbonate cover that contained three centered rows for planting and holes for aeration of the entire quadrant. Wild Type (WT)Arabidopsisseeds cv Col-0 were surface sanitized with successive 70 and 95% ethanol washes, followed by overnight drying, prior to gluing onto the medical gauze. Individual seeds were first dipped onto a small drop of a sterile 1% guar gum solution, then individually glued onto the medical gauze within each of the twoArabidopsisquadrants. In each row of the quadrant, 12 equally spaced planting locations were planted with two seeds. There was no crew time allotted for thinning operations during the validation mission so only two seeds per location were planted. The planting and germination protocols for wheat were adopted and modified from those used in BPS during the PESTO experiment (Monje et al., 2005). Apogee wheat seeds (provided by Bruce Bugbee, Utah State University) were planted in two quadrants using CapMat II wicks (16.5 cm by 4 cm; Phytotronics, Inc., Earth City, MO, United States). The wheat seeds used were not sanitized because it was found that the ethanol wash protocol used for theArabidopsisseeds decreased wheat seed germination down to 20%. Ten seeds were planted in each row for a total of 30 seeds in each quadrant. The wicks and Roylan foam were autoclaved using a 20 min dry cycle. Two CapMat strips were placed together inside slits cut in the Roylan foam to form two capillary wicks that held the seeds during launch and growth in the ISS. Each side of the seed was dipped in sterile 1% guar gum, and the seeds were planted with the embryo tip downward into the arcillite substrate, positioned so that the glued edges of the seeds were in contact with the CapMat II wicks. The wheat quadrants were located closest to the door of the APH growth chamber during the ISS flight experiment to allow plant height determination using the side-viewing IR camera. Science Carrier Flight Configuration In plant ecophysiology, gas exchange systems are used for measuring carbon and water vapor fluxes from photosynthetic organisms (Pearcy et al., 1989;Monje and Bugbee, 1998,2019). These techniques have been used in the 1980s and 1990s during NASA’s Advanced Life Support Program to measure crop radiation use efficiencies and transpiration rates for estimating the size and feasibility of future BLSS (Averner et al., 1984;Rummel and Volk, 1987;Bugbee and Salisbury, 1988;Wheeler, 2010). The APH was designed to permit the measurement of photosynthetic and transpiration rates from the plants within the GC. The system for controlling the CO2concentration of the APH GC provides a means to measure canopy photosynthesis non-destructively using gas exchange techniques pioneered by ecophysiologists in the 1960s (Lange et al., 2001). Plants remove CO2from the chamber atmosphere via photosynthesis when illuminated and add CO2via respiration in the dark. The APH utilizes a semi-closed gas exchange system to maintain chamber CO2setpoint, and acts like a closed system when CO2control is disabled. In the semi-closed system, the chamber CO2setpoint during the photoperiod is maintained by injecting small, known volumes of CO2into the chamber and the photosynthetic rate is determined from the number of CO2pulses injected over a given time period, but chamber leak rate must be known (Pearcy et al., 1989). At night, CO2control is disabled and CO2concentration rises due to dark respiration to a level higher than the daytime setpoint. At the start of the photoperiod when CO2control and ethylene scrubbing are disabled, the chamber operates in closed mode and photosynthesis draws down the chamber CO2concentration down to the daytime setpoint. This daily CO2drawdown was used to measure photosynthetic rates during the development of the plant canopy growing in the APH. The primary goal of the first plant test was to verify that plants can be grown normally within the APH hardware on ISS. A principal investigator who has been awarded a spaceflight experiment utilizing the APH facility chooses the plant species, the environmental conditions for the life cycle, and supplies a pre-planted SC root module. The proposed science objectives are then demonstrated on the ground during science and experiment verification tests. The SC is then launched to ISS, inserted in the APH chamber by the crew, its water lines are connected to the WRADS, and temperature and soil moisture sensors from each quadrant are connected to the PHARMER. The crew closes the APH door and thereafter, the APH is configured by experiment profiles, which control the growth chamber environment and the root zone moisture level for the duration of the life cycle of the chosen plant species. Environmental setpoints and germination rates during the first plant test on APH. TheArabidopsisplants were harvested 6 weeks after planting, during flowering to demonstrate the ability of the APH ECS filter system to contain plant debris during harvest. Images revealed that plant debris was successfully trapped on the inlets to the ECS modules. These modules recirculate chamber air through an inlet protected by a screen and a HEPA filter. A video camera was placed outside the APH to detect debris flying out of the chamber; only one small flower was observed to leave the APH and it was captured by the crew. The inlets to the ECS modules were cleaned with a vacuum after the validation test was completed. The germination rate of the wheat seeds was 80%, which was lower than the 92–97% germination rate observed in the BPS (Stutte et al., 2005). The wheat was grown until anthesis at 33 days after planting and grew next to theArabidopsisplants for ∼25 days. The wheat plants imposed an increased water production load on the environmental control system (i.e., ECS) and an increased water demand load on the root zone watering system of APH (i.e., WRADS). The wheat canopy tested if the APH subsystems used for controlling chamber CO2concentration and water fluxes were sized appropriately to maintain environmental setpoints when large plants are grown under microgravity conditions. Determining the light level regime within the growth chamber is important for interpreting photosynthetic measurements made in the APH because plant height changes during development. The GLA setpoints of the APH correspond to a light intensity measured 10 cm below the LED panel. However, the actual light intensity at plant height is determined by the degree of light attenuation versus height within the GC and by the height of the plants. APH GLA spectra using White, Blue, Green, and Red LEDs:(A)Spectral quality duringArabidopsis(BGR, black line) and wheat (WR, red line) plant tests.(B)Spectral quality during the CO2drawdown experiment (WRB, red line). Comparing the WRB and RB (black line) spectra shows that white LEDs supply additional blue and red light plus substantial amounts of green light. Light attenuation and plant height within APH. Light attenuation under WRB (solid lines) and RB (dashed lines), measured at 900 (blue), 600 (yellow), and 300 (green) μmol m– 2s– 1GLA setpoints, decreases linearly in APH. Wheat canopy height was measured using the grid of the APH door cover. Wheat was 15, 23, and 37 cm tall at 11, 20, and 31 DAP, respectively. The wheat plants were harvested after 33 DAP by Astronaut Norishige “Nemo” Kanai (Image Courtesy NASA used for informational purposes without explicit permission). A CO2drawdown experiment was performed following installation of the dry SC root module on the ISS to determine chamber leak rate of the APH GC. Chamber CO2was raised to 2,000 μmol mol–1, CO2control and ethylene scrubbing were disabled for 3 hr and chamber leak rate was measured according toAcock and Acock (1989). The leak rate of APH on ISS was 5% h–1, which is consistent with leak rates measured during ground studies. The leak rate must be known to correct changes in chamber CO2during the CO2drawdowns used to measure canopy photosynthesis. The CO2drawdown technique is a non-destructive and non-invasive gas exchange technique for measuring photosynthetic rates from changes in chamber CO2concentration. The CO2control system operates the GC as a closed gas exchange system to determine: (1) daily canopy photosynthetic rates, and (2) response curves of photosynthesis to chamber CO2concentration and to light intensity. During a CO2drawdown curve, chamber CO2is raised to 2,000 μmol mol–1, the plants are allowed to acclimate at the desired light level for ∼1 h, then chamber CO2and ethylene control are disabled and a photosynthetic CO2drawdown occurs. Ethylene control must be disabled because the permanganate-filled Purafil SP beads used to control ethylene absorb significant amounts of CO2(Purafil, Inc., Doraville, GA, United States). Net photosynthetic carbon uptake consumes CO2and chamber CO2is reduced at a rate that is proportional to the incident light level. The change in CO2concentration between 2,000 to 1500 μmol mol–1is used to calculate canopy photosynthesis at a saturating CO2concentration. For a CO2drawdown experiment, repeating drawdown curves are conducted at descending light levels ending in a measurement of dark respiration. Daily Canopy Carbon Fluxes in APH Daily photosynthesis and respiration measurements. Daily APH Pnetmeasured from daily CO2drawdown curves and dark respiration (Rdark) rates increased with time as the wheat plants grew and fixed more CO2. The wheat/Arabidopsiscanopy had similar gas exchange rates as wheat plants grown in spaceflight during BPS 2002 and on the ground byWheeler, 1996. A CO2drawdown experiment was conducted to verify that the APH can measure responses of canopy photosynthesis to CO2concentration and light intensity. The CO2drawdown experiment was conducted when the wheat plants were 24 days old and theArabidopsisplants were 41 days old at the daily settings of air temperature (23°C) and chamber humidity (75%). Two CO2drawdown experiments were conducted on consecutive days to determine the repeatability of these measurements. Setpoints for the APH CO2Drawdown Experiment1. 1Units, μmol m–2s–1.2Light intensity at canopy height at 25 DAP. APH CO2Drawdown Experiment.(A)Stepwise changes in GC light intensity (blue line) and(B)CO2concentration (black line) during the two consecutive CO2Drawdown experiments. The CO2control switch [(A,B), gray line] enabled CO2injections [(A), orange line] to raise chamber CO2to 2,000 μmol mol– 1before each drawdown. CO2concentration decreased when CO2control was disabled due to photosynthetic CO2uptake. The CO2injection rate during the second and third drawdowns was not sufficient to overcome canopy Pnetat higher light levels and chamber CO2concentration [(B), black line] did not reach the CO2setpoint [(B), green line] in 1 h. As PPFD decreased, chamber CO2reached the setpoint and even increased above it due to respiration. CO2response curves of canopy photosynthesis during the CO2drawdown experiment: Changes in chamber CO2concentration (inset, dCO25s– 1) from drawdown curves measured at constant PPFD were plotted vs. CO2concentration, fitted with a logarithmic curve, and converted into photosynthetic CO2response curves. Response curves measured during consecutive days are shown as solid and dashed lines. For comparison, the CO2response curve measured during PESTO is plotted (BPS 2002, black circles) and Pnetof wheat increases at higher light levels (Monje and Bugbee, 1998, blue triangle). Light response curves of APH canopy photosynthesis: The APH CQY, the slope of gross photosynthesis vs. absorbed PPFD, represents the photosynthetic conversion of absorbed radiation into fixed CO2. The CQY of the wheat/Arabidopsiscanopy measured in APH (WRB LEDs, purple open circles) is higher than reported in BPS 2002 (CWF lamps, black squares), but comparable to literature values of wheat CQY:Wheeler, 1996(HPS lamps, red diamonds), andMonje and Bugbee, 1998(HPS lamps, blue triangle). Significance of the First Plant Test The APH Facility was installed, assembled and its ability for conducting fundamental plant research on ISS was evaluated and demonstrated. Wheat andArabidopsisplant canopies were successfully grown from seed and harvested after 6 weeks and after 33 days of growth on ISS, respectively. No pre-flight testing was performed on the ground, thus design team recommended settings were used throughout the operation of the APH during the validation test. The planting, germination, and watering protocols for the two species were demonstrated on ISS. The ability to growArabidopsisstems, flowers and siliques was accomplished in 6 weeks and the APH’s ability to contain debris during harvest was demonstrated during harvest of the matureArabidopsisplants. Environmental and non-destructive plant growth data was collected and used to validate the ability of APH to measure photosynthesis, respiration and CQY of a plant canopy during spaceflight.
