  "content": "A multi-omics longitudinal study of the murine retinal response to chronic low-dose irradiation and simulated microgravity Received 2022 Apr 12; Accepted 2022 Aug 29; Collection date 2022. The space environment includes unique hazards like radiation and microgravity which can adversely affect biological systems. We assessed a multi-omics NASA GeneLab dataset where mice were hindlimb unloaded and/or gamma irradiated for 21 days followed by retinal analysis at 7 days, 1 month or 4 months post-exposure. We compared time-matched epigenomic and transcriptomic retinal profiles resulting in a total of 4178 differentially methylated loci or regions, and 457 differentially expressed genes. Highest correlation in methylation difference was seen across different conditions at the same time point. Nucleotide metabolism biological processes were enriched in all groups with activation at 1 month and suppression at 7 days and 4 months. Genes and processes related to Notch and Wnt signaling showed alterations 4 months post-exposure. A total of 23 genes showed significant changes in methylation and expression compared to unexposed controls, including genes involved in retinal function and inflammatory response. This multi-omics analysis interrogates the epigenomic and transcriptomic impacts of radiation and hindlimb unloading on the retina in isolation and in combination and highlights important molecular mechanisms at different post-exposure stages. Subject terms:Retinal diseases, Epigenomics, Transcriptomics Spaceflight hazards such as microgravity and space radiation are anticipated to impact biological systems and could potentially affect crew health and performance both in mission and once astronauts return to Earth. These unique hazards have been thought to induce adverse changes in the central nervous system (CNS), with a frequently reported impact on ocular function1–4. Resources aboard space assets that have a sustained human presence like the International Space Station (ISS) are limited and it is difficult to recreate spaceflight conditions on the ground for controlled experiments. Therefore, characterization of the type and magnitude of these changes is challenging. Despite these challenges, analogs can be used to inform the understanding of the spaceflight environment impacts on biology and support development of mitigation strategies to reduce spaceflight health risks. Ground-based analogs can also support the interrogation of biological effects from disparate stressors in isolation from one another that cannot be untangled in the spaceflight environment. Furthermore, advances in bioinformatics have expanded the potential scientific return of prior experiments provided data is accessible for re-evaluation. Fortunately, NASA’s GeneLab is an open-access omics database for space-relevant biological experiments that provides access to uniformly formatted data5. The current study leverages transcriptomic and methylation sequencing data acquired as part of a larger experiment to understand the longitudinal effects and underlying mechanisms of low-dose ionizing radiation (IR) exposure and hindlimb unloading (HLU; an analog for microgravity) on neurovascular oxidative stress and brain function6. Global transcriptome profiling with RNA-seq quantifies gene expression at the time of sample acquisition while reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) analyzes DNA methylation, which is one of the most studied epigenetic modifications involved in disease development7–9. Previous studies analyzed spaceflight-induced transcriptomic and epigenomic response in murine retina10,11or evaluated response to different ground-based hazard analogs in murine brain6and spleen12. The spaceflight studies reported expression and methylation changes in genes known to be involved in visual perception, phototransduction, and macular degeneration pathways in murine models. However, these studies were performed in space where effects of both space radiation and microgravity on the retina were intertwined. In addition, these studies were performed 35–37 days after a spaceflight and there was no analysis done on longitudinal changes in the retina due to radiation or microgravity. To our knowledge, the current analysis is the first multi-omics study of longitudinal changes in the murine retina due to microgravity, low-dose radiation, or combined exposure to both. We report differentially expressed genes (DEG), differentially methylated genes (DMG), and biological processes (BP) that are exclusive to, or shared across, multiple exposure conditions and post-exposure time points. We observed similar epigenetic and transcriptomic discordance in genes reported in the NASA Twins Study13and in the retina of mice flown to space11, with some changes persistent even 4 months after exposure. This study provides an insight into the retinal response to exposures that are frequently used as analogs for individual spaceflight hazard and their interplay at different post-exposure stages, and contributes towards identifying key pathways to interrogate that may provide translational relevance across exposure types. Number of differentially expressed genes and differentially methylated genes across exposure groups. DEG (|log2(fold-change)|≥ 0.263 and adjustedp-value ≤ 0.05) and DMG (genes containing CpG loci or regions with |percent methylation difference|≥ 10 and adjustedp-value ≤ 0.05) are listed in bold for each experimental group compared to its matched control.

Correlation in methylation differences across exposure groups Pairwise analysis of all methylated loci in genes were compared across our 9 exposure groups (Fig.2B). The highest correlation in methylation difference across different exposures was observed at the same post-exposure time point. Hypermethylation ofBclaf3promoter was observed in four groups (~ 15% in 1m HLU, 4m IR and 4m HLU + IR, and 26% in 1m HLU + IR), and another CpG island inTmc8promoter was common across all three exposure groups at 7 days (10% hypermethylation). The top DMLs shared across all three exposures were inCav2at 7 days (30% hypermethylation),Grip2at 1 month (20% hypermethylation), andSorbs2at 4 months (8% hypermethylation). Overlapping differentially methylated genes across exposure groups A number of genes containing DML or DMR were observed in multiple exposure groups and post-exposure time points (Fig.2C).Bcl11b, Bclaf3, Gse1, Necab2, PlecandTafa5were each differentially methylated in five out of the nine groups. Six genes (Adamts5, Gse1, Rbm15b, Fscn2, Satb1, Tenm3) were shared across different time points after radiation exposure, withAdamts5andFscn2promoters being hypermethylated even after 4 months of exposure to radiation alone. The promoter region ofPcdh19,a protocadherin, was hypermethylated (> 20% methylation difference) at all three time points for HLU + IR and also in HLU alone at 7 days.Bclaf3was hypermethylated in five groups (HLU at 7 days and 1 month, HLU + IR at 1 month and 4 months, and IR and 4 months), and CpG islands inHmgb3promoter were hypermethylated in HLU and HLU + IR at both, 7 days and 1 month.

Over-represented biological processes based on differential methylation Integrated analysis of genes and biological processes impacted at transcriptomic and epigenomic levels A total of 23 genes showed changes in expression and methylation at an adjustedp-value cutoff of 0.05 (Table3).Eef1a1, a protein involved in peptide chain elongation, was down-regulated and hypomethylated in groups exposed to radiation or microgravity 7 days post-exposure. CrystallinCrybb3and signal-induced proliferation-associatedSipa1l3,both implicated in cataract, were up-regulated and hypermethylated 7 days after exposure to IR or HLU, respectively. Fibroblast growth factor 1 (Fgfr1) has been known to mediate photoreceptor rescue effect in response to retinal injury25, and the gene was up-regulated and hypomethylated 7 days after radiation.Ncor2, a gene in the Notch signaling pathway, was up-regulated with hypermethylation in the gene body in 7 days IR. PlectinPlec, a cytolinker protein involved in cytoskeletal organization, was up-regulated and hypermethylated.

GO biological processes and related genes common between RNA-Seq and methylation. Spaceflight is an environment to which Earth-based biological systems have not yet adapted. Changes in gravity as well as radiation exposure that differs from terrestrial radiation both in terms of intensity and type, are the two primary naturally occurring hazards the human body contends with during space travel. It is crucial to characterize the impacts of these hazards to ensure the crew and NASA as an agency are appropriately informed. While hazards will be experienced concurrently in spaceflight, important information about the potential interactions between hazards can reveal how impacts can be appropriately mitigated. Different countermeasure strategies will need to be employed if hazards modulate similar or divergent processes. Several genes known to be implicated in ocular diseases were found to be impacted at the transcriptomic and epigenomic levels. A subset of the 7-days radiation only DEG (Cryaa, Cryba1, Cryba2, Cryba4, Crybb1, Crybb2, Crybb3, Crygs, Bsfp1) were enriched innuclear and congenital cataracts, however, these genes were not dysregulated at 1 month or 4 months. A key component of the MAP kinase signal transduction pathway,Map2k1, was down-regulated in the IR and HLU + IR groups at 7 days but up-regulated at 1 month; MAPK signaling has been shown to be involved in AMD pathogenesis29.Bc1, a non-coding RNA known to affect vascular development14and structural plasticity15was significantly up-regulated in all three exposures at 1 month. Four months after radiation, retention of hypermethylation was observed in genes involved in eye development and pathogenesis includingMyc-associated zinc-finger transcription factorMaz30,disintegrinAdamts5involved in AMD,andFscn2with a role in photoreceptor disk morphogenesis. Interestingly,Adamts5was previously observed to be dysregulated in the murine retina after spaceflight11.Additionally, early differential methylation (only at 7 days and 1 month) was observed inHmgb3,a member of the high-mobility group superfamily and a transcription factor known to be impacted by spaceflight10. A total of 23 genes shared differential expression and methylation (Table3). Of these, 14 had differential methylation in the promoter region and 9 in the gene body with negative correlation between expression and methylation changes in 3 and 6 genes, respectively. The rest showed a positive correlation. Recent studies have expanded the understanding of effects of DNA methylation on gene expression, especially in cancers31.Along with the traditional methylation-induced gene silencing, there have been patterns of consistently positive or negative correlations for all CpG sites associated with specific genes. More work is needed to understand the variation in the impact of DNA methylation on expression across different tissue and cell types, genes, and the location of CpG sites. High-mobility group containingSox9is known to be involved in retinogenesis32and was up-regulated in 7-days HLU and IR groups, and hypomethylated in 7-days HLU.Ppm1ahas been shown to play a crucial role in the wound healing-inflammation-angiogenesis axis in mice33, and was down-regulated and hypermethylated 7 days after radiation but not later.Sphk1plays a key role in the regulation of inflammatory responses34;Sphkap, a modulator ofSphk1, was up-regulated and hypermethylated in 1-month HLU + IR. The glycoproteinB4galt6regulates astrocyte activation during CNS inflammation35and was up-regulated and hypomethylated.Interestingly,Sphk1and glycoproteinsB4galt2andB4galt3were also up-regulated in 7 days HLU + IR based on spleen data from the same set of mice12. Transcriptional co-repressorTle3, involved in Wnt and Notch signaling pathways, was up-regulated and hypermethylated in 1-month HLU + IR. Interestingly, the NASA Twins Study reportedNotch3to show epigenetic discordance based on spaceflight blood samples13and the gene was significantly up-regulated (twofold change) at 7 days post-irradiation in the mouse retina.Rbx1andNcor2, also in the Notch signaling pathway, showed 33% hypermethylation in 4-months HLU + IR, and up-regulation and hypermethylation 7 days post-irradiation, respectively. The NASA Twins Study also reports a decrease during flight inleucine rich alpha-2-glycoprotein 1, a protein involved in retinal vascular pathology.Lrg1was down-regulated by more than fourfold (unadjustedp-value = 0.006) in 1-month HLU and significantly hypermethylated (16.8% methylation difference) in 4-months HLU + IR.
