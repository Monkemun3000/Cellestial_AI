Candida albicansis a commensal fungus that is found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of roughly 65% of individuals (1).C. albicansis an opportunistic pathogen that can cause oral thrush and life-threatening bloodstream infections (2,3). Because of the severity of these infections,C. albicanspathogenesis has been extensively investigated. However, prior to infections,C. albicanslives in the gut and can breach the GI tract to infect the host (4–6). One host setting associated with enrichment forC. albicansin the GI tract is alcohol use disorder (AUD), a condition in which individuals have lost the ability to control or stop their alcohol consumption (7). Estimates suggest roughly 2.3 billion people in the world consume alcohol and over 5% of the world’s adult population has an AUD (8).C. albicansis enriched in the fecal microbiome in individuals with AUD (9–11) and contributes to the progression and severity of ALD (9,10). Immune responses to intestinal fungi correlate with a reduced 5-year survival in those with ALD (9), showing that changes in abundance of intestinal fungi have vital consequences to the host. The gut microbiota can also affect host behavior via effects on the gut-brain axis (GBA). The GBA is defined as the bidirectional communication between the GI tract and the brain (12,13). The GBA has been implicated in many disorders ranging from autism to addiction (14–17). Initial work characterizing the GBA in AUD found dysbiosis in the GI tract can contribute to depression and craving (18). Specific bacteria have been found that contribute to the control of factors crucial to alcohol craving (19,20). Further, fecal microbiota transplants in mice and humans can modulate ethanol preference and craving respectively (21,22). These findings support the model that changes to the microbiome in AUD can regulate ethanol consumption. As a mechanism linking microbiome changes to the GBA in AUD, we investigated the role of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), an eicosanoid compound synthesized from arachidonic acid. A previous study showed that treatment with PGE2reduced ethanol consumption in rats (23). Serum PGE2levels have previously been shown to be higher in antibiotic-treated mice with GI colonization byC. albicans(24). Further, we previously showed thatC. albicanscolonization in mice dysregulated endocannabinoids (25), another set of compounds that utilize arachidonic acid as a precursor (26). The arachidonic acid-derived host lipidome is thus altered inC. albicans-colonized mice. We therefore tested for a role for PGE2in reducing ethanol consumption inC. albicans-colonized mice. C. albicanscolonization in female mice reduces ethanol consumption. Single housed female C57BL/6 mice were orally inoculated withC. albicansstrain CKY101 or PBS. After inoculation, mice were subjected to a 2-bottle choice experiment, with one bottle of 15% ethanol (vol/vol) and one bottle of water. Liquid consumption was measured by weighing the bottles daily.(A)Ethanol consumption (gm ethanol/kg body weight) on the first and second day of access to ethanol.

A two-way ANOVA corrected for repeated measures was performed for statistics (* p=0.0144; ** p<0.0035; *** p<0.0003; **** p<0.0001). C. albicans-colonized mice have elevated serum PGE2and PGE2injection reduces murine ethanol preference. EP Receptor Antagonism Increases Ethanol Consumption and Preference to Mock-Colonized Levels. Increased Serum PGE2inC. albicans-colonized Mice Correlates with Gene Expression in the Brain. We next tested the hypothesis thatC. albicansgut colonization and elevation of PGE2concentration would result in transcriptomic changes in the brain. PGE2binds to its cognate receptors encoded by four different genes,Ep1,Ep2,Ep3, andEp4(30). PGE2has been shown to upregulate expression ofEpreceptor genes in a dose dependent manner in neuronal cell lines and various tissues in the body(31,32). We decided to focus on a region of the brain involved in habit formation, the dorsal striatum (DS) (33), as well as other addiction-implicated regions such as the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAc)(34). Candida albicanscolonization accelerates the onset of conditioned taste aversion in mice. Single housed female C57BL/6 mice were trained to drink their daily liquid in the late morning. Mice orally inoculated withC. albicansstrain CKY101 or PBS were given one hour of access to a novel tastant, 1.2% saline solution, and then injected intraperitoneally with ethanol (2 g/kg or 3 g/kg) or control (sterile saline). Tastant consumption on the first trial (before injection with ethanol) was used as the baseline measurement and consumption on later trials was compared to trial 1.(A)percent change of tastant consumption relative to each individual mouse’s trial one consumption (pre-conditioned stimulus).

C. albicans-colonized mice are more susceptible to the behavioral effects of ethanol and motor coordination deficits can be restored by EP receptor antagonism. Single housed female C57BL/6 mice were orally inoculated withC. albicansstrain CKY101 or PBS on days 0 and 2, and subjected to the behavioral tests illustrated in panel(A). (B,C)Groups are defined as Mock +1x EtOH: mock-colonized, received sterile saline ip injections on days 1 and 3 and 3.5g/kg EtOH on day 4 (open circles); Mock + 3x EtOH: mock-colonized, received 1.5g/kg ethanol ip injected on days 1 and 3 and 3.5g/kg EtOH on day 4 (open triangles); Ca + 1x EtOH:C. albicans-colonized, received sterile saline ip injections on day 1 and 3 and 3.5g/kg EtOH on day 4 (black circles); Ca + 3x EtOH:C. albicans-colonized, received 1.5g/kg ethanol ip injected on days 1 and 3 and 3.5g/kg EtOH on day 4 (black triangles). (D-F)Groups are defined as Mock + SS: mock-colonized, received sterile saline ip injections on days 1 and 3 (open circles); Mock + EtOH: mock-colonized, received 1.5g/kg ethanol ip injected on days 1 and 3 (open triangles); Ca + SS:C. albicans-colonized, received sterile saline ip injections on day 1 and 3 (black circles); Ca + EtOH:C. albicans-colonized, received 1.5g/kg ethanol ip injected on days 1 and 3 (black triangles).(G)Groups are defined as Ca/Mock + SS + Veh, fedC. albicans(black circles) or sterile PBS (open circles), received sterile saline and vehicle injections; Mock + Et + Veh, fed sterile PBS, received ethanol and vehicle injections; Mock + Et + Ants, fed sterile PBS, received ethanol and antagonist injections; Ca + Et + Veh, fedC. albicans, received ethanol and vehicle injections; Ca + Et + Ants, fedC. albicans, received ethanol and antagonist injections. All injections were IP, given before habituation or testing.

Symbols represent individual mice. * p<0.0220; ** p<0.0055; *** p<0.0003; **** p<0.0001. Synergy between the effects ofC. albicanscolonization and the effects of ethanol were also observed. Mice that received both ethanol andC. albicanswere the only group with significantly reduced locomotion in the OFT.C. albicans-colonized mice that received multiple injections with ethanol showed significantly shorter time to LORR onset thanC. albicans-colonized mice that received one injection. Ethanol also affects the BBB through changes in integrity and permeability (47,48). Inflammatory molecules such as LPS can also synergistically increase BBB permeability (49). The effects of ethanol on the BBB may thus synergize with the effects of PGE2, resulting in significant behavioral effects in colonized mice. Saccharin preference may not be reduced byC. albicanscolonization because of the lack of an additional insult to the BBB. All of the experiments described in this communication were done with ethanol naïve mice. The effects ofC. albicanscolonization on mice chronically exposed to ethanol are currently unknown. There could be an altered effect ofC. albicans-colonization on the host in the setting of AUD and/or chronic stress. Low DRD2 receptor abundance has been shown in individuals with AUD and predisposes mice to stress-induced increases in ethanol consumption (57,58). If DRD2 receptor abundance is reduced in humans withC. albicanscolonization, as it is in colonized mice, these individuals may consume more ethanol under stress, possibly exacerbating ethanol consumption in AUD. However, our study focused only on initial alcohol consumption and these effects ofC. albicanscolonization in individuals with AUD and/or chronic stress are currently unstudied. This remains an area of important future research. In summary, we have shown that GI colonization byC. albicanselevates serum PGE2and these changes correlate with changes inEpandDrdreceptor expression in the dorsal striatum.C. albicanscolonization decreased ethanol consumption and preference in C57BL/6 mice. These decreases in ethanol consumption correlated with changes in dopamine receptor expression andC. albicans-colonized mice showed altered behavioral effects of ethanol. In conclusion, we show for the first time, that changes in the fungal microbiome can impact host ethanol consumption and behavioral responses to ethanol. Five-week-old female or male C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Laboratory) were acclimated to the facility and single-housing for 4–5 days with scruffing to acclimate to handling. Mice were orally inoculated withC. albicansat different times depending on the experiment. Mice were inoculated by pipetting 20uL containing 5×107cells ofC. albicansstrain CKY101(59) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), or PBS only for mock-colonized mice, directly into the mouth of the mouse as previously described (25). Mock-colonized mice were given 20uL of PBS directly into their mouths. Mice were monitored throughout the experiment for colonization as previously described (25). No fungal colonies were observed in mock-colonized mice. Mouse weight was measured throughout the experiment. Rarely, if a mouse lost 20% of its starting body weight, the mouse was euthanized. On the last day of each experiment, mice were anesthetized using the isoflurane drop method and euthanized via decapitation. Blood for serum and various organs were harvested for analysis. All mouse experiments were approved by the Tufts IACUC and were performed in accordance with IACUC guidelines for care and use of laboratory animals. The EP1 antagonist SC-51089 (Cayman Chemical) and the EP2 antagonist TG6–10-1 (Cayman Chemical) were resuspended in 2:3:5 mixture of DMSO:sterile water:PEG400. Antagonists were resuspended and mixed at a concentration that would yield 2mg/kg of each antagonist in 50uL and 50 uL of the mixture was injected intraperitoneally. Fifteen percent ethanol was prepared for consumption by diluting 95% ethanol (Fisher) with tap water. This solution was filter sterilized and added to sipper tubes for the two-bottle choice experiment. 16,16-dimethyl Prostaglandin E2(Cayman Chemical) was dried under a gentle stream of nitrogen to evaporate the solvent. It was then resuspended in DMSO and injected into mice subcutaneously at a concentration of 25, 50, 100, or 300 ug/kg. Two-Bottle Choice Ethanol or Saccharin Consumption During acclimation to the facility and single housing, mice also began acclimating to the sipper tubes used in the two-bottle choice experiment. Briefly, sterile acidified water was poured into 50 mL conical tubes (USA Scientific) and a sterile stopper (#6 Rubber, Ancare) with a sipper spout (Ancare) was placed into the 50 mL conical tube and wrapped with parafilm. Two of these sipper bottles with water were placed into standard cages for acclimation. Following acclimation, mice were weighed and assigned to groups with equal weights. Mice were inoculated withC. albicansor mock-inoculated on day −1. On day 0, 15% (vol/vol) ethanol or 0.0125% (wt/vol) saccharin replaced one water bottle. Mouse weight and tube weight were then measured daily throughout the experiment. Sipper bottles were rotated daily to minimize side preference. After 2–4 days of ethanol consumption, mice were euthanized as previously described. Trunk blood from mice was obtained after decapitation, collected in BD blood collection tubes (365967, Fisher). Tubes were then centrifuged in an Eppendorf table-top microcentrifuge at 10,000g for 10 minutes and serum was stored at −80°C. Serum was assayed with a Prostaglandin E Metabolite ELISA Kit (514531, Cayman) after removal of proteins by acetone precipitation. PGE-m ELISA was performed using the standard protocol, with derivatization, detailed in the product manual. Serum was diluted 15–25 times for the assay and OD was measured on a Biotek Epoch2 plate reader. A four parameter logistic curve was determined and raw PGE-m values were determined using the 4PL calculator by AAT Bioquest (60). Brain Dissection, RT-qPCR, and Primers Mouse brains were dissected, flash frozen on aluminum foil chilled with dry ice and kept at −80°C. A brain matrix (ZIVIC Instruments, 5325) was allowed to chill on ice for 30 minutes. 2 mm sections of the brain from directly anterior of the cerebellum to the frontal pole were then cut using clean straight razor blades and the brain matrix. Sections were then observed to find landmarks indicating the location of the dorsal striatum as previously described (61). The dorsal striatum was dissected and RNA was extracted as previously described (25). cDNA was then synthesized using random hexamer primers and RT-qPCR was performed as previously described (25). Primer sequences are listed inSupplemental Table S1. Ethanol-Induced Conditioned Taste Aversion Following arrival, mice were acclimated to single-housing and sipper tubes by placing one sipper tube of water in their cages. Mice were weighed every other day to ensure they were consuming enough water to maintain their weight. The following protocol was adapted from a previous protocol that showed significant conditioned taste aversion in C57BL/6 mice (62). The first four days mice were acclimated to sipper tubes and single housing. Then, mice were subjected to 5 days of water restriction with only two hours of access to water for two hours daily (termed days 1–5 of the experiment). On day 5 of water restriction, mice were inoculated withC. albicansor PBS for mock-colonization and were re-inoculated every two days (days 5,7,9,11). On day 6, mice were given access to 1.2% saline for 1 hour in their home cages and injected with sterile saline, 2g/kg of ethanol, or 3g/kg of ethanol (20% vol/vol) immediately after the end of the 1-hour period. Five hours later, mice were given access to water for 30 minutes to rehydrate. This process was repeated for days 8 and 10; on day 12, mice were given access to 1.2% saline for 1 hour in their home cages and then euthanized. Fecal pellets were collected for CFU determination on days 6, 8, 10, and cecum contents were collected on day 12. Data were analyzed as a percentage of saline consumption compared to the initial amount consumed on day 6. On the open field test (OFT) habituation day, mice were injected an average of 15 minutes before their respective trials with 100uL of sterile saline intraperitoneally with an insulin syringe. Following 15 minutes, mice were gently placed in the center of a 37cm × 37cm plastic open field box. Mice were allowed to roam freely for 10 minutes and removed from the apparatus. The apparatus was then sterilized using 70% ethanol. This protocol was repeated for every mouse. On OFT test day, mice were injected with 1.5g/kg of ethanol or sterile saline intraperitoneally an average of 15 minutes before their trials. The volume of injection varied from approximately 90–110uL depending on the weight of the mouse. The ethanol concentration was adjusted so that a mouse of average weight for the group would be injected with 100uL ethanol solution. The 10-minute test run and cleaning of the apparatus were repeated as above for every mouse. Mouse behavior was recorded using a web camera. Scoring videos was performed using EthovisionXT software to automatically determine distance traveled. Total distance traveled was plotted relative to the mean of the sterile saline group distance traveled. A balance beam apparatus was constructed using a square 0.25-inch diameter, 3-foot-long metal rod held approximately 1.5ft above the surface. A plastic box to hold bedding was affixed to one end to provide incentive for the mouse to cross the entirety of the balance beam. A reading lamp shining on the start zone of the beam was used as an aversive stimulus. Start and end points for the balance beam trials spanning 65 cm of the beam were marked. On habituation day, mice were injected with 100uL of sterile saline intraperitoneally approximately 15 minutes before the start of their first of 3 trials. Mice were then placed in the start zone to begin trial 1. After completing the trial, mice were given 30 seconds of rest in their home cage before the start of trial 2. Trials 2 and 3 were performed by the same procedure. After a mouse completed 3 trials, the balance beam was cleaned using 70% ethanol and the next mouse was tested. In the event that a mouse would freeze, or very rarely fall, they would be gently prodded or placed back on the bar until they completed the trial. All mice within a cohort underwent this procedure. On test day, mice were injected with 100uL of sterile saline or injected with 1.5g/kg of ethanol as described in theopen field activity testsection. These injections were performed approximately 15 minutes before the start of the first trial. A web camera was used to record mouse behavior during these trials. The 3 trials were repeated as described above. All mice completed the entirety of the 3 trials. Videos were blinded for scoring. Start and stop times were determined when the mouse’s nose crossed designated marks on the bar. A slip was determined when a mouse’s foot slipped below the bar or a significant slip from a standing position on the bar to the pelvis touching the bar occurred. A fall was scored when the mouse slipped to the underside of the bar. Very rarely a mouse would fall from the bar into safety padding below the bar. Both of these events were scored equally as falls. Time or slips and falls were summed for all 3 trials for each mouse. Mice were co-housed with another mouse within the same group for the LORR. Their nestlet was removed for the test. Mice were injected with 3.5g/kg of ethanol intraperitoneally and the time of injection was recorded. Within roughly 1–2 minutes most mice lost righting reflex which was defined as an inability to right themselves when lying on their back in a V-shaped plastic trough. The time when a mouse lost righting reflex was designated the LORR onset. Six minutes after injection, mice were given one minute of exposure to isoflurane via the drop method and euthanized as above. Occasionally, a mouse would have to be removed from the data due to shearing of an artery during injection—significantly altering LORR time. Blood Ethanol Concentration Assay Following LORR, trunk blood was collected and serum was extracted as previously described in thePGE-m ELISAsection. For the blood ethanol concentration determination, an EnzyChrom Ethanol Assay Kit (ECET-100, BioAssay Systems) was used. Standard protocols were followed for the determination using serum that was diluted 15X. OD was measured on a Biotek Epoch2 plate reader.
