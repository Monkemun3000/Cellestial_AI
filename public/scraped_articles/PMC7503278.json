Cytoplasmic calcium ([Ca2+]cyt) is a well-characterized second messenger in eukaryotic cells. An elevation in [Ca2+]cytlevels is one of the earliest responses in plant cells after exposure to a range of environmental stimuli. Advances in understanding the role of [Ca2+]cytin plant development has been facilitated by the use of genetically-encoded reporters such as GCaMP. Most of these studies have relied on promoters such asCauliflower Mosaic Virus(35S) andUbiquitin10(UBQ10) to drive expression ofGCaMPin all cell/tissue types. Plant organs such as roots consist of various cell types that likely exhibit unique [Ca2+]cytresponses to exogenous and endogenous signals. However, few studies have addressed this question. Here, we introduce a set ofArabidopsis thalianalines expressingGCaMP3in five root cell types including the columella, endodermis, cortex, epidermis, and trichoblasts. We found similarities and differences in the [Ca2+]cytsignature among these root cell types when exposed to adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP), glutamate, aluminum, and salt, which are known to trigger [Ca2+]cytincreases in root cells. These cell type-targeted GCaMP3 lines provide a new resource that should enable more in depth studies that address how a particular environmental stimulus is linked to specific root developmental pathways via [Ca2+]cyt. Calcium (Ca2+) plays a vital role as a second messenger system in plant development and stress response. Because Ca2+acts as a stress signal, it is one of the first responses plants have to environmental stimuli. This fast response is achieved through an influx of extracellular Ca2+and an efflux of stored Ca2+from the vacuole, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and mitochondria that is achieved via a concentration gradient between the intracellular Ca2+stores and the cytoplasm [1]. In non-stimulated conditions, the concentration of Ca2+in the cytoplasm rests around 100 nM [1,2,3]. This low concentration is maintained through H+/Ca2+antiporters and Ca2+-ATPases that move Ca2+into the apoplast or into intracellular stores [3,4]. Once the response in the cell is initiated, the cell will return to homeostasis by storing excess Ca2+back in the vacuole, ER, or mitochondria through active transport [2], or by pumping it out into extracellular space through gated-ion channels in the plasma membrane. Once Ca2+enters the cytoplasm in high concentrations, it binds with Ca2+-binding proteins to initiate a second messenger cascade [4,5]. Part of this signaling cascade is the activation of Ca2+-dependent protein kinases and the regulation of transcription factors to increase tolerance to the stress that caused the initial Ca2+response. Much of our understanding about Ca2+as a second messenger has come from the development of technologies that enable monitoring of free cytosolic Ca2+([Ca2+]cyt) changes in living cells. Early on, these technologies consisted of indicator dyes that had to be chemically or physically loaded into the cell, such as Calcium Green or Indo-1. When Ca2+levels in the cell became elevated upon exposing the cell to a specific stimulus, these indicator dyes increased fluorescence [6]. However, use of these indicator dyes in plant cells were often met with technical challenges including uneven dye loading, loss of cell viability after dye loading, and cells failing to take up the dyes [6,7]. Problems with these early indicator dyes were mitigated with the discovery of a suite of fluorescent proteins from jellyfish and other marine organisms [8,9]. Using molecular cloning techniques, selected regions of Ca2+-binding proteins could be fused with these fluorescent proteins to generate genetically-encoded Ca2+sensors that change conformation upon Ca2+binding [8]. Ca2+binding induced changes in the conformation of fluorescent protein-based sensors result in enhanced fluorescence emission. One example of a genetically-encoded Ca2+sensor is GCaMP. GCaMP consists of an enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) fused to calmodulin (CaM) and myosin light-chain kinase (M13) [1,10]. GCaMP3 is a modified form of GCaMP that features a circularly permutated enhanced GFP (eGFP) flanked by CaM and M13 that gives low fluorescence in the absence of Ca2+, which increases upon reversible binding of Ca2+to the CaM domain [11]. To date, expression of CGaMP and other genetically-encoded Ca2+sensors in plants are driven by constitutive promoters such asCauliflower Mosaic Virus 35S (35S)andUbiquitin 10 (UBQ10)[12,13]. Although plant lines constitutively expressing genetically-encoded Ca2+sensors enabled the functional study of [Ca2+]cytchanges across entire plant organs [5,13,14], it is likely that each cell type within the organ is characterized by a unique [Ca2+]cytsignature. While [Ca2+]cytchanges typically observed in the entire plant organ likely originate from more than one cell type, we lack tools to monitor these changes within specific tissues or cells [15]. To address this need, we generated a set of lines in the model plantArabidopsis thaliana, expressingGCaMP3targeted to the columella, endodermis, epidermis, cortex, and trichoblast using cell-type specific promoters [16]. We demonstrate the utility of these new GCaMP3 lines in reporting cell-type [Ca2+]cytchanges in roots treated with chemicals previously shown to induce [Ca2+]cytincreases in plants. 2.1.

Chemical Treatments of Cell-Type Specific GCaMP3 Constructs Studies on Ca2+signaling in plants over several years have revealed various stimuli that can trigger a rapid elevation in [Ca2+]cytincluding cold, touch, wounding, hormones, reactive oxygen species, cyclic nucleotides, amino acids and nutrient/ionic stress [5,18,19,20,21,22,23]. We used some of these known [Ca2+]cyttriggers to test the responsiveness of our root cell-specific GCaMP3 lines. Time course of [Ca2+]cytchanges inA. thalianaroots after 1 mM ATP application.

Plotted values represent the average normalized fluorescence intensity from 3-4 ROI per line with standard error bars every fifth time point. Fluorescence values were normalized to the lowest fluorescence value. Some studies have shown [Ca2+]cytsignals propagate along the longitudinal axis of roots [5,26]. Meanwhile, another study has indicated that [Ca2+]cytsignal propagation from the apical into the sub-apical can also occur [27]. The cell type specific GCaMP3 lines described here, particularly those lines in whichGCaMP3is expressed in inner root cells such as the cortex-, endodermis- and columella-specific lines could shed new insights into the direction of [Ca2+]cytsignal propagation within the roots. The MS-induced [Ca2+]cytresponses in lines in whichGCaMP3was expressed in the endodermis and columella were not observed. However, these cell types exhibited [Ca2+]cytincreases in response to some of the chemicals, indicating that these [Ca2+]cytchanges can be attributed to the chemical itself. In this regard, it is noteworthy that columella-targeted GCaMP3 lines did not exhibit a [Ca2+]cytincrease after Al3+treatment while those lines withGCaMP3expressed in the endodermis lacked a [Ca2+]cytresponse to NaCl. With the establishment of response patterns from the cell type specific GCaMP3 lines when exposed to various chemical treatments, investigation into unique aspects of different root tissues/cells, such as signal propagation direction and response intensity, can be more readily explored. 4.1. Generation of Cell-Type Specific Promoter GCaMP Lines Each promoter was amplified from genomic DNA extracted from wild-typeArabidopsis thalianaseedlings using the Plant DNAzol Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) (Table S1). The sequence preceding the start codon for each gene was used in each instance. The resulting fragments were digested with PstI and SalI (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA;http://neb.com) and cloned into a modified pCAMBIA1390 vector [32].GCaMP3was amplified from plasmid DNA and digested with XmaI and BstEII (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA;http://neb.com) and then cloned behind each promoter construct in pCAMBIA1390. To generateUBQ10:GCaMP3, a similar approach was taken.GCaMP3was again amplified from plasmid DNA and then digested with EcoRI and SpeI (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA;http://neb.com) and cloned behind theUbiquitin 10promoter in a previously described pCAMIA1390 vector [33]. Plasmid containingGCaMP3was a gift from Loren Looger (Addgene plasmid # 22692;http://n2t.net/addgene:22692; RRID:Addgene_22692; [34]).Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation using the floral dip method was used to generate Arabidopsis ecotype Col-0 plants expressing the GCaMP3 constructs [35]. All primers used in this study are listed inTable S2. 4.2. Preparation of A. thaliana Seedlings for Imaging Seeds of the variousA. thalianaGCaMP3 lines were planted on coverslips coated with a thin layer of MS-supplemented low-melting agarose. This set-up was prepared by pouring 3 mL of autoclaved 0.5% low-melting agarose in 0.5X MS solution (pH 5.7) on 48 × 60 mm No. 1 coverslips (Thermo Scientific, gold seal cover glass reorder no. 3334, Waltham, MA, USA;www.thermoscientific.com) as described in Rincon-Zachary et al. (2010) [5]. Coverslips with polymerized agarose were placed in 9 cm diameter round Petri dishes and stored at 4 °C prior to planting seeds. In another set of experiments, seeds were planted as soon as the agarose polymerized. Petri dishes and coverslips with the planted seeds were kept in 4 °C for 2 days and transferred to a Conviron growth chamber (Controlled Environments Ltd., Winnipeg, MB, Canada) set to 24 °C with 14 h/10 h day/night cycle. Petri dishes with the coverslips were kept vertical to enable the roots to grow down and straight along the surface of the agarose. Seedlings were imaged when primary roots were about 3–4 cm long, which was 5–6 days after transfer to the Conviron. 4.3. Validation of GCaMP3 Expression in Root Cell Types Validation of GCaMP3 expression in the target root cell types was conducted with an inverted Leica TCS SP8-X Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany;http://leica-microsystems.com). Seedlings from the Conviron were secured in a horizontal orientation on the stage of the microscope. Seedling roots were illuminated with the 488 nm line of the Argon laser using a 40× (numerical aperture 1.1) water immersion objective and emitted light detected at 510 nm. For some lines, single optical images were acquired at a pixel resolution of 1024 × 1024. For other lines, a Z-series was acquired by capturing 81 images at 0.4 µm intervals and 3-D images were generated using the LAS visualization software of the Leica confocal microscope. 4.4. Chemical Treatments and Measurement of Ca2+-Dependent GCaMP3 Fluorescence Stock solutions of 1 M ATP (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA; A7699-1G), glutamate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA; G1149-100G), aluminum chloride (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA; Cas. No. 7784-13-6) and sodium chloride (J.T. Baker, Phillipsburg, NJ, USA; 3624-19) were made with deionized water and stored at 4 °C prior to use. Working solutions of 1 mM Al3+, 1 mM ATP, 1 mM Glu, and 150 mM NaCl were made by adding the appropriate volume of the stock solution in 0.5X MS at pH 5.7. Working solutions were made fresh prior to the imaging experiments. To measure [Ca2+]cyt-dependent GCaMP3 fluorescence, images of growing roots were acquired every 1 s for 10 to 15 min using the Leica SP8-X confocal microscope. Images were captured at a scanning speed of 600 MHz and pixel resolution of 512 × 300. Baseline GCaMP3 fluorescence of the roots was first acquired for 1 min after placing seedlings on the stage of the microscope. Twenty µL of the treatment solution was then added on top of the agarose medium where the root was growing using an adjustable volume pipette while imaging continued. From the collected images, the average fluorescence intensity was acquired by marking a rectangular region of interest corresponding to the specific cell type using the rectangular selection tool of the SPX-8 LAS software. GCaMP3 fluorescence (F) values were normalized using the formulaI=F−F0F0where F is the fluorescence intensity at some time point and F0 is the lowest fluorescence intensity point for the data set. Normalized fluorescence values were reported as the mean ± SE of at least three independent seedlings per GCaMP3 construct [36]. Another round of intensity video imaging was taken for the 0.5× MS control solution to generate the MS control fluorescence curves. All authors conceived and designed the research.
