Space radiation may pose a risk to skeletal health during subsequent aging. Irradiation acutely stimulates bone remodeling in mice, although the long-term influence of space radiation on bone-forming potential (osteoblastogenesis) and possible adaptive mechanisms are not well understood. We hypothesized that ionizing radiation impairs osteoblastogenesis in an ion-type specific manner, with low doses capable of modulating expression of redox-related genes. 16-weeks old, male, C57BL6/J mice were exposed to low linear-energy-transfer (LET) protons (150 MeV/n) or high-LET56Fe ions (600 MeV/n) using either low (5 or 10 cGy) or high (50 or 200 cGy) doses at NASA’s Space Radiation Lab. Five weeks or one year after irradiation, tissues were harvested and analyzed by microcomputed tomography for cancellous microarchitecture and cortical geometry. Marrow-derived, adherent cells were grown under osteoblastogenic culture conditions. Cell lysates were analyzed by RT-PCR during the proliferative or mineralizing phase of growth, and differentiation was analyzed by imaging mineralized nodules. As expected, a high dose (200 cGy), but not lower doses, of either56Fe or protons caused a loss of cancellous bone volume/total volume. Marrow cells produced mineralized nodules ex vivo regardless of radiation type or dose;56Fe (200 cGy) inhibited osteoblastogenesis by more than 90% (5 weeks and 1 year post-IR). After 5 weeks, irradiation (protons or56Fe) caused few changes in gene expression levels during osteoblastogenesis, although a high dose56Fe (200 cGy) increasedCatalaseandGadd45. The addition of exogenous superoxide dismutase (SOD) protected marrow-derived osteoprogenitors from the damaging effects of exposure to low-LET (137Cs γ) when irradiated in vitro, but had limited protective effects on high-LET56Fe-exposed cells. In sum, either protons or56Fe at a relatively high dose (200 cGy) caused persistent bone loss, whereas only high-LET56Fe increased redox-related gene expression, albeit to a limited extent, and inhibited osteoblastogenesis. Doses below 50 cGy did not elicit widespread responses in any parameter measured. We conclude that high-LET irradiation at 200 cGy impaired osteoblastogenesis and regulated steady-state gene expression of select redox-related genes during osteoblastogenesis, which may contribute to persistent bone loss. Structural degradation and oxidative stress following exposure to space radiation potentially endangers skeletal health of astronauts, both during the mission and later in life. Weightlessness-induced musculoskeletal atrophy, psychological stress, and confinement pose additional risks to astronaut health [1]. For exploration missions into deep space, galactic cosmic-rays (GCR) are of particular concern because of the high-energy and densely ionizing pattern of energy deposition from heavy ions [2,3,4], which can induce oxidative stress [5,6] in various tissues. Both solar particle-emissions (SPE) and GCR contribute to the mixed composition of low-energy radiation (such as protons and γ rays), high linear-energy-transfer (LET) particles (such as ionized56Fe- and12C-nuclei), and secondary constituents, such as Bremmstrahlung, fragmentation products, and neutrons [4,7]. Estimates of the total absorbed dose during a Mars mission (180-day transits with 500-day surface operations) to be between 28–47 cGy, with GCR contributing 27 cGy [8,9]. Currently, risk of exposure-induced death from a fatal cancer drives the NASA astronaut career radiation-exposure limit [10], though NASA is investigating additional risks associated with acute and late tissue degeneration following radiation exposure [11]. Irradiation perturbs the redox balance within the bone and marrow compartment in a complex and transient manner. Total-body irradiation (137Cs, 200 cGy) induces rapid reactive oxidative species formation in the marrow [12] and increases expression of the master transcription factor that binds to the antioxidant response element, nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2)[13]. Excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) can interfere with osteogenesis of bone marrow derived osteoprogenitors [14,15] as well as contribute to bone resorption by osteoclasts [16]. High-LET56Fe (≥200 cGy) impairs cell proliferation during osteoblastogenesis from marrow progenitors in a dose-dependent manner [17]. Further, irradiation in vitro with56Fe (100 cGy) arrests the cell cycle and inhibits proliferation of mesenchymal stem cells [18]. At higher doses (400–800 cGy), irradiation with X-rays increases ROS, depletes antioxidant stores, increases Nrf2 protein levels, and reduces differentiation in osteoblast-like cells [19]. However, the role of oxidative stress on the potential for total-body irradiation (TBI) to impair osteoblastogenesis over the long term, in particular low-dose, high-LET species, has not been fully characterized. We posed three principal questions to address in this study. First, are the severity of acute bone loss [12,13,20,21] and impairment of osteoblastogenesis [17] following TBI dependent on radiation type (LET) or dose? Secondly, which pathways are activated? Finally, do irradiation-induced insults to skeletal structure and osteoblastogenesis persist long after exposure? We hypothesized that: (1) irradiation induces bone loss, shown previously to be dominated by total dose of exposure [22], and leads to temporal perturbations in antioxidant defenses; (2) TBI induces both persistent changes in redox-related genes and cancellous microarchitecture in an ion-dependent manner; and, (3) addition of an antioxidant, here the enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD), mitigates irradiation-induced damage to osteoprogenitors and stem cells when exposed in vitro, implicating an oxidative-stress dependent mechanism. To address these questions, we conducted in vivo and in vitro experiments. For in vivo work, we selected protons and56Fe ions as representative radiation for the abundant low-LET particles in space radiation and the heavy-ion component of galactic cosmic radiation, respectively. For in vitro work, we selected137Cs γ rays as a low-LET reference radiation to enable high-throughput countermeasure testing. In vivo, there were persistent and profound decrements in mineralized nodules after TBI (at 200 cGy) with56Fe, while protons had a milder effect. In contrast to our hypothesis, few changes were observed in the steady-state expression of redox-related genes during ex vivo osteoblastogenesis following TBI, although there was some indication of altered expression of select genes during the proliferative phase (at 200 cGy56Fe, but not lower doses). Furthermore, scavenging ROS with an antioxidant (i.e., SOD) mitigated adverse effects of in vitro irradiation with γ rays, but failed to protect fully from irradiation with an equivalent dose of heavy ions. Total Body Irradiation (TBI) experiment designs. (A) Experiments to determine whether TBI alters antioxidant gene expression in osteoblasts, osteoblastogenesis, and the structure of cancellous bone in an ion-dependent fashion at five weeks after proton or56Fe exposure and to determine the osteoblastogenic and structural sequelae of56Fe irradiation one year after exposure. At each endpoint, marrow cells were cultured for osteoblastogenesis. At 5 weeks post-irradiation, osteoblastogenic cultures were halted during the proliferative phase and differentiation phase for gene expression assessment; (B) Experiment to determine the acute effect of proton or56Fe irradiation on the antioxidant status of the bone marrow extracellular fluid (ECF). Mice were irradiated and euthanized either one or seven days after exposure. Marrow was collected and cells removed through centrifugation. The supernatant, defined as the extracellular fluid (ECF), was assessed for total antioxidant capacity. 2.2.

Ex Vivo Osteoblastogenesis To assess the cellular responses to irradiation during ex vivo osteoblast growth and maturation, we cultured marrow progenitor cells at the 5 week and 1 year post-irradiation endpoints. For cultures plated 5 weeks post-irradiation, gene expression, alkaline phosphatase activity, colony counts, and DNA content analyses were performed during the proliferative phase (seven days after plating) and mineralization phase (19 to 21 days after plating). At the end of the latter phase, the mineralized area was quantified to assess the functional outcome of differentiation. List of genes quantified from ex vivo culture, which did not show significant changes in expression levels. Cells were isolated and cultured five weeks post-irradiation and analyzed at proliferative and terminally differentiated stages in growth. 2.5.

In vitro irradiation studies were conducted to further assess the role of oxidative stress in radiation damage to osteoprogenitors. Our approach was to test antioxidants and their capacity to rescue radiation effects to provide insight into the different mechanisms between low-LET radiation and high-LET radiation [31]. Although similar doses of low-LET radiation are generally less deleterious than high-LET radiation, the mechanisms for radiation damage to primary, marrow-derived osteoprogenitors in the context of oxidative stress are not fully elucidated [49,50,51]. When comparing the effects of low-LET radiation (137Cs) and high-LET radiation (56Fe), we found high-LET irradiation was more damaging with respect to growth of the cell population, as assessed by a surrogate assay (changes in DNA content over time). Furthermore, exogenous SOD effectively protected osteoprogenitors from low-LET radiation damage, but only minimally from56Fe at 100 cGy, and not at all from56Fe at 200 cGy. Taken together, these findings indicate excess extracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) inhibited growth, and that oxidative stress is possibly the main mechanism involved in low-LET radiodamage to osteoprogenitors; in contrast, high-LET species likely affect the cells via additional detrimental mechanisms, such as double-strand DNA breaks. Although others [52,53] have shown the beneficial effects of various antioxidants to confer radioprotection for various osteoblast cell lines, we show here a direct comparison of antioxidant treatment with different radiation species when added to primary, marrow-derived osteoprogenitors. Interestingly, adding SOD at higher doses or for longer periods was not advantageous, emphasizing the importance of carefully titrating radical scavengers such as SOD, possibly to maintain endogenous ROS-dependent signalling. Inherent limitations of these experiments with respect to radiation exposures include: (1) exposures were delivered at high dose-rate and fluence in a matter of minutes, whereas in space, the same dose is delivered at a lower rate, and (2) space exposures are mixed doses, rather than a single species (e.g., SPE can deliver 100–200 cGy over days and GCR over years). In addition, with respect to relevance to spaceflight, these experiments were performed in mice that were normally ambulatory, thus not subjected to musculoskeletal disuse and fluid shifts, which are induced by microgravity; groundbased models for spaceflight have shown that unloading can influence radiosensitivity [17,24,54,55]. In summary, our findings indicate that although low doses of radiation do not show lasting effects on skeletal health, a high dose of high-LET56Fe impairs osteoblast growth and maturation by adversely affecting growth of osteoprogenitors. There were few, select changes in steady-state expression of redox-related genes during osteoblastogenesis ex vivo after total body irradiation with56Fe (but not protons), with some indication of altered expression of select genes during the proliferative phase. Furthermore, scavenging ROS with antioxidants, such as SOD, mitigated the adverse effects of in vitro irradiation with γ rays (200 cGy), but failed to protect from irradiation with an equivalent dose of heavy ions. Together, our findings indicate that high-dose radiation has a persistent effect to impair bone formation by adversely affecting growth, but not differentiation, of osteoprogenitors. Male C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) were individually housed under standard conditions and provided food (LabDiet 5001, Purina, St. Louis, MO, USA) and waterad libitumas described by [13]. As a general measure of animal health, we measured body mass weekly for the duration of the study. Additionally, we blindly scored coat color as black or grey at the one-year post-irradiation endpoint. Animals were euthanized by cardiac puncture while under isoflurane overdose followed by cervical dislocation. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees for NASA Ames Research Center (Protocol NAS-10-001-Y2, 17 February 2011) and Brookhaven National Laboratory (Protocol #431, 8 February 2011) approved all of the procedures. 4.2. In Vivo Experiment Design and Radiation Exposure 4.3. In Vitro Experiment Design and Radiation Exposure Osteoprogenitors were grown in vitro from the bone marrow of 16-week old, male C57Bl/6 mice, as previously described [17]. Cells were irradiated three days after plating (day 3) with either γ (137Cs, sham or 10–500 cGy, JL Shepherd Mark I) or56Fe (sham or 50–200 cGy, NSRL), and then grown until day 10. Cell behavior was assessed by measuring changes in DNA content between day three and day 10 (as a surrogate for cell growth) with the Cyquant assay as previously described [17]. For the SOD experiment, multiple doses were tested in preliminary experiments (100–600 U/mL of SOD or vehicle, for 2 or 3 days of treatment at different times). The protocol selected for more extensive dose-response experiments entailed the addition of SOD (200 U/mL), or vehicle (α-MEM) 2 h before irradiation (day 3), twice a day, through the 4th day after exposure to radiation. Experiments were repeated 2–3 times. Data were normalized to the sham-control. 4.4. Total Antioxidant Capacity We measured the antioxidant capacity of the extracellular fluid of the marrow (i.e., the marrow plasma) with a colorimetric assay based on the reduction potential of Cu2+to Cu1+as compared to Trolox equivalent standards (Oxford Biomedical, Oxford, MI, USA). In brief, we isolated marrow ex vivo, using 150 µL of sterile saline to flush the marrow from the tibial diaphysis, as described previously [56]. The solution was centrifuged and supernatant preserved as the extracellular fluid at −80 °C for further assessment. The BCA assay assessed the protein concentration of the extracellular fluid against albumin standards, which enabled the normalization of the antioxidant capacity by the protein concentration to account for changes in protein levels with treatment [56]. 4.5. Bone Microarchitecture and Geometry We assessed the bone volume and microarchitecture of the cancellous tissue in the proximal tibial metaphysis using microcomputed tomography (6.7 µm pixel size, 3500 ms integration time, 50 kV, Skyscan 1174; Bruker microCT, Kontich, Belgium) as described in [13]. For cancellous quantification, a 1.0-mm thick region located 0.24 mm distal to the proximal growth plate was semi-autonomously contoured to include cancellous tissue. We assessed changes in cancellous bone using the three-dimensional bone volume to total volume fraction (BV/TV, %), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th, mm), trabecular number (Tb.N, 1/mm), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th, mm), and trabecular separation (Tb.Sp, mm). We assessed the changes in cortical bone at the midshaft of the femur using bone volume and cortical thickness. All analyses follow conventional guidelines [57]. 4.6. Ex Vivo Osteoblastogenic Assays and qRT-PCR Analyses For osteoblastogenic culture, femur marrow was flushed using saline and treated with lysis buffer specific for red blood cells (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), centrifuged for ten minutes at 1000×g, and supernatant removed. Cells were then re-suspended and plated at 3.0 × 105cells/cm2in 6-well plates. Osteoblastogenic growth medium (alpha minimum essential medium with 15% FBS (Gibco, Gaithersburg, MD, USA), 1× anti-biotic/mycotic, 50 µg/mL ascorbic acid, 10 mM β-glycerophosphate) was replenished every 2–3 days. SYBR-based custom array to query changes in expression levels of key genes. For ALP and DNA analyses, cells were collected in a solution of Tris buffer containing Triton-X and MgCl2and stored at −80 °C. Quantification of ALP enzymatic activity and total DNA content was performed using Alkaline Phosphatase Activity Colorimetric Assay (Biovision, Mountain View, CA, USA) and CyQuant Cell Proliferation Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), respectively. Colony counts early in culture assessed the successful adherence and proliferation of colony forming units. Parameters defining a colony included having distinct region of radial colony growth and having more than 30 cells with a majority of cells having of morphological homogeneity. To quantify densely mineralizing area (i.e., the nodule area), we harvested cultures in the differentiation phase. First, we washed cultures with saline and scanned the plates at 300 dpi resolution. We quantified the percentage of well area having mineralizing nodules with Image J, using a custom algorithm to threshold the grayscale image. We report parametric data with mean and standard deviation (SD). For these data, to determine significant differences, a 1-way analysis of variance was used followed by Dunnett’s post-hoc test, which allowed for the comparison of respective radiation types and doses to the age-matched sham control (0 cGy). For non-parametric data (i.e., nodule area data, as values near zero display skew), we report the median with interquartile range. For these data, to determine significant differences, we used a Kruskal-Wallis test with a Steel post-hoc test, which allowed for the comparison of respective radiation types and doses to the age-matched, sham control (0 cGy). We assessed temporal (within subjects) treatment (between subjects) effects in body mass, and their interaction (i.e., time × treatment), using Repeated Measures ANOVA and Wilks’ Lamda test. Throughout, ap-value ≤ 0.05 was accepted as significant. We performed all analyses using JMP 13 (SAS).
