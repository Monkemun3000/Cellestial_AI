  "content": "Bone shaft bending strength index is unaffected by exercise and unloading in mice Correspondence, Ian J. Wallace, Department of Anthropology, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY 11794, USA. E:ian.wallace@stonybrook.edu Accepted 2014 Dec 23; Issue date 2015 Mar. Anthropologists frequently analyze the cross-sectional geometry of lower limb bone shafts to infer the physical activity levels of past humans from their skeletal remains (Ruff,2008). This strategy is based on the well-documented capacity of bone shafts to adjust their morphology in response to mechanical loading, particularly during the growing years (Lieberman et al.2001; McKay et al.2005; Weeks et al.2008). Of the geometric properties used to infer activity levels, the bending strength index is often considered the most informative (Ruff,1987; Brock & Ruff,1988; Larsen et al.1995; Holt,2003; Stock,2006; Lieverse et al.2011). The bending strength index can be calculated in two ways, as the ratio of shaft second moments of area in the anteroposterior plane to second moments of area in the mediolateral plane (Ix/Iy) and, more commonly, as the ratio of second moments of area about orthogonal principal axes (Imax/Imin). Shafts withIx/Iyvalues close to 1 are roughly circular, whereas shafts with values greater or < 1 are more elliptical. The same logic applies toImax/Imin, but this ratio is always ≥ 1. In anthropological analyses, individuals with elliptical shafts are inferred to have been more physically active, as doing a lot of walking and running will tend to stress one's lower limb bones in a particular direction (Cavanagh & LaFortune,1980; Munro et al.1987; Yang et al.2014), whereas individuals with circular shafts are inferred to have been more sedentary. All experimental procedures were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Stony Brook University. Female Hsd:ICR mice (n= 40) were acquired at 3 weeks old from Harlan Sprague Dawley (Indianapolis, ID, USA). As Hsd:ICR is an outbred stock (as opposed to an inbred strain), genetics was an uncontrolled variable. Mice from this particular stock were chosen for analysis because exercise-loading has previously been shown to have positive effects on their hindlimb bone structure (Kelly et al.2006). Animals were housed individually and maintained on a 12:12 h light:dark cycle with free access to food and water. At 4 weeks old, animals were divided into runners and sedentary controls (n= 20/group). Groups were matched according to body mass. Runners were treated 5 days per week for 4 weeks with 30 min of exercise on a six-lane treadmill (Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH, USA) at a rate of 12 m min−1. At 8 weeks old, animals were killed, and right femora were extracted. Femora were scanned at a 10-μm3voxel size (70 kVp, 114 μA, 150-ms integration time) using a μCT 40 scanner (Scanco Medical AG, Brüttisellen, Switzerland). The volume of interest was a 600-μm-long region of the mid-shaft. Volumes were segmented using a constrained 3D Gaussian filter to reduce noise (support = 1, sigma = 0.1) and thresholded to extract the bone phase using a single threshold value for all bones.ImaxandIminwere computed using the internal imaging code supplied by the scanner manufacturer. These properties were chosen to calculate the bending strength index, rather thanIxandIy, as they are based on the intrinsic distribution of bone in the shaft and thus provide a better measure of shape (Shaw & Stock,2009). Values were sized-standardized by the product of body mass and bone length, as recommended when analyzing shaft second moments of area in weight-bearing elements (Ruff et al.1993; Ruff,2008). Female F2 mice (n= 29) were bred from a double-cross of female BAL/cByJ and male C3H/HeJ progenitors purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). Hindlimb unloading has previously been shown to have a catabolic effect on bone structure in these mice (Judex et al.2004,2013). Again, as these mice are genetically heterogeneous, genetics was an uncontrolled variable. Animals were housed individually and kept on a 12:12 h light:dark cycle with food and water freely available. At 16 weeks old, animals were assigned to an unloading group (n= 14) or control group (n= 15), which were also matched by body mass. Hindlimb unloading was induced for 4 weeks by hindlimb elevation through tail suspension (Morey-Holton & Globus,2002). Briefly, cloth tape was applied to the tail and secured to a cable system connected to a swivel mounted at the top of the cage, which allowed 360° free rotation. The elevation of the cable was adjusted to maintain the animal at roughly 30° head-down tilt, such that its forelimbs contacted the cage floor but its hindlimbs were freed from weight-bearing. Animals were kept in a suspended position 24 h day−1, but could access food and water with their forelimbs. Mice in the control group engaged in normal weight-bearing cage activities. Immediately prior to and after unloading, all animals underwentin vivoμCT scanning (VivaCT 75, Scanco Medical AG) to track longitudinal changes in shaft structure in the right femur. A 600-μm-long mid-shaft volume was scannedin vivoat a 20.5 μm3voxel size (45 kVp, 177 μA, 200-ms integration time). During scanning, mice were sedated by inhalation anesthesia with isoflurane. μCT image processing followed the same protocol as in the first experiment. Independent samplest-tests were performed to test for differences in traits between animals treated with treadmill exercise and sedentary controls. In the unloading and control groups, paired samplest-tests were used to assess change in bone properties over the experimental period. To test for treatment effects between the unloading and control groups,ancovas were carried out with post-treatment values as dependent variables and baseline values as the covariate (Vickers,2001). Analyses were performed in R software (R Core Development Team,2014). The significance level wasP< 0.05, and tests were two-tailed. Descriptive statistics are provided inTables S1andS2. Treatment with treadmill exercise resulted in significantly greater femoral mid-shaftImax(P= 0.004) andImin(P= 0.005) compared with sedentary controls (Fig.1). However, exercise did not significantly alter theImax/Iminbending strength index (P= 0.74), indicating that the simulated high-activity lifestyle did not lead to more elliptically shaped femoral mid-shafts. Relative difference in femoral mid-shaft traits between controls and exercised animals. Bars equal the percent difference between the exercise mean relative to the control mean. Whiskers equal the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the relative difference. Asterisks indicate statistically significant (P< 0.05) differences between groups. In control animals, femoral mid-shaftImaxandIminboth increased significantly (P< 0.0001) over the course of the experimental period (Fig.2). By contrast, in animals subjected to hindlimb unloading, little change occurred in eitherImax(P= 0.34) orImin(P= 0.40). Stunted normal bone growth in the unloading group ultimately led to significantly (P< 0.0001) diminished femoral mid-shaftImaxandImincompared with controls. During the experiment, theImax/Iminbending strength index decreased significantly and roughly equally in the control (P= 0.007) and unloading groups (P= 0.002), such that the simulated low-activity lifestyle did not result in greater femoral mid-shaft circularity compared with normal activity (P= 0.64). Longitudinal change in femoral mid-shaft traits in controls and animals treated with hindlimb unloading. Bars equal mean percent change relative to baseline values, and whiskers equal the standard deviation. Single asterisks indicate statistically significant (P< 0.05) longitudinal change within groups during the experiment. Double asterisks indicate significant differences between groups at the end of the experiment, determined by statistical analyses that controlled for baseline variation. What evidence exists then for the link between physical activity level and the bone shaft bending strength index that is assumed in many anthropological analyses of human skeletal remains? Two types of indirect evidence are frequently cited. First, differences in the shaft bending strength index have been observed among living human populations with distinct activity patterns. For example, Shaw & Stock (2009) analyzed tibial mid-shaft shape among university cross-country runners, field hockey players and non-athletic controls, and found that, relative to both hockey players and controls, runners exhibited more elliptical shafts, primarily due to enhanced bending rigidity in the anteroposterior plane. The authors speculated that the elliptical shape of the runners' shafts was caused by the repetitive anteroposterior tibial loading that characterizes their training regimen, although this could not be demonstrated conclusively as this was a cross-sectional study and not a longitudinal study. Second, in anthropological studies of humans living in the past, changes in archaeological measures of settlement patterns that are concomitant with changes in the bone shaft bending strength index may suggest a connection between physical activity level and shaft shape. For example, Holt (2003) has shown that during the European Upper Paleolithic, femoral shafts became more circular at roughly the same time that changes in the archaeological record point to increasing population density and sedentism. Of these two types of indirect evidence, we find the former to be somewhat more persuasive as the activity patterns of living groups are actually known, while those of ancient populations are not. The authors declare no conflict of interest. I.J.W., S.G., J.S., B.D. and S.J. conceived, designed and performed the experiments; I.J.W., S.G. and J.S. analyzed the data; I.J.W. wrote the paper.
