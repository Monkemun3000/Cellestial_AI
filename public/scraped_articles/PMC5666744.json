Increased oxidative stress is an unavoidable consequence of exposure to the space environment. Our previous studies showed that mice exposed to space for 13.5 days had decreased glutathione levels, suggesting impairments in oxidative defense. Here we performed unbiased, unsupervised and integrated multi-‘omic analyses of metabolomic and transcriptomic datasets from mice flown aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis. Enrichment analyses of metabolite and gene sets showed significant changes in osmolyte concentrations and pathways related to glycerophospholipid and sphingolipid metabolism, likely consequences of relative dehydration of the spaceflight mice. However, we also found increased enrichment of aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis and purine metabolic pathways, concomitant with enrichment of genes associated with autophagy and the ubiquitin-proteasome. When taken together with a downregulation in nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2-mediated signaling, our analyses suggest that decreased hepatic oxidative defense may lead to aberrant tRNA post-translational processing, induction of degradation programs and senescence-associated mitochondrial dysfunction in response to the spaceflight environment. Long-duration spaceflight is associated with significant risks including prolonged exposure to microgravity, continuous exposure to low-dose/low-dose rate radiation, psychological and environmental stress and contact with potentially dangerous levels of microbial contamination [1,2,3,4,5]. Radiation is known to induce single (SSB) and double strand (DSB) DNA breaks, permanently damaging nuclear and mitochondrial DNA and leading to early apoptosis or necrosis [6,7,8]. At low-dose/low-dose rates, radiation immediately triggers oxidative stress via a spike in the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Acute psychological stress increases hepatic lipid peroxidation as well as levels of ROS [9], however chronically stressed animals compensate [9,10]. Therefore, exposure to the space environment, characterized by changes in physiological and psychological stress, as well as exposure to low-dose/low-dose rate radiation, may systemically alter ROS levels in a complex fashion [11,12,13]. Excessive ROS production, without a corresponding upregulation in antioxidant or ROS scavenger pathways, can cause damage to cellular components including DNA, proteins and lipids, inducing pro-inflammatory cytokines and the nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) pathway [14]. This can lead to cell cycle arrest, activation of senescence or apoptosis and upregulation of inflammatory signaling molecules, causing widespread organelle, cell and tissue damage [15]. Under conditions of chronic exposure to oxidative stress (such as in spaceflight), an imbalance occurs between ROS production and antioxidant quenching resulting in increased cellular and tissue damage [16,17,18]. Mitochondria are particularly vulnerable to damage by excess ROS and we hypothesized that the liver, a mitochondria-rich metabolic organ, may be a target of spaceflight-induced deficits. In support of this hypothesis, astronauts were shown to exhibit a mild diabetogenic phenotype following spaceflight, the severity of which was linked with flight duration [19,20]. We previously demonstrated that mice flown aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis (Space Transportation System (STS)-135) for 13.5 days exhibited a significantly impaired response to oxidative stress evidenced by decreased hepatic levels of the antioxidant glutathione (GSH, reduced), with concomitant increased ophthalmate, a biomarker for depletion of glutathione, and increased ratio of glutathione disulfide (GSSG):GSH [21]. Other spaceflight-induced changes in hepatic genes linked to oxidative defense have also been observed [13]. Our targeted analyses of metabolomics and transcriptomics datasets obtained from livers of spaceflight mice showed dysregulation of pathways involved in both lipid metabolism and the immune response, with signs of retinoid export and activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) pathways suggestive of nascent hepatic fat accretion and collagen deposition. Proteomics data acquired from mice exposed to space for 30 days exhibited similar patterns when compared with mice re-acclimated to ground conditions [22]. Our previous integrated data analysis utilized a limited set of genes and metabolites that were elevated in abundance in spaceflight mice as compared with ground controls and were tightly correlated with histological evidence of increased hepatic lipid accumulation. The goal of the present study was to perform unbiased, integrated analyses using the entire metabolomics and transcriptomics datasets to determine whether additional insights into the effects of exposure to the space environment on liver metabolism and cellular function could be gleaned. Utilizing several enrichment algorithms, we determined that degradation and senescence programs were altered in spaceflight mice in concert with attenuation of oxidative defense networks. 2.1.

FC–fold change comparing FLT to AEM controls.n= 6/group. 2.2. Altered Betaine and Glutathione Metabolism Are Central Defects in Spaceflight Mouse Livers Metabolite set enrichment analysis reveals metabolic pathways enriched in livers of FLT mice. Enrichment analysis was performed in MetaboAnalyst using (A) all metabolites or (B) only metabolites with significantly changing abundances between groups (p< 0.05).n= 5/group. Eighty-eight metabolite sets based on “normal metabolic pathways” were used for the analysis. For clarity of presentation, only the most significantly enriched metabolite sets are annotated. We next identified specific metabolites that were contributing to the enrichment scores. Theglycine, serine and threonine metabolismenrichment score was based on decrease of cystathionine and increase of betaine and dimethylglycine. Eight other metabolites contributed to the enrichment, however their abundance changes were not significant between groups. Theglutathione metabolismenrichment score was based on decreased abundance of glutathione and cysteinylglycine in FLT mice as compared with AEM controls, with additional contributions from four non-significantly changing metabolites.Fatty acid oxidationenrichment scores (bothbranched chainandvery long chain) were based on abundance of propionylcarnitine and carnitine, with coenzyme A and acetyl carnitine contributing to the score as well. It should be noted that MetaboAnalyst does not recognize many lipids, therefore lipid metabolic pathways are likely under-represented. Contributors to enrichment ofmethionine metabolismwere similar to those ofbetaine metabolismand consisted primarily of betaine, dimethylglycine and choline, with additional contributions fromS-adenosylhomocysteine and 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid, suggesting activation of theS-adenosyl methionine (SAM) cycle in the FLT mice. Abundances of these metabolites in FLT mouse livers and AEM controls are summarized inTable S2. For validation, metabolite pathway analysis was performed and similar pathways were found to have a high impact score based on enrichment and topology analysis (Figure S2). We previously reported a significant increase in abundance of betaine in FLT livers [4,5]. Betaine is metabolized from choline, which decreased in FLT mice [4,5]. Betaine is also a methyl donor and provides the methyl group for metabolism of homocysteine to methionine, generating dimethylglycine as well. Furthermore, the transmethylation cycle provides substrates used for the synthesis of cystathionine and GSH via transsulferation [23]; labile methyl groups are required for these processes as well as support of folate metabolism and synthesis of methylated compounds. Since methionine is lost in the transmethylation pathway, it is possible that choline is supplied to preserve pathway function [24]. However, the observed increase in abundance of betaine with a concomitant decrease in cystathionine and GSH suggests increased choline metabolism in spaceflight is not linked to augmented activation of one carbon metabolic pathways, since abundance levels of relevant metabolites such asS-adenosylhomocysteine, serine, sarcosine and glycine are unchanged. Therefore, other mechanisms are likely involved. Increased steatosis and infiltration of inflammatory cells in livers from mice exposed to spaceflight. H&E staining was performed on fixed liver sections fromn= 4–5 mice/group to investigate liver histology. Inspection of the H&E stained sections revealed that the AEM ground control mice had small cytoplasmic lipid droplets predominantly located in zone 2 whereas the FLT mice had an increase in slightly larger droplets distributed in a panlobular pattern. Multiple lipid droplets are indicated using white arrows. Furthermore, FLT mice showed increased accumulation of mononuclear inflammatory cells, particularly near portal ducts (yellow arrow).

Autophagy-related programs are essential for liver regeneration [55] and repair and induction of autophagy may occur in response to exposure to the space environment. Several studies have characterized the molecular mechanisms involved in regeneration of the liver in response to a variety of stress conditions and in response to partial hepatectomy (PHx), whereby a significant portion of the rodent liver is removed and the remaining portion regenerates and restores the liver to its original size. This process is highly regulated and includes several distinct stages, including withdrawal of hepatocytes from quiescence, cell cycle entry and progression, cessation of cell division and return of hepatocytes to quiescence [56,57,58,59]. Although hepatocytes are the first cells to replicate, they are followed sequentially by other cell types within the liver including stellate cells and sinusoidal endothelial cells [59]. Animal studies were reviewed and approved by multiple Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUC) boards, including the NASA Ames Research Center ACUC (NAS-11-002-Y1; 31 May 2011), the NASA Kennedy Space Center (KSC) ACUC (FLT-11-078; 23 May 2011) and the University of Colorado at Boulder Institutional ACUC (1104.11; 10 May 2011). No protocol was required for assays performed at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Center or Loma Linda University since only tissues obtained after euthanasia (no live animals) were analyzed at our sites. All NASA studies involving vertebrate animals were carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. 3.1. Animals and Sample Collection Nine-week old weight-matched female C57BL/6J mice were selected for this study because they produce fewer odor annoyance issues and were the only gender approved for flight (n= 15/group). Additionally, all historical data (e.g., STS-118) were obtained on female mice so the use of female mice permitted comparisons across missions, particularly for the musculoskeletal studies that were primary. Mice were housed in Animal Enclosure Modules (AEMs, 10 mice per AEM habitat; 5 per side separated by a wire mesh) and either flown on the Space Shuttle Atlantis (STS-135) for 13.5 days (FLT) or housed at the Space Life Science Laboratory (SLSL) at KSC (Ground AEM controls; AEM). Following two days of acclimation after receipt, mice were provided a NASA NuRFB foodbar (TD 04197; 47% carbohydrate, 17.9% protein, 3.9% lipids, 2.8% fiber, 2.80 kcal/g). All mice were placed into AEM housing one day before flight. Environmental parameters for ground control mice were matched as closely as possible with flight conditions using 48 h delayed telemetry data. Conditions were controlled for temperature, humidity, and a 12/12 h light/dark cycle; foodbars and water were providedad libitum. Tissues were harvested at the SLSL within 3–5 h after return of the Space Shuttle Atlantis and were distributed amongst a team of investigations through NASA’s Biospecimen Sharing Program; we received one half lobe of liver from six mice per group. Mice were euthanized using 4% isoflurane followed by cardiac puncture and exsanguination. Liver lobes were extracted and dissected. A portion of the liver was prepared in 4% paraformaldehyde and the rest snap frozen in liquid nitrogen then shipped to either Loma Linda University or University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus and stored appropriately prior to use. Frozen liver pieces (n= 6/group) were shipped to Metabolon, Inc. (Morrisville, NC, USA) and stored at −80 °C before use. Samples were prepared for the appropriate instrument, either Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS) or Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS), as described previously [4,5]. Briefly, automated sample preparation was conducted to extract metabolites for analysis by LC and GC. Extracts were placed briefly on a TurboVap®(Zymark, Clackamas, OR, USA) to remove organic solvent. Each extract was then frozen and dried under vacuum. 3.4. Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS) Extracts were split into two aliquots, dried, then reconstituted in acidic or basic LC-compatible solvents, each of which contained 11 or more injection standards at fixed concentrations. Metabolite features were measured using a Waters ACQUITY UPLC (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) and a Thermo-Finnigan LTQ-FT MS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in two independent injections using separate dedicated columns as described previously [4,5]. One aliquot was analyzed in positive ion mode under acidic conditions and gradient eluted from a Waters BEH C182.1 mm × 100 mm column, containing 1.7 µm resin, using water and methanol as mobile phases with both containing 0.1% formic acid. The other aliquot was analyzed in negative ion mode using basic conditions, which also employed water/methanol, and contained 6.5 mM ammonium bicarbonate for ion pairing. Mass spectrometric analysis alternated between MS and data-dependent MS2scans using dynamic exclusion, scanning from 80–1000m/z. Accurate mass measurements were made on precursor ions with greater than 2 million counts; typical mass error was less than 5 ppm. 3.5. Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) Extracts destined for GC/MS were vacuum desiccated for 24 h then derivatized under dried nitrogen using bis(trimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA). Volatile metabolites were separated using 5% phenyl/95% dimethyl polysiloxane fused silica (20 m × 0.18 mm ID; 0.18 µm film thickness) and a temperature ramp from 40 to 300 °C within 16 min; helium was used as the carrier gas. Compounds were analyzed using a Thermo-Finnigan Trace DSQ fast-scanning single-quadrupole MS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with electron impact ionization set to scan from 50–750m/zat unit mass resolving power, as we previously described [4,5]. Transcriptomics and metabolomics data are publicly accessible via the NASA GeneLAB data base. Transcriptomics data are found at the website (Available online:https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-25/). Metabolomics data are available at the website (Available online:https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-108/). MetaboAnalyst software (Available online:www.metaboanalyst.ca) was used for pathway and enrichment analysis of metabolomics data as well as integrated analysis of transcriptomics and metabolomics datasets. Data were log-transformed and auto-scaled then subjected to various analytical modules within the software [64]. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) and Exploratory Gene Association Networks (EGAN) [42] (Available online: akt.ucsf.edu/EGAN) were used to assess pathway activation based on changes in mRNA expression levels. Human Metabolite Database (HMDB) accession numbers were queried and names of genes associated with metabolites exhibiting significant changes in abundance were extracted manually. These genes were used to construct a subset list of genes that may be functionally significant, based on metabolite abundance changes, and this subset was also subjected to pathway and enrichment analysis. Fixed tissue sections were processed for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining as described previously [65]. Histologic images were captured on an Olympus BX51 microscope equipped with a 4mp Macrofire digital camera (Optronics, Tokyo, Japan) using the PictureFrame Application 2.3 (Optronics). All images were cropped and assembled using Photoshop CS2 (Adobe Systems, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA). Data were analyzed with GraphPad Prism V6.0 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA) using a Mann-WhitneyU-test or unpairedt-test with Welch’s correction for comparison between groups. Means ± SEM were reported. The ROUT method withQ= 1% was used to identify outliers for exclusion from analysis.p (corr)-values less than 0.05 were selected to indicate significance. Michael J.
