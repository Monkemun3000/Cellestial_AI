As a species, we have been working and living in space for more than 60 years, with continuous occupation for the last 23 years via the International Space Station (ISS) [1]. During this time, we have discovered that spaceflight induces numerous physiologic alterations, including but not limited to muscle and bone loss, structural changes in the eyes and brain, altered cardiovascular function, and altered cognitive function [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]. In some cases, we have developed effective countermeasures for these undesirable outcomes, but in other cases, understanding and countering the causes of these outcomes remain active areas of investigation. For example, adequate exercise and nutrition are sufficient to limit bone and muscle loss in astronauts onboard the ISS [10]. In contrast, causes of and countermeasures for alterations in the brain remain active areas of research [11]. As research advances, it has become increasingly clear that there are some molecular hallmarks of spaceflight [12], which include mitochondrial dysregulation, oxidative stress, DNA damage, and epigenetic changes. Current challenges of space life sciences research include linking these molecular alterations to the physiologic ones as well as to the known spaceflight hazards. These hazards include distance from Earth, confinement, being in a hostile and closed environment, altered gravity, and increased and altered radiation exposure [12,13,14]. With our increased presence in space, our ability to conduct space medicine continues to improve. For example, we now understand that improved skin care is needed in flight due to the frequency of skin rashes [15]. Currently, there is an increased interest in personalized approaches for optimizing astronaut health [16,17,18,19,20]. For example, exercise and nutrition can be individually tailored to prevent muscle loss in flight [10,21]. The success of these approaches on Earth, combined with the increased use of -omics data in terrestrial medicine, has also led to using -omics approaches in astronauts [17,21,22,23]. While still in its infancy [24,25,26], it seems clear that combining -omics data from space-flown model organisms, such asC. elegans,Drosophila, and rodents, with astronaut data can accelerate the discovery process, in part by compensating for the current rarity of human space -omics datasets [22,27]. For example,C. elegans, rodents, and humans all display alterations in insulin-linked gene expression in response to spaceflight [28]. Given the central role of insulin in human health and longevity on Earth [29], it is highly likely this system is equally important to maintain in space. Indeed, recent data from space-flown rodents confirm that the liver–muscle axis is central to regulating both global metabolic health and muscle health functions the same in space as on Earth and that its perturbation may contribute to both liver and muscle pathology in flight [30]. While our advances in fundamental space life sciences and space medicine have been substantial, these are largely limited to habitation in the Low Earth Orbit (LEO). With planned government and commercial missions beyond LEO (BLEO), understanding fundamental changes to biological systems and countermeasures to detrimental alterations at new destinations, such as the Moon and Mars, are emerging challenges [31]. For example, current exercise countermeasures for maintaining muscle on the ISS are not feasible on currently planned spacecraft due to size constraints [32]. Similarly, storing adequate nutrition further away from Earth is operationally challenging [33,34,35]. Thus, despite not being a current priority for research on the ISS, understanding molecular mechanisms underpinning muscle atrophy in space remains important for these new exploration class missions. Currently, designing space biology experiments for BLEO means that the experiments must be small and autonomous [36,37,38]. For example, using a CubeSat, such as Biosentinel [39], as a passive or mostly passive payload on Artemis [40], or an autonomous instrument on a Commercial Lunar Payload Services mission [41]. Thus, using standard flight genomic model organisms [27] that are small, such as bacteria, yeast,C. elegans, orDrosophila,is feasible. In terms of muscle strength, a microfluidic device has been developed for assessing strength inC. elegans[42], and this has been successfully used to both demonstrate decreased strength in mutants with defective muscle structure [43,44,45] and to identify drugs to improve strength both in muscle mutants [46] and with age [47]. Thus, the use ofC. elegansfor studying and countering muscle strength decline on the Moon is technically feasible, albeit challenging.

Fabrication and Assembly of a Microfluidic Device in Worm Loading Apparatus (WLA) Devices were fabricated and assembled in WLA as previously described [42,49]. The micropillar-based NemaFlex-S device was fabricated using a modified two-step soft lithography process [58]. The mold was fabricated in SU-8 2050 negative photoresist (Microchem) on a 4″ silicon wafer as a substrate. First, a 20 μm tall photoresist layer was fabricated, which forms the boundary of the NemaFlex chamber. Next, a second layer of 80 μm height was fabricated on top of the initial layer. The second layer was fabricated with cylindrical holes that form the micropillars. This two-layer approach provided chambers with a depth of approximately 100 μm containing deformable pillars of 80 μm height. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) devices of 4.25 ± 0.25 mm thickness were cast using Sylgard 184 part A (base) and part B (curing agent) 10:1 by weight (Dow Corning) over the SU-8 mold by curing for approximately 2 h at 70 ± 1 °C. Inlet, outlet, and air vent holes were cored with a 1 mm hole puncher (Acuderm, Fort Lauderdale, FL, USA). The devices were thoroughly cleaned with Scotch tape to remove dirt before bonding. The PDMS replica was then treated in an air-plasma cleaner (Harrick Plasma, Ithaca, NY, USA) for 90s and bonded to a 2 × 3 inch glass slide. Bonding was done, ensuring the pillars did not collapse or deform. The bonded devices were immediately placed in an oven for 10 min at 70 ± 1 °C. Devices were then treated with 5 wt% Pluronic F127 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 30 min to prevent any bacterial build-up and reduce bubble formation during worm loading. After incubation, excess Pluronic was removed by washing the devices with DI water. The treated devices were soaked in DI water overnight at 20 ± 1 °C to release any air bubbles from the devices. Fabrication of devices took place at TTU, with devices shipped to EVMS. The microfluidic chips were shipped in Ziploc bags with DI water. Fabrication of WLA took place at BioServe Space Technologies, with WLA shipped to EVMS. Assembly took place at EVMS and was conducted by BioServe Space Technologies (Boulder, CO, USA). 2.3. Image Acquisition and Processing 2.4. RNA Extraction, Sequencing and Data Pre-Processing RNA was extracted from frozen worm samples using Direct-zol RNA Miniprep kit (Zymo Research cat# R2050). Two to three independent biological replicates were prepared for each treatment. RNA concentration was determined using Nanodrop 2000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Library preparation and next-generation sequencing were subsequently performed by the Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI, Hong Kong), with strand-specific (second strand cDNA synthesis with dUTP) 100 bp paired-end reads generated using the DNBseq platform. Cleaned reads (reads with adaptor sequences, contamination, and low-quality reads removed via the SOAPnuke software version 2.1.8 developed by BGI [60]) obtained from BGI were deemed to be of good quality (no over-represented sequences or adapter sequences, and median per base quality scores always >30, as determined using FastQC; Babraham Bioinformatics) and transcript-level abundances consequently estimated via pseudo-alignment to theC. elegansreference transcriptome (Ensembl release 108) using Kallisto (version 0.48.0 [61]). Gene counts were then inferred via the tximport R package (version 1.28.0 [62]), and lowly expressed genes were filtered out (genes with a count <10 in every sample) to leave 13,897 genes for downstream analyses.

Genes Predicted to Be Altered in Space Are Predicted to Be Altered by Drugs on Earth Heatmap of chemical and biologic drug targets predicted to be significantly activated or inhibited for significantly upregulated (UR) and downregulated (DR) genes from thewtflight vs.wtground condition, highlighting the potential for alteration in therapeutic potential in the context of spaceflight-induced changes. Historically, space biology experiments have been constrained by mass, power, size, and crew time limitations [117]. Now, with a functional ISS, there is functional laboratory equipment, such as the microscope we employed in this study, and crew time for carrying out complex tasks, such as our experiment or extracting and sequencing DNA on ISS [118]. With these improved abilities to conduct science, we were able to extend past studies usingC. elegansin space to include capture not only of transcriptomic data [48] but to study physiology more comprehensively than simple movement analysis [49]. Using our NemaFlex-S, we were successfully able to measure worm strength both in flight and on the ground. Using these extended capabilities, we were able to test and confirm the hypothesis that worms, like people [119], are weaker in space. This demonstration extends our understanding of muscle response to spaceflight by demonstrating that not only are the molecular changes in muscle sarcomeric gene expression driven by altered MyoD expression conserved between worms and people [51], but so too are the functional consequences. These technical advances and increased knowledge may now be combined to test various nutrient and pharmaceutical interventions to improve muscle strength in flight, as we have recently been able to do for DMD and aging muscle on Earth [46,47]. This experiment presents an example of how near-simultaneous in-flight collection of -omics alongside phenotypic measures can enable insights into the potential molecular mechanisms behind spaceflight-associated physiological deconditioning [120]. Response of gene expression to spaceflight has gained increased interest in the past few years, principally due to the implementation of NASA’s GeneLab program [121]. This has even resulted in introducing network biology into scientific roadmaps, for example ESA’s Biology roadmap 9E [122]. At the simplest level, DEG analysis focuses on individual genes, while this may be useful, it ignores the power of big data, such as reproducibility [123] across experiments and systems and may be biased based upon differences in computational approach/pipeline [124]. For example, the gene identified as most downregulated in this study was previously identified as one of the most upregulated in the first unbiased whole genome response ofC. elegansto flight [77]. This difference could also be due to operational differences in the two missions. In contrast, our use of GO and network/module analysis has, once again [48], revealed a consistent and reproducible change in gene expression inC. elegansin response to spaceflight. A key finding of this study is that strength decreases in flight. As discussed above, declines in mitochondrial gene expression are repeatedly observed in response to spaceflight [48] and are a treatable cause of strength decline on Earth [46,47]. Therefore, testing of mitochondrial interventions to reverse strength decline in space is now required to determine if the correlation between strength and mitochondrial decline is causal or not. Additionally, as our gene annotation and computational skills improve, it is possible to obtain more knowledge from gene expression data than in the past. For example, our module analysis reveals that certain gene expression changes can be attributed to specific tissues (for example, cell adhesion in the hypodermis), whereas others are more universal (for example, mitochondrial stress). Further, our new analysis reveals that calcium metabolism in neurons is also a potential cause of strength decline in space, more specifically by altering acetylcholine signaling, again suggesting an interventional study is required to (dis)prove the casualty of this link. This suggestion, unsurprisingly, has also previously been made for human strength decline in flight [125,126]. This study extends the growing literature base solidifying the general molecular features underpinning spaceflight-related health decline. By directly linking neuromuscular strength loss with increased stress response and reduced mitochondrial/cytoskeletal gene pathways, we provide a robust framework in which to develop targeted therapeutics against a primary maladaptation to space habitation. Our informatic pipeline, combined with the use ofdys-1muscle weakness mutants, further highlights perturbed calcium handling and acetylcholine signaling within neurons as primary candidates causing impaired neuromuscular strength in space. These findings provide the foundations for, and an in vivo model of, space-induced strength loss to employ on near-term missions beyond low Earth orbit and to the Moon.
