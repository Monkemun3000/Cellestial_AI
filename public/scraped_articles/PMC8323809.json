  "content": "The rapid diagnosis and effective inhibition of coronavirus using spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles† Received 2020 Dec 1; Accepted 2021 Jan 18; Collection date 2021 Mar 23. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of the coronavirus disease that began in 2019 (COVID-19), has been responsible for 1.4 million deaths worldwide as of 13 November 2020. Because at the time of writing no vaccine is yet available, a rapid diagnostic assay is very urgently needed. Herein, we present the development of anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles for the rapid diagnosis of specific COVID-19 viral antigen or virusviaa simple colorimetric change observation within a 5 minute time period. For rapid and highly sensitive identification, surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) was employed using 4-aminothiophenol as a reporter molecule, which is attached to the gold nanoparticleviaan Au–S bond. In the presence of COVID-19 antigen or virus particles, owing to the antigen–antibody interaction, the gold nanoparticles undergo aggregation, changing color from pink to blue, which allows for the determination of the presence of antigen or virus very rapidly by the naked eye, even at concentrations of 1 nanogram (ng) per mL for COVID-19 antigen and 1000 virus particles per mL for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein pseudotyped baculovirus. Importantly, the aggregated gold nanoparticles form “hot spots” to provide very strong SERS signal enhancement from anti-spike antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticlesvialight–matter interactions. Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation data indicate a 4-orders-of-magnitude Raman enhancement in “hot spot” positions when gold nanoparticles form aggregates. Using a portable Raman analyzer, our reported data demonstrate that our antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticle-based SERS probe has the capability to detect COVID-19 antigen even at a concentration of 4 picograms (pg) per mL and virus at a concentration of 18 virus particles per mL within a 5 minute time period. Using HEK293T cells, which express angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), by which SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells, we show that anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles have the capability to inhibit infection by the virus. Our reported data show that antibody attached gold nanoparticles bind to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, thereby inhibiting the virus from binding to cell receptors, which stops virus infection and spread. It also has the capability to destroy the lipid membrane of the virus. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of the coronavirus disease that began in 2019 (COVID-19), has been responsible for 1.4 million deaths worldwide as of 13 November 2020. The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), also known as coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), is responsible for huge global disruption to health and economies.1–10As of 13 November 2020, more than 59.4 million people have suffered from COVID-19 disease and around 1.40 million have died worldwide1,2. It is now well documented that spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) are the important structural proteins for coronavirus particles.6–16Several reports indicate that spike protein plays the most important role for virus entry and disease pathogenesis.3–14Because at the time of writing there are no FDA-approved vaccines or therapeutics for the treatment of COVID-19 disease, rapid diagnosis is the key to slowing the spread of COVID-19 and saving lives.1–20Driven by the urgent need, we report the development of an anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticle (GNP) for rapid diagnosis of specific COVID-19 viral antigen (COVID-19 Spike Recombinant Antigen) or the virus itselfvianaked eye colorimetric change and highly sensitive surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). Recently, Venturaet al.reported highly sensitive COVID-19 detection by means of a colorimetric assay that employed GNPs to which three different (spike, envelope, and membrane) antibodies were attached.14In the current manuscript, we show that anti-spike antibody attached GNPs are capable of ultrasensitive identification as well as inhibition of virus particles. As we and others have reported before, owing to good biocompatibility, size dependent optical properties and ease of modification of the surface, gold nanoparticles can be used for the development of excellent biosensing platforms.17–33As shown in Fig. S1 and S2 in the ESI,†the color of our anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticle is pink and it changed to a bluish tinge in the presence of the COVID-19 antigen or virus owing to aggregationviaantigen–antibody interaction. As a result, we observed a color change upon aggregation. Based on color observation with the naked eye, we can detect COVID-19 antigen even at a concentration of 1 nanogram (ng) per mL and virus particles at a concentration of 1000 virus particles per mL. Since SARS-CoV-2 is a biosafety-level-3 (BSL-3) virus, we have used a BSL-2 SARS-CoV-2 spike protein pseudotyped baculovirus (pseudo SARS-CoV-2) as a model system for our diagnosis and inhibition experiments.36,37 Owing to its extremely high sensitivity, SERS can be used for detection of very low levels of viruses, bacteria, cancer cells and different biomolecules.17–27It is now well documented that Raman signals can be enhanced by several orders (107to 1010) of magnitude by using plasmonic nanoparticlesviathe electromagnetic mechanism (EM) and chemical mechanism (CM).17–27For rapid and highly sensitive identification, SERS has been employed using 4-aminothiophenol (4-ATP) as reporter molecule, attached to gold nanoparticlesviaAu–S bonds. In the presence of COVID-19 antigen or virus particles, the aggregated nanoparticles form “hot spots”. As we and other groups have reported, that “hot spot” formation is a very important factor to provide extraordinary enhancement in SERS;17–27in the presence of COVID-19 antigen or virus particles strong SERS signals from 4-aminothiophenol have been observed, which allow diagnosis of viral antigen even at a concentration of 4 picograms (pg) per mL and virus at 18 virus particles per mL concentration. It is now well documented that for SARS-CoV-2, the viral infection starts with the binding of viral particles to receptors on the host cells, mediated by the virus spike protein.8–17,34–41As different studies indicate that spike protein binds specifically to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on the surface of human cells,8–17scientists from several groups are developing inhibitors that have the capability to block the mechanism by which the virus binds to the ACE2 receptor.34–41Herein, using pseudo SARS-CoV-2 as the model virus, we demonstrate that anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles have the capability to block viral entry into cells. Pseudo SARS-CoV-2 is a BSL-1 baculovirus pseudotyped with spike (S) protein. Using HEK293T cells, which express ACE2, by means of which SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells, we demonstrate that anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles block viral replication and virus spread in HEK293T cells.

This table also reports how the size of anti-spike antibody attached GNPs varies in the presence of different amounts of COVID-19 antigenviaaggregation. Fig. 1.

(D) Absorption spectra from antibody attached GNPs in the presence of different concentrations of COVID-19 antigen. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectrum from citrate coated gold nanoparticles shown in Fig. S2D†shows (111), (200), (220) and (311) diffraction peaks, due to face centered cubic gold (JCPDS 04-0784).20–30The particle concentration was measured by UV-visible spectroscopy using the molar extinction coefficient at the wavelength of the maximum absorption of the gold colloid (ε(15)519nm= 3.6 × 108cm−1M−1), as we and others have reported before.28–30 PEG coated gold nanoparticle synthesis Anti-spike antibody coated gold nanoparticle synthesis The Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum from anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles shown in Fig. S2E†contains amide-A, amide-I, amide-II and amide-II bands, which indicates that anti-spike-antibodies are attached on the surface of the gold nanoparticles. The inset picture in Fig. S1C†shows the color of freshly prepared antibody GNPs is pink.Fig. 2Dshows the absorption spectra of antibody attached gold nanoparticles, in whichλmaxis ∼522 nm, which indicate that after attaching antibody, the optical spectrum for GNPs remains almost the same.

Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy using anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles For the detection of COVID-19 antigen and virus using SERS, we used our developed portable Raman spectrometer with laser excitation of 670 nm.22–24,26,27In our design we have used an InPhotonics 670 nm Raman fiber optic probe for excitation and data collection. For SERS signal collection, we used a miniaturized QE65000 Scientific-grade Spectrometer from Ocean Optics.22–24,26,27All SERS spectra were taken on drop-cast dried glass slides. For Raman data collection we used 10 second acquisition time and 5-scan averaging, so that we could achieve very good signal-to-noise ratio.22–24,26,27 SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype particles Pseudo SARS-CoV-2 (Cat. # C1110G) was purchased from Montana Molecular, Bozeman, MT 59715, USA. HEK293T cells (ATCC # CRL3216) plated in twelve-well tissue culture dishes were infected with the pseudotyped virus with a dilution range of 102to 107, and virus titers were calculated by counting green fluorescent protein (GFP) positive cells under a fluorescence microscope.36–38 HEK293T cells (ATCC # CRL3216) were plated on a 96-well plate in complete medium (DMEM + 10% FBS) and incubated under normal growth conditions (5% CO2and 37 °C, protected from light) for 12–24 hours.36–38These HEK293T cells express low levels of ACE2 receptor which are sufficient for SARS-CoV-2 entry. Dilutions of test nanoparticles were made in DMEM with a final volume of 100 μL each.36–38The pseudovirus stock (2.5 μL of the 2 × 1010units permL stock) was mixed with the diluted nanoparticles and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, then laid over HEK293T cells plated in the 96-well tissue culture dishes, along with 0.6 μL of 500 nM sodium butyrate (to give a final concentration of 2 mM). Plates were incubated at 37 °C under 5% CO2for 48 h. Cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde and the assay was read on a Cytation 5 automated fluorescence microscope (BioTek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT, USA).36–38 Naked eye colorimetric diagnosis of COVID-19 antigen using anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles To determine the sensitivity of naked eye colorimetric assay for the identification of COVID-19 antigen using antibody attached GNPs, we performed an antigen concentration dependence study using from 1 pg mL−1to 10 000 pg mL−1COVID-19 antigen. As shown inFig. 1B, naked eye colorimetric assay can be used for the diagnosis of a minimum concentration of 1000 pg mL−1or 1 ng mL−1antigen. Next, we determined the selectivity of the naked eye colorimetric assay for the identification of COVID-19 antigen using antibody attached GNPs. Since COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are all coronaviruses, we also performed the same experiment for SARS-CoV virus antigen and MERS-CoV antigen separately using anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles. As shown inFig. 1C, we did not observe any colorimetric change even when 5 ng mL−1SARS-CoV virus antigen or MERS-CoV antigen was added to the pink solution of anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles. The above reported data clearly show that the antibody attached GNP-based naked eye colorimetric assay is highly selective for COVID-19 spike-antigen. Naked eye colorimetric diagnosis of pseudo SARS-CoV-2 using antibody attached GNPs To determine the sensitivity of naked eye colorimetric assay for the identification of pseudo SARS-CoV-2 using antibody attached GNPs, we performed a pseudo SARS-CoV-2 concentration dependence study from 10 virus particles per mL to 5000 virus particles per mL. As shown inFig. 2E, naked eye colorimetric assay can be used for the diagnosis of a minimum concentration of 1000 virus particles per mL of pseudo SARS-CoV-2. Our reported naked eye colorimetric assay for SARS virus detection exhibits slightly higher sensitivity than the antibody attached GNP-based influenza A virus detection as reported by Liuet al.40 Highly sensitive SERS diagnosis of COVID-19 antigen and pseudo SARS-CoV-2 using antibody attached GNPs Although naked eye colorimetric assay is capable of the identification of COVID-19 antigen and pseudo SARS-CoV-2 within a 5 minute time period, the sensitivity is low. To enhance the sensitivity significantly, we employed SERS for the diagnosis of COVID-19 antigen and pseudo SARS-CoV-2. As shown inFig. 3A, for rapid and highly sensitive identificationviaSERS, we used 4-aminothiophenol as reporter molecule, which is attached to gold nanoparticlesviaAu–S bonds. Synthesis details are reported in the ESI.† Fig. 3. (A) A schematic diagram showing the synthetic path we used for the development of antibody and 4-aminothiophenol coated gold nanoparticles.

(H) FDTD simulation data showing how the (|E|2) profile varies with an increase in the number of gold nanoparticles in aggregates. Fig. 3Bshows the SERS spectra from anti-spike antibody (10 ng mL−1) only attached GNPs (1.3 nM), 4-aminothiophenol (300 nM) only attached GNPs (1.3 nM) and antibody (10 ng mL−1) as well as 4-aminothiophenol (300 nM) attached gold nanoparticles (1.3 nM). As shown inFig. 3B, in the absence of the 4-aminothiophenol Raman reporter, we did not see any Raman signal, which clearly shows that the observed Raman spectrum is mainly due to the presence of the 4-aminothiophenol Raman reporter. The Raman spectrum inFig. 3Bfrom anti-spike antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticles shows Raman peaks due to the a1vibrational modes:ν(C–C + NH2bend) at ∼1590 cm−1andν[ν(C–C) +δ(C–H)] at ∼1078 cm−1.17–27Similarly, we also observed b2mode Raman peaks from the anti-spike antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticles, as shown inFig. 3B: CC stretch in Ph ring + NH2rock at ∼1435 cm−1andν(C–N) +ν(C–S) +γ(CCC) vibrational modes at 464 cm−1.17–27 Our SERS-based diagnosis of COVID-19 antigens using antibody attached GNPs is based on the fact that in the presence of COVID-19 antigen, owing to the antigen–antibody interaction, antibody attached GNPs aggregate and form several “hot spots”, as shown in Fig. S2A–C in the ESI.†It is now well documented that “hot spot” formation is a very important factor to provide extraordinary enhancement in SERS, owing to the strong light–matter interactionviaplasmon-excitation coupling.17–27As shown inFig. 3C, very strong SERS signals from anti-spike antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticles are observed in the presence of COVID-19 Spike Recombinant Antigen; this is due to the formation of huge amounts of electromagnetic “hotspots”, which enhances Raman intensity by several orders of magnitudevialight–matter and matter–matter interactions.17–27 To understand better how “hot spot” formation greatly enhances the SERS signal, we performed finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation.22–24,42,43Theoretical details have been reported before by our group and other groups.22–24,26,27,42,43For the simulation, we used 20 nm spherical gold nanoparticles, 670 nm wavelength, 0.001 nm mesh resolution, and 4000 fs time.22–24,26,27Fig. 3Hshows how the square of field enhancement (|E|2) varies with distance for nanoparticles. The FDTD simulation data inFig. 3Hindicate a more than 2 orders of magnitude higher field enhancement in “hot spot” positions when gold nanoparticles formed aggregates. As we and others have reported before, Raman enhancement is proportional to |E|4,22–24,26,27,42,43and as a result, reported FDTD simulation data indicate that there is a possibility of 4 orders of magnitude Raman enhancement in “hot spot” positions when gold nanoparticles form aggregates. Having observed a huge Raman signal enhancement in the presence of COVID-19 antigen, to determine the sensitivity of SERS assay for the identification of COVID-19 antigen using anti-spike antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticles, we performed an antigen concentration dependence study using 1 pg mL−1to 2000 pg mL−1COVID-19 antigen. As shown inFig. 3C, SERS assay can be used for the diagnosis of a minimum concentration of 1 pg mL−1antigen, where we observed a more than 2-fold increment of the Raman signal.Fig. 3Dshows how the Raman signal at 1078 cm−1from anti-spike antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticles varies with the concentration of COVID-19 antigen. To determine the limit of detection (LOD), we used the following equation:22–24 whereσis the standard deviation of the blank andSis the slope of the calibration curve. For the determination of the standard deviation of the blank, we used the baseline noise. Using the concentration–dependence plot shown inFig. 3D, we estimated the LOD to be ∼4 pg mL−1for SERS assay using COVID-19 antigen. Next, we determined the selectivity of the SERS assay for the identification of COVID-19 antigen using anti-spike antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticles. For this purpose, we also performed the same SERS experiment for SARS-CoV virus antigen and MERS-CoV antigen separately using anti-spike antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticles. As shown inFig. 3E, we did not observe any SERS intensity change even when 1 ng mL−1SARS-CoV antigen or MERS-CoV antigen was added to anti-spike antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticles. The above reported data clearly show that antibody attached GNP-based SERS is highly selective for COVID-19 spike antigen. To determine the sensitivity of SERS assay for the identification of pseudo SARS-CoV-2 using anti-spike antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticles, we performed a virus concentration dependence study using from 10 to 1500 pseudo SARS-CoV-2 virus particles. As shown inFig. 3F, SERS assay can be used for the diagnosis of the minimum concentration of 10 virus particles per mL, where we observed a more than 2-fold increment of the Raman signal.Fig. 3Gshows how the Raman signal at 1078 cm−1from anti-spike antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticles varies with the concentration of pseudo SARS-CoV-2. Usingeqn (1)and the concentration-dependent linear plot shown inFig. 3G, we estimated the LOD to be ∼18 virus particles per mL for SERS assay using pseudo SARS-CoV-2. The sensitivity of our reported SERS detection assay is comparable with the Abbott Real Time SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay (40 copies per mL).44 Inhibition of pseudo SARS-CoV-2 using anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles It is now well documented that SARS-CoV-2 fusion with host cell membranes proceeds through interactions between spike proteins of the virus and the ACE2 receptor on the surface of human cells.5–16,34–41To find out whether anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles have the capability to block entry of the virus into cells, we used pseudo SARS-CoV-2 (# C1110G, Montana Molecular, Bozeman, MT) as the model virus.36–38For our inhibition experiment we used HEK293T cells, which express ACE2, by which SARS-CoV-2 entry in human cells is determined.36–38As shown inFig. 4A–C, anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles block viral replication and virus spread in HEK293T cells. Our data show that the inhibition efficiency was 100% for 100 ng mL−1anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles and 60% for 10 ng mL−1anti-spike antibody attached GNPs. In contrast, our experimental data indicate that the inhibition efficiencies for PEG coated GNPs and 100 ng mL−1antibody only were very low, less than 1%. Thus, for the design of anti-spike antibody GNPs we used 100 ng mL−1antibody, since our data indicated 100% inhibition efficiency in the presence of 100 ng mL−1anti-spike-antibody attached gold nanoparticles. Fig. 4. (A) SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression in infected HEK293T cells in the absence of antibody attached gold nanoparticles. (B) SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus GFP expression in infected HEK293T cells in the presence of 10 ng mL−1anti-spike antibody. (C) Variations in the inhibition efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression in infected HEK293T cells in the presence of buffer (Mock), gold nanoparticles (GNPs), anti-spike antibody, and anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles. (D) A TEM image showing that 100 ng mL−1anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles can break the lipid membrane of pseudo SARS-CoV-2. The inhibition is possibly due to antibody attached gold nanoparticles binding to pseudo SARS-CoV-2, thereby inhibiting the virus from binding to the cell receptor,14,34–41and as a result, preventing the virus from infecting the targeted cells.34–41But also, as shown inFig. 4D, antibody attached GNPs have the capability to break the lipid membrane of pseudo SARS-CoV-2, so that the virus particle collapses.34–41And, as we and others have reported before, gold nanoparticles suppress viral infection by selectively cleaving disulfide bonds, which blocks membrane fusion and viral entry to the host cell.14,34,35,38–41We believe that all the above discussed mechanisms are responsible for the 100% inhibition efficiency observed using the anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles. Using HEK293T cells, which express angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), by means of which SARS-CoV-2 gains entry into human cells, we demonstrated that anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles have the capability to control viral infection. Our reported data show that the inhibition efficiency is 100% for anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles. On the other hand, for GNPs alone the inhibition efficiency is only around 1% and for 100 ng mL−1antibody the inhibition efficiency is less than 1%. That our reported data indicate 100% inhibition efficiency in the presence of anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles may be due to the fact that antibody attached gold nanoparticles bind to pseudo SARS-CoV-2, thereby inhibiting the virus from binding to cell receptors. Our data show that antibody attached GNPs block viral replication and virus spread in HEK293T cells. They also destroy the virus lipid membrane. There are no conflicts of interest to declare.",
