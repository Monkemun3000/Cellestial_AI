  "content": "NADPH Oxidase activity is required for ER stress survival in plants Corresponding author: Federica Brandizzi,fb@msu.edu, Phone: (517) 353-7872, Fax: (517) 353-9168 Although reactive oxygen species (ROS) are known to be produced during endoplasmic reticulum stress, the source of ROS and their potential effects on the canonical unfolded protein response (UPR) are largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that the respiratory burst oxidase homologs RBOHD and RBOHF positively contribute to plant survival under these conditions. Physiological and stress situations causing insufficiency of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to meet cellular demands for secretory protein folding lead to a potentially lethal condition, known as ER stress (Gething et al. 1992). To overcome ER stress and restore homeostasis, protective signaling cascades, collectively called the unfolded protein response (UPR), are originated at the ER and lead to the synthesis of ER chaperones and foldases to attenuate ER stress. If this adaptive UPR fails, such in conditions of unresolved or chronic ER stress, cells commit to programmed cell death (Ron et al. 2007,Ruberti et al. 2015,Angelos et al. 2017). In all eukaryotes, the adaptive phase of the UPR is initiated with the activation of IRE1, an ER-associated membrane kinase and ribonuclease, which catalyzes the unconventional splicing of transcripts of bZIP-transcription factors: yeastHac1, mammalianXbp1, or plantbZIP60. This step is necessary for the production of an active transcription factor that controls the expression of UPR target genes (Deng et al. 2011,Nagashima et al. 2011,Moreno et al. 2012). In multicellular eukaryotes, the UPR has expanded to include additional UPR effectors, such as membrane tethered bZIP transcription factors (MTTFs), namely mammalian ATF6 and plant bZIP28. Upon sensing ER stress, these MTTFs translocate to the Golgi, where the cytosol-exposed transcription factor domain is proteolytically removed from the transmembrane anchor and translocated to the nucleus for the transcriptional regulation of UPR target genes (Liu et al. 2007b,Gao et al. 2008,Srivastava et al. 2013,Sun et al. 2013). In plants, a functional connection between ROS and the UPR management has not yet been clearly defined. During growth and in conditions of stress, several organelles including the mitochondria, chloroplasts, and peroxisomes generate ROS intracellularly (Tripathy et al. 2012). ROS are also produced in the apoplast mainly by the activity of the membrane-bound NADPH Oxidase (NOX) enzymes, known in plants as respiratory burst oxidase homologues (RBOH) (Torres et al. 2002). The NOX/RBOH enzymes generate O2−through electron transfer from NADPH to oxygen (Gapper et al. 2006). O2−is highly reactive and is dismutated to H2O2either via the superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzymes or spontaneously (Mori et al. 2004). H2O2is more stable than O2−and moves through membranes via aquaporins (Bienert et al. 2007), and it is therefore considered as a potent signaling ROS in plants (Sadhukhan et al. 2017). Thus far in plants, an increase of soluble H2O2and lipid peroxidation during ER stress have been reported (Ozgur et al. 2014,Ozgur et al. 2015,Ozgur et al. 2018) but the source of ROS during ER stress and the influence of ER-stress generated ROS on UPR signaling are not yet established. The oxidative function of ERO1 in the ER lumen is a significant source of ER peroxides both in homeostatic conditions of growth and during ER stress; however, an increase in NADPH Oxidase activity has also been observed via biochemical assays during the early UPR (Tu et al. 2004,Sevier et al. 2008,Zito 2015,Ozgur et al. 2018). Under similar conditions, small inductions in transcript levels of RBOHD and RBOHF, two plasma membrane-localized NADPH Oxidases (Torres et al. 2002,Torres et al. 2005), were also noted in tissues subjected to ER stress treatment, leading to the suggestion that increases in ROS levels were due to the respiratory burst oxidase homologs D and F (RBOHD and RBOHF) (Ozgur et al. 2014). Nonetheless, it is yet to be experimentally tested to what extent RBOH activity contributes to the ROS levels during ER stress, and whether these enzymes are necessary for the actuation of effective ER stress responses. More generally, the downstream effects of increased ROS levels during plant ER stress responses are also largely unmapped. Previous reports have shown a variable regulation of the antioxidant defense systems under conditions of ER stress. For example, in conditions of ER stress the O2−scavenging activity of superoxide dismutase is induced in roots, but down-regulated in shoots. Conversely, H2O2scavenging activities of catalase and ascorbate peroxidase are upregulated in shoots but have no change in roots (Ozgur et al. 2014). However, in both roots and shoots a significantly increased glutathione content and glutathione reductase activity during ER stress lends weight to the conclusion that antioxidant defenses are upregulated to manage the increased ROS production in ER stress (Ozgur et al. 2014). Nonetheless, critical questions remain unanswered. For example, it is yet unknown what effects an increase in ROS levels may have on the adaptive UPR, nor is it understood whether ROS may contribute to life or death decisions in temporary and chronic ER stress. To address these fundamental questions, in this work we explored the functional connection between ROS and the UPR in plants. We demonstrate that O2−and H2O2are significantly contributed by RBOHD and RBOHF during ER stress. We also show that RBOHD and RBOHF elicit a transcriptional response to ROS during ER stress in the adaptive UPR. Furthermore, we provide evidence for a stringent requirement of RBOHD and RBOHF to prevent the progression of cell death in recovery from temporary ER stress and under chronic ER stress. Together, these findings support a positive role of superoxide signaling in potentiating the cell’s ability to survive temporary and chronic ER stress and ascribe a significant role to two RBOH proteins in this process. ER stress induces accumulation of superoxide by NADPH Oxidases In situ detection and semi-quantification of superoxide in root tissues by staining with nitro-tetrazolium blue (NBT)A. WT orrbohd rbohfseedlings treated with 1.0 μg/ml Tm, 1.0 μg/ml TM + 2.5 μM DPI, or DMSO were stained with NBT after 24 or 48 hours. †: mature zone; ‡: maturation zone; Δ: root tip. B. Tissue-specific differences in superoxide are shown by relative pixel intensities of NBT stain from the root tip ± SE.

RBOHD and RBOHF are necessary for recovery from short-term and chronic ER stress RBOHD and RBOHF contribute to preventing ER stress induced cell death NADPH Oxidases contribute to ROS production in conditions of ER stress Although, the exact molecular mechanisms leading to activation of these enzymes in response to ER stress have yet to be elucidated, a regulation of RBOH enzymes by altered cytosolic calcium levels and association with G-protein signaling components may be postulated as contributing factors. In metazoans cellular calcium ion homeostasis is intimately linked with ER stress, as calcium is required for the proper functioning of ER luminal foldase activities (Krebs et al. 2015). Inhibition of sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) transporters leads to the induction of ER stress and the UPR (Krebs et al. 2015). Upon prolonged UPR activation, a number of factors, including ER lumen hyper-oxidation by ER oxidase 1a (ERO1a), leads to calcium release from the ER through activation of inositol triphosphate receptors (IP3R) and apoptotic events (Sovolyova et al. 2014). Although IP3R-like ER calcium channels have yet to be identified in plants, SERCA-like transporters have been identified (Liang et al. 1997). Therefore it is possible that ER stress/UPR induction could alter ER and cytosolic calcium levels, which can promote RBOHD activation (Ogasawara et al. 2008). Furthermore, in plant responses to bacterial pathogen attack, it has also been demonstrated that a null mutation in the Arabidopsis Gβ subunit (agb1)of the heterotrimeric G-protein plasma membrane signaling complex was epistatic to therbohd rbohfnull mutation(Torres et al. 2013). The AGB1 gene acts in concert with receptor-like kinases to mediate oxidative burst response to pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) triggered immunity(Liu et al. 2013,Liu et al. 2016b). Although it is yet to be tested whether AGB1 interacts genetically with RBOHD and RBOHF in ER stress, similar torbohd rbohf, agb1is sensitive to chronic ER stress (Chen et al. 2012). It is therefore possible that AGB1 may contribute to RBOH signaling in conditions of ER stress. Unlike in metazoans, NADPH Oxidase-produced ROS are beneficial to overcome ER stress in plants Homeostasis of NADPH Oxidase activity is required to maintain an effective UPR In ER stress conditions, the production of ROS is antagonized by IRE1 and the bZIP60/bZIP28 transcription factors Plant Materials and Growth Conditions Arabidopsis thalianaecotype Columbia (Col-0),rbohd rbohf, (Torres et al. 2002)ire1a ire1b, andbzip60 bzip28(Chen et al. 2012,Deng et al. 2013) plants were used in this study. For all experiments, surface-sterilized seeds were plated directly onto petri dishes containing half-strength Linsmaier and Skoog (½ LS) medium, 1.0% w/v sucrose, and 1.0% agar and then cold treated (4°C) in the dark for two days to synchronize germination. Plates were then transferred to a Percival growth chamber and incubated for the indicated time at 21°C under continuous light (130 μE). Superoxide Histochemical Staining and Quantification Extraction and Quantification of H2O2in Seedling Tissues using Amplex Ultra Red A working solution of catalase was prepared by centrifuging ten microliters of ammonium sulfate catalase suspension (Sigma, C3515–10MG). The clear ammonium sulfate supernatant was then removed before catalase pellet was dissolved in 600 microliters of ddH2O. Five microliters of catalase working solution was then added to the remaining neutralized sample extracts in microcentrifuge tubes. These samples were incubated at room temperature for a minimum of 10 minutes. One hundred microliters of the catalase treated supernatants were then stored in the same 96 well plate on ice. An H2O2standard curve was prepared by serial dilution of 30% H2O2to concentrations of 100 μM, 50 μM 25 μM 10 μM and 5 μM which were then diluted 10x (from 50 microliter aliquots) by sequential addition of 200 microliters of 10% TCA, 122 microliters of 1M sodium bicarbonate and 128 microliters of ddH2O to mimic extraction procedure. Final concentrations of H2O2standards therefore ranged from 10 μM to 0.5 μM. NTCA extraction resulted in no net loss of H2O2. H2O2standards were prepared fresh daily. Amplex Ultra Red (AUR) working solution was prepared by dissolving 1 vial of AUR in 340 microliters of DMSO per manufacturer’s instructions to make a 10mM AUR stock. AUR assay solutions were prepared immediately before use. Fifty microliters of AUR stock was added to 10 ml of ddH2O containing 5 μg/ml commercial horseradish peroxidase (AUR-HRP) and to another 10 ml of ddH2O without HRP (AUR-NoHRP). Solutions were kept on ice and protected from light. All assays were performed in clear 96 well microplates and prepared on a cold block. Twenty five microliters of neutralized samples and catalase treated samples were always pipetted prior to addition of 75 microliters of the appropriate AUR assay solution by multichannel pipette. The plate was then briefly incubated (5 min) at room temperature in the dark. Longer incubation periods did not lead to greater differences between catalase treated samples and untreated samples, only increases in AUR chemical auto-oxidation. The microplates were read using a SpectramaxM2 (Molecular Devices) equipped with fluorescence detection capabilities. The excitation wavelength was set to 544 nm, and emission was recorded at 590 nm. To assay H2O2accumulation under ER stress conditions WT,rbohd rbohf,ire1a ire1b, andbzip60 bzip28were grown for 7 days and transferred to plates containing 1.0 μg/ml Tm or DMSO for 6, 24, or 48 hours as indicated, and harvested at the same time on consecutive days. Three biological replicates consisting of approximately 30–60 mg of seedling tissue each were briefly dried on a Kimwipe and exact fresh weight recorded before samples were placed in 1.7ml microcentrifuge tubes with two glass beads, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Samples were ground to a fine powder in a Retch MM301 (Retch; Haan, Germany) by agitation at a frequency of 30/sec for two sets of 30 seconds which were separated by refreezing in liquid nitrogen and stored in liquid nitrogen. Samples were extracted with NTCA, and then treated with catalase as indicated. For each biological replicate the neutralized samples and catalase samples were assayed in two technical replicates in the same plate with a standard curve. Each genotype was assayed in a separate plate. The catalase labile signal was calculated by subtracting average fluorescence intensity of catalase treated replicates from the average fluorescence intensity of the neutralized sample replicates. The samples were compared to the individual H2O2standard curves to derive an [H2O2] of the samples, and total micromoles of H2O2in the extract. This was normalized to recorded sample fresh weights. RNA extraction and Quantitative RT-PCR Analyses The RNA measurement experiments were performed in parallel with the H2O2quantification experiments. Seedlings germinated under normal growth conditions and grown for 7 days were transferred to plates containing ½ LS media with 1.0% sucrose and 1.0 μg/ml Tm or DMSO for 6, 24, or 48 hours as indicated, and harvested at the same time on two consecutive days. Groups of 5–10 seedlings were pooled placed in 1.7ml microcentrifuge tubes with two glass beads, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted from whole seedlings using a NucleoSpin Plant RNA kit (Machery-Nagel) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, including on column DNase Digestion. All samples within the experiment were reverse-transcribed using iScript Reverse Transcriptase. RT-PCR with SYBR Green detection using a ΔΔctmethod was performed in technical triplicates using the Applied Biosystem 7500 Fast Real-Time 7500 PCR system, and data normalized to the expression of UBQ10 (AT4G05320). The values presented are the mean of three independent biological replicates ±SE. Recovery from ER stress, and Chronic ER stress Phenotypic Analyses For the recovery from ER stress experiments WT,rbohd rbohf, andire1a ire1bwere germinated on ½ LS plates grown vertically for 5 days, transferred to liquid ½ LS media containing 1.0 μg ml−1Tm for 6 hours, then replated on ½ LS plates and grown vertically for a further 3 days. The plates were then photographed and the root lengths of at least 30 individuals from 4 separate plates were determined using ImageJ; the mean ±SE was then calculated. In groups of two shoots were excised, fresh weight recorded, placed in 1.7ml microcentrifuge tubes with two glass beads, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. For the chronic ER stress experiments WT,rbohd rbohf,ire1a ire1b, andbzip60 bzip28were germinated on ½ LS plates containing DMSO, 5 ng/ml, 10 ng/ml, or 25 ng/ml Tm and grown for two weeks then photographed. In groups of five, shoots were excised, fresh weight recorded, placed in 1.7ml microcentrifuge tubes with two glass beads, and then frozen in liquid nitrogen. For both ER stress recovery and chronic stress experiments, total chlorophyll content (chlorophyll a+ chlorophyll b) per mg fresh weight was determined as described previously (Tait et al. 2003). Samples were ground to a fine powder in a Retch MM301 (Retch; Haan, Germany) by agitation at a frequency of 30/sec for two sets of 30 seconds which were separated by refreezing in liquid nitrogen. From the liquid nitrogen 1 ml of DMSO was added to the sample tubes, inverted until mixed then incubated at room temperature for 20 minutes in the dark. Samples were then centrifuged at 21000xg and 200ul aliquots added to a clear 96 well plate for spectrophotometric quantification of chlorophyll content using a SpectramaxM2 (Molecular Devices). For all experiments at least 10 biological replicates for each experimental group were recorded, presented data represents the mean ±SE. Electrolyte Leakage Measurements WT,rbohd rbohf, ire1a ire1b, andbzip60 bzip28seedlings were grown for 7 days then transferred to plates containing 1.0 μg/ml Tm, or DMSO. Seedlings were imaged after six days on treatment plates. After 48 and 144 hours the extent of cell death was determined by quantification of percent electrolyte leakage as described previously with minor modifications (Dong et al. 2006,Lee et al. 2010). Groups of five seedlings were briefly washed in ddH2O, and then incubated in 4 ml of ddH2O for 3 hours in glass culture tubes with gentle agitation. Liquid conductivity was measured (Measurement 1). The tubes were autoclaved with caps and allowed to cool under gentle agitation for 3 hours. Total conductivity was measured (measurement 2) and percentage of the total was calculated as (%=measurement1/measurement2*100).
