Space exploration and extraterrestrial civilization have fascinated humankind since the earliest days of human history. It was only in the last century that humankind finally began taking significant steps towards these goals by sending astronauts into space, landing on the moon, and building the International Space Station. However, space voyage is very challenging and dangerous, and astronauts are under constant space radiation and microgravity. It has been shown that astronauts are at a high risk of developing a broad range of diseases/disorders. Thus, it is critical to develop a rapid and effective assay to monitor astronauts’ health in space. In this study, gene expression and correlation patterns were analyzed for 10 astronauts (8 male and 2 female) using the publicly available microarray dataset E-GEOD-74708. We identified 218 differentially expressed genes between In-flight and Pre-flight and noticed that space travel decreased genome regulation and gene correlations across the entire genome, as well as individual signaling pathways. Furthermore, we systematically developed a shortlist of 32 genes that could be used to monitor astronauts’ health during space travel. Further studies, including microgravity experiments, are warranted to optimize and validate the proposed assay. “Space: the final frontier.” [1]. Every fan of the American science fiction TV series Star Trek is likely to remember this cardinal line of the opening monologue. Indeed, space exploration and extraterrestrial civilization have continually fascinated humankind; however, it was only in the last century that humankind finally took a solid step forward by sending astronauts into space and landing on the moon [2,3]. In the 21stcentury, humankind has made another great leap forward in space exploration: expediting the International Space Station (ISS) program [4], sending unmanned rovers to seek signs of life on Mars [5,6], and starting private space ventures [7,8]. In addition, NASA (The National Aeronautics and Space Administration) is planning to send astronauts back to the moon in 2024 and to Mars in the 2030s [9]. Through all these endeavors, we have seen the twilight of crewed space missions going beyond our harbor (Earth) and into deep space. Space travel is challenging, dangerous, and full of uncertainty. Astronauts are under sustained microgravity and cosmic radiation. Prolonged exposure to microgravity and cosmic radiation has been shown to cause a series of health problems, including loss of muscle mass [10,11], reduced bone density [12,13], compromised immune responses [14,15], impaired renal functions [16], neurological system irresponsiveness [17,18], and development of cardiovascular diseases [19,20]. Furthermore, microgravity and cosmic radiation can cause several types of cancer, such as leukemia, likely due to compromised immunity [21]. However, studies under simulated microgravity also show that microgravity affects cell proliferation and apoptosis and can change cancer cells into less malignant phenotypes [22,23,24]. These studies indicate that the impact of microgravity and cosmic radiation on human health is profound, and it is unlikely that this impact is due to changes in one gene or a small group of genes. Therefore, genomic, transcriptomic, and/or proteomic studies are crucial to fully understand the effects of microgravity and cosmic radiation on human health. These studies can lead to the development of effective strategies to monitor, prevent, and/or alleviate the effects on human health caused by space travel. Approximately 12 years ago, NASA and JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) undertook a microarray study on 10 astronauts (8 male and 2 female) who had a six-month mission at the ISS [25]. Terada et al. used qPCR to confirm that space flight changed gene expression in astronauts [25]. Several genes, includingFGF18,ANGPTL7, andCOMP, were upregulated and might play a role in inhibiting cell proliferation in hair follicles. However, they neither discussed the potential effects of the differentially expressed genes on the astronauts’ health nor provided any strategy to monitor these effects. Thus, in the current study, we reanalyzed this microarray dataset, conceptualized a method that could monitor the effects of space travel on astronauts’ health, and searched for potential intervention options. Microarray dataset E-GEOD-74708, which is the largest publicly available space gene expression dataset, was downloaded from the NASA GeneLab Database (https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab, accessed on 15 March 2021). It contains gene expression profiles for 10 astronauts (8 male and 2 female) that stayed in the ISS between July 2009 and February 2013. For each astronaut, 2 profiles were collected at each of the three time points, Pre-flight (prior to departing for the ISS), In-flight (while staying at the ISS), and Post-flight (after return to the ground). Individual gene expression profiles were combined into three DataFrames: Pre-flight, In-flight, and Post-flight using the Pandas package (version 1.3.0) in Python [26]. These DataFrames were analyzed for possible outliers and verified for accuracy. Gene expression readings with null values were removed. Then, Agilent IDs in the data were mapped to gene names using the Ensembl BioMart database (https://www.ensembl.org/biomart/martview, accessed on 15 March 2021). 2.3. DEG Identification and Signaling Pathway Analysis Differentially expressed genes (DEGs: ∣log2FC∣ ≥ 3.00 andp< 0.05) were identified between the In-flight and the Pre-flight DataFrames using the DEGseq package (version 1.42.0) in R [27]. The Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) function was applied in the calculation. No DEGs were identified between the Post-flight and the In-flight DataFrames. The DEGs between In-flight and Pre-flight were then subjected to signaling pathway analysis using the InnateDB tool [28]. 2.4. Calculation of Gene Pair Correlation Matrices Pairwise Pearson correlation coefficient matrices for the 3 gene expression DataFrames were calculated using formular=Σ(xi−x_)(yi−y_)Σ(xi−x_)2Σ(yi−y_)2. The correlation matrices were subsequently transferred to be visualized using an R platform. To analyze gene pair correlations for the signaling pathways, the expression profiles of the genes for the pathways were extracted from the DataFrames to produce the DataFrame subsets. For each signaling pathway, pairwise Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated and visualized as outlined above between the In-flight and Pre-flight subsets and between the Post-flight and In-flight subsets. Positive and negative correlations were represented in blue and red, respectively. Additionally, gene pair correlation coefficient differentials, ΔCC (In-Pre) = CCIn-flight– CCPre-flightand ΔCC (Post-In) = CCPost-flight– CCIn-flightwere calculated by matrix subtraction between the In-flight and Pre-flight subsets and between the Post-flight and In-flight subsets. These were subsequently visualized with correlation difference plots with positive and negative ΔCCs shown in green and red, respectively. 2.5. Protein–Protein Interaction Network and Disease Network Constructions The BioGrid database [29] and DisGeNET database [30] were downloaded in March 2021 to create a protein–protein interaction (PPI) network and extract the disease interaction information, respectively, for the DEGs. The networks were then constructed using Python and visualized using Cytoscape [31]. 2.6. Drug and miRNA Screenings The Drugbank [32] and miRTARBase [33] databases were also downloaded in March 2021 to extract the drug and miRNA interaction information for the DEGs. The networks were subsequently constructed using Python and visualized using Cytoscape. From these two networks, we identified potential drugs and miRNAs targeting the 32 genes that were identified to be used in a rapid RT2-PCR assay for space travel. 3.1. Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) Top 20 up- and down-regulated DEGs (differentially expressed genes) between In-flight and Pre-flight. The cut-off criteria for DEGs are ∣log2FC∣ ≥ 3.00 andp< 0.05. As expected, the DEGs between In-flight and Pre-flight regulate a broad spectrum of biological and physiological functions. For example, the most up-regulated geneLIMCH1, encoding LIM and calponin-homology domains 1, activates the non-muscle myosin Iia complex, stabilizes focal adhesion, and inhibits cell migration [34,35]. Thus, the upregulation ofLIMCH1may explain observations that microgravity exposure can change cancer cells into less malignant phenotypes [22,23,24]. The second most up-regulated geneIER3encodes Immediate Early Response 3 and regulates cell apoptosis [36], inflammation [37], and tumorigenesis [38]. Upregulation ofIER3has been observed in several types of cancer and may regulate cancer progression [39,40]. This implies another possible reason, other than radiation exposure, that increases the risk of astronauts developing cancer during a prolonged period of space travel. The most down-regulated gene,NFATC1,encodes Nuclear Factor of Activated T Cells 1 and plays an important role in osteoblast differentiation [41], osteoclastogenesis [42], T-cell differentiation [43], lymphatic endothelial development [44], cardiac valve morphogenesis [45], and tumorigenesis [46]. The downregulation ofNFATC1may result in osteoporosis, immunocompromised conditions, and prostate cancer in astronauts during a prolonged space stay. The second most down-regulated gene,KIDINS220, encoding Kinase D Interacting Substrate 220, modulates the development and function of the nerve and cardiovascular systems [47,48]. The downregulation ofKIDINS220may contribute to the development of neurological disorders and cardiovascular diseases in astronauts. In summary, the large variation of the biological processes regulated by the DEGs provides a valuable resource of genes for us to develop a rapid assay kit (~20–30 genes) to monitor astronauts’ health conditions in space. However, it is noteworthy that the three genes reported by Terada et al.,FGF18,ANGPTL7, andCOMP, are not in the aforementioned DEG list because they failed to meet the cut-off criteria. Gene pair correlations of the whole genome (30,645 transcripts for 23,115 genes) for 10 astronauts during Pre-flight (A), In-flight (B), and Post-flight (C). Positive and negative correlations are represented in blue and red, respectively. 3.3. Signaling Pathway and Disease Network of the DEGs Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) present in the top 11 signaling pathways. Top 20 disease/disorder conditions and their respectively associated DEGs based on disease network analysis of 218 DEGs between In-flight and Pre-flight. 3.4. Design of a Rapid Assay for Space Travel Any biological or physiological process requires a delicate regulation of genes, including gene expression levels, interactions, and correlations. However, most genomics/genetic studies are focused on gene expression level rather than gene pair correlation. Although gene co-expressions and protein co-localizations are commonly studied in biomedical research, our research laboratory, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to apply gene pair correlation coefficient (a mathematical term) to describe and explain biological and medical questions [50,51,52]. Thus, to design a rapid assay to monitor astronauts’ health, we selected a set of genes with expression levels and gene pair correlations significantly altered by space travel. Gene pair correlations ((1): Pre-flight, (2): In-flight, and (3): Post-flight) and differentials of gene pair correlations (4): between In-flight and Pre-flight and (5): between Post-flight and In-flight for the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the top 11 signaling pathways. The top 11 signaling pathways are signal transduction, immune system, gene expression, metabolism, metabolism of proteins, generic transcription pathway, developmental biology, metabolism of lipids and lipoproteins, axon guidance, innate immune system, and disease. The top 11 signaling pathways were identified from InnateDB analysis of the 218 DEGs (∣log2FC∣ ≥ 3.00 andp< 0.05). Positive and negative gene pair correlations are represented in blue and red, respectively; and positive and negative differentials of gene pair correlations are represented in green and red, respectively. Gene pairs with significantly altered correlation coefficients between In-flight and Pre-flight (i.e., ∣ΔCC (CCIn-flight– CCPre-flight)∣ > 0.70) in the top 11 signaling pathways identified from signaling pathway analysis of the 218 DEGs between In-flight and Pre-flight. Gene pairs with correlation coefficients changed from positive to less/more positive (Category 1), positive to negative (Category 2), negative to positive (Category 3), and negative to less/more negative (Category 4) were highlighted in blue, green, brown, and red, respectively. Gene pairs with criteria of ∣ΔCC∣ > 0.70 and correlation changing from strong to weak, weak to strong, or strong to opposite strong from the top 11 signaling pathways. In this study, we analyzed the effects of space travel on gene expression and correlation using the publicly available microarray dataset E-GEOD-74708, and systematically developed a shortlist of genes for a novel rapid assay that could be used to monitor astronauts’ health in space. However, this study faces a few limitations. First, the sample size (10 astronauts) is small due to the nature of space travel and unstandardized space biology research. More sample collection is needed to optimize the monitoring assay. Secondly, there were only two female astronauts in the microarray dataset. To get better representation and higher accuracy in the analysis, more gene expression profiles from a diverse population of astronauts should be obtained. Future studies in simulated microgravity conditions will allow for the optimization and validation of the proposed assay. It is noteworthy that this assay may address only one facet of a complete monitoring and treatment approach for astronauts’ health in space. In practice, other factors such as biomarkers and physiological metrics should also be included in the approach. Despite these drawbacks, our current study proposes a new strategy to develop genome-based rapid assays. This strategy could also be applied to other research fields such as cancer diagnostic assays.
