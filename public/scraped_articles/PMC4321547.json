To whom correspondence should be addressed. E-mail:phmasson@wisc.edu How the polyamine cadaverine alters plant development is poorly understood. Here it is shown that natural variation inORGANIC CATION TRANSPORTER 1affects root length sensitivity to exogenous cadaverine. Key words:Arabidopsis, cadaverine, natural variation, polyamines, roots, transporter. Polyamines are organic cations that are prevalent in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Putrescine, spermidine, and spermine are the most common polyamines in plants, although thermospermine and cadaverine have also been found in many species includingArabidopsis thaliana(Shevyakovaet al., 2001;Knottet al., 2007). Polyamines exist both as free molecules and as conjugates to other small molecules, mainly hydroxycinnamic acids, or proteins (Bagni and Tassoni, 2001). Both free and conjugated polyamines are important for cellular processes including cell growth, cell division, transcription, translation, and cell death. Their positive charges allow for interactions with nucleic acids, lipids, and proteins, which affect the activities and stabilities of these molecules (for a review, seeHussainet al., 2011). Polyamines accumulate in certain plant tissues under many abiotic stresses including drought, salt, osmotic, and temperature stress, which all result in metabolic reprogramming and modifications to growth (Cuevaset al., 2008;Aletet al., 2011;Wanget al., 2011). Polyamines may protect against these stresses in several ways, including by altering gene expression, increasing the activities of antioxidant enzymes, and altering the cellular accumulation of ions (Liuet al., 2000;Takahashiet al., 2003;Tang and Newton, 2005). They may also function as signals that regulate cross-talk between hormonal pathways during stress responses (Obata and Fernie, 2012). Though essential for proper development, and beneficial at higher levels during stress, catabolism of polyamines produces H2O2(Tisiet al., 2011). Although it is toxic, H2O2also diffuses to nearby tissues where it activates various responses (Neill, 2002). To balance these effects, polyamine synthesis, degradation, localization, and conjugation must be tightly controlled. Five potentialArabidopsisPOLYAMINE UPTAKE TRANSPORTER (PUT) proteins were identified based on sequence similarity to known polyamine transporters inLeishmania majorandTrympanosoma cruzi(Mulangiet al., 2012a,b). When expressed in the polyamine uptake-deficientΔagp2 Saccharomyces cerevisiaemutant (Aouidaet al., 2005), these proteins partially restored sensitivity to the polyamine analogue paraquat as well as to putrescine and spermidine. They also partially restored putrescine and spermidine uptake into the cells (Mulangiet al., 2012a). PAR1/PUT2 has subsequently been shown to localize to the Golgi where it is required for the subcellular localization of paraquat in the chloroplast (Liet al., 2013).RMV1/PUT3has been shown to be plasma membrane associated and to function in paraquat, putrescine, spermidine, and spermine uptake inArabidopsis(Fujitaet al., 2012). However, cadaverine transport by these proteins was not tested. Less is known about cadaverine compared with the other polyamines. It is synthesized from lysine and therefore not directly derived from the polyamine putrescine, unlike spermidine, spermine, and thermospermine. Cadaverine is produced by some soil bacteria and yeast, possibly contributing to rhizosphere–root signalling (Perriget al., 2007;Cloeteet al., 2009). Exogenous cadaverine affects root development in several ways: it increases adventitious root growth in pine trees, lateral root formation in soybeans, and root weight in rice (Gamarnik and Frydman, 1991;Niemiet al., 2002;Cassánet al., 2009), whereas it shortens primary roots in soybeans (Gamarnik and Frydman, 1991). Cadaverine levels and localization change upon exposure to stress. This molecule accumulates dramatically upon oxidative stress in rape leaves and upon drought stress in peppers (Azizet al., 1997;Szidericset al., 2010). In the ice plant, salt stress causes cadaverine to accumulate in true leaves (Kuznetsovet al., 2007), and heat shock stimulates cadaverine transport away from the heated tissue (Shevyakovaet al., 2001). Cadaverine also confers protection against stress. It induces stomatal closure, a common stress response, in fava beans (Liuet al., 2000), and it prevents decreases in root and shoot weight upon oxidative stress in rice (Cassánet al., 2009). Despite its profound impacts on overall cellular homeostasis and plant growth under stressful conditions, the underlying mechanisms that explain how cadaverine alters plant growth and development are still unknown. To address this gap, natural variation in root length sensitivity to exogenous cadaverine was examined, andORGANIC CATION TRANSPORTER 1(OCT1,AT1G73220) was identified as an important quantitative trait locus (QTL) involved in this response. QTL analysis used the following stocks from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (Columbus, OH, USA): Cape Verde Islands (Cvi; CS8580), Landsbergerecta-2 Ler-2; CS8581), and a population of Cvi/Lerrecombinant inbred lines (RILs; CS22000). This population consists of 162 individual RILs that were genotyped at 293 marker loci (Alonso-Blancoet al., 1998). The near isogenic lines (NILs) LCN1-12, -15, -14, -21, -22, and -28 (N717058, N17060, N17061, N17067, N17068, and N17074) (Keurentjeset al., 2007) were obtained from the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Center (Nottingham, UK). An-1 (CS22626), Bs-1 (CS6627), Knox-18 (CS22567), Sq-8 (CS22601), Ull2-3 (CS22587), and Wei-0 (CS22622) seed came from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center. Theoct1-1mutant andoct1-1[35Spro:OCT1WS] transgenic lines were provided by Christine Lelandais-Briere (Lelandais-Brièreet al., 2007). The seeds were sterilized by washing them with 95% ethanol. Except where noted in the text, they were plated on half-strength buffered Linsmaier and Skoog medium containing micro- and macronutrients, vitamins, and 1.5% sucrose (Caisson Laboratories, North Logan, UT, USA) that was supplemented with 1.5% agar type E (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and polyamines (Sigma-Aldrich) as required. The seedlings were stratified for 2–8 d and grown in either a Conviron TC16 growth chamber or an Enconair (now BioChambers, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada) Controller 6000 growth chamber for each experiment. Both chambers were set at 22 °C and a 16h light/8h dark cycle, and the light intensity was 50–70 μmol m–2s–1and provided by cool-white fluorescent bulbs (Grainger, Lake Forest, IL, USA). Seedling images were taken from the backs of the plates using a scanner (Epson, Suwa, Nagano Prefecture, Japan). Root length was measured using the segmented line tool in NIH Image (publically available athttp://rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/) or the Neuron J plugin (Meijeringet al., 2004) for Image J (Schneideret al., 2012). To calculate cell length, the cell walls were stained by transferring the seedlings to 10 μg ml–1propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich) for ~20min. Imaging was conducted using a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta Confocal microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY, USA), and cell length measurements were performed in Adobe Photoshop. Approximately 24 seedlings were grown at a 30 ° backward tilt at staggered times for each biological replicate on medium containing no cadaverine unless otherwise indicated. Whole roots from 7-day-old seedlings were dissected and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNA was prepared using an RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Venlo, The Netherlands) and stored at –80 ºC until use, typically within a few days. RNA samples were treated with RQ1 DNase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) according to the instructions. The ratios at absorbencies of 260 to 280 and at 260 to 230 as well as gel electrophoresis were used to verify RNA quality. Poor quality samples were not used for subsequent experiments. RNA concentrations were determined using a NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). For reverse transcription–PCR (RT–PCR), cDNA was made using the iScript™ cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). For quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), cDNA synthesis and qRT–PCR were done simultaneously using a qScript™ One-Step qRT-PCR Kit (Quanta Biosciences, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). The samples were run on a LightCycler®480 Real Time-PCR System (Roche Applied Science, Basel, Switzerland). Each 6 μl reaction contained RNA at a final concentration of 2ng μl–1and each primer at a concentration of 0.65 μM. Other components were included at the concentrations defined by the kit. Control reactions without reverse transcriptase were included and did not yield any detectable expression. Cycling conditions were 49 ºC for 10min, 95 ºC for 5min, and 45 cycles of 95 ºC for 5 s, 55 ºC for 15 s, and 72 ºC for 10 s. Melt curves were used to verify specificity. Four technical replicates were performed for each sample for each biological replicate, and three biological replicates were performed. LinRegPCR was used to analyse the data (Ramakerset al., 2003). The primers used to amplifyOCT1were: 1F (5′ GTGGCTGTT CCTTCCACACT 3′), 1R (5′ AAAGGCCGTGACGAAAGTTA 3′), 2F (5′ CATCCTCGACAGCGTATGAC 3′), 2R (5′ CCTTC CTAACGCAACTAGCA 3′), 3F (5′ TTTGGTGTTGCATCAGTG CT 3′), and 3R (5′ CGGAGCGTTTCGAGTTTCT 3′). 4R (5′ CGTGAAATGCGTGTTGAAAG 3′) was used to detect possible transcript that extended into the T-DNA region. Primers 3F and 3R as well as 5′ CCTCTTGGATACGCGGTTT 3′ and 5′ CAAGA AGCCATCGAGGAGAC 3′ were used forOCT1qRT–PCR. Primers used to amplify the reference gene At1g58050 (Czechowskiet al., 2005) were: 5′ CCATTCTACTTTTTGGCGGCT 3′ and 5′ TCAATGGTAACTGATCCACTCTGATG 3′. This reference gene was chosen due to its consistent expression and its similar expression level toOCT1(Czechowskiet al., 2005) Genomic DNA from Cvi and Lerwas used to amplify the region extending from 2079 bases before the start codon through to 417 bases after the stop codon ofOCT1. This region was cloned in between the attL1 and attL2 sites in the Gateway entry vector pENTR/D-TOPO (Life Technologies, Madison, WI, USA). An LR reaction was performed to transfer this region into the binary vector pMDC99 (Curtis and Grossniklaus, 2003;Xu and Li, 2008). The constructs were sequenced and transformed into plants using theAgrobacterium-mediated floral dip method (Clough and Bent, 1998). T3seedlings likely to all carry the transgene as determined by antibiotic resistance were used in all experiments (Harrisonet al., 2006). Arabidopsisaccessions vary in their root length responses to cadaverine Arabidopsisaccessions show varying root length inhibition responses to exogenous cadaverine. (A) Seedlings were grown vertically for 3 d and then at a 30 ° backward tilt for another 3 d. Average root length on control medium was set to 1. Absolute average root lengths on control medium were 1.4, 1.6, 2.5, 2.1, 2.1, 2.3, 2.0, and 2.3cm in the accessions as shown from left to right. The asterisk indicates the first cadaverine concentration corresponding to a significantly shorter root compared with control medium (P<0.05, Student’st-test). Error bars indicate ±SE, andn=12–27. (B) Images of Cvi-1 (top) and Ler-2 (bottom) seedlings growing on media without (left) and with (right) 100 μM cadaverine. The white scale bar is 1cm. (C) Average length of epidermal cells in the mature root zone from seedlings grown vertically for 7 d on either control medium or medium containing 100 μM cadaverine. Error bars indicate ±SE, andn=11–18. To determine whether the effect of cadaverine on root length was due to reduced cell elongation or division, the length of the epidermal cells in the mature root zone of Lerseedlings grown on media containing 0 μM or 100 μM cadaverine was measured. It was found that although Lerroots were only ~35% as long on this concentration of cadaverine as on control medium (Fig. 1A), the average cell length of the seedlings on the medium containing cadaverine was ~64% of that of seedlings on control medium (Fig. 1C). This suggests that the reduction in root length is probably due to a combination of reduced cell elongation and division. A QTL on chromosome 1 affects root length responses to cadaverine QTL analysis of root length responses to cadaverine in the Cvi/LerRIL population. (A) Histogram showing root length ratios for the RILs on 100 μM cadaverine compared with control medium. (B) Composite interval mapping analysis for the root length ratio. The top portion of the graph gives the LOD score across each chromosome. The LOD significance threshold is shown as a horizontal line across the graph. The bottom graph shows the additive value toward the phenotype of each genomic region with respect to the Lerallele. (C) Two-dimensional QTL scan for the root length ratio from trial 1. Thex- andy-axes represent positions along each chromosome. The region of the plot below the diagonal gives the additive QTL model, while the region above the diagonal shows epistatic interactions. A scale relating colour to LOD score is provided on the right of the heat map. Numbers on the left of this scale represent LOD scores for the epistatic portion of the plot, whereas those on the right represent scores for the additive model. The arrows indicate the significance thresholds for the epistatic (left) and additive (right) portions of the plot. Near isogenic lines confirm the chromosome 1 QTL Cadaverine root length responses of chromosome 1 NILs and fine mapping. Relative root lengths on media containing 0, 100, and 500 μM cadaverine are shown. Plants were grown at a 30 ° backward tilt for 6 d. The average root length on control medium was set to 1. Absolute average root lengths on control medium were 1.0, 1.2, 1.2, 1.2, 1.1, 1.2, 1.1, and 1.1cm in the lines as shown from left to right. The asterisk indicates the first concentration on which the root length was significantly different from the length on control medium (P<0.05, Student’st-test). Error bars indicate ±SE, andn=18–34. In the diagram of chromosome 1 NILs (bottom), white bars are Lerchromosomal regions, black bars are Cvi regions, and grey bars indicate regions in which the breakpoint is undetermined. The parallel dashed lines flank the probable region of a locus controlling root length responses to cadaverine. Accession breakpoints were determined using primers based on polymorphisms described by Monsanto/CEREON between Columbia and Ler(Janderet al., 2002). Identification of candidate genes for the chromosome 1 QTL Probe sets on chromosome 1 between 25.3Mb and 30.6Mb that show ≥2-fold differential expression between Cvi and Lerat the 95% confidence level Abbreviations: NIL, near isogenic line; OCT, organic cation transporter; RIL, recombinant inbred line. OCT1expression relative to the reference geneAt1G58050is higher in Cvi roots than in Lerroots. Seedlings were grown on 0 μM or 50 μM cadaverine. Error bars indicate ±SE among biological replicates, andOCT1expression for Leron control medium was set to 1. The asterisk indicates a significant difference in expression compared with Lerfor the given condition (P<0.05, Student’st-test). Differences within each accession between cadaverine treatments are not significant. oct1-1mutants express a truncatedOCT1transcript oct1-1shows increased cadaverine sensitivity oct1-1roots are more sensitive to exogenous cadaverine compared with wild-type plants but respond similarly to putrescine-derived polyamines. (A)OCT1expression relative to the reference geneAt1G58050is shown. Error bars indicate ±SE among biological replicates, andOCT1expression for the WS wild type on control medium was set to 1. The asterisk indicates a significant difference in expression compared with the WS wild type (P<0.05, Student’st-test). The abbreviation n.d. indicates that expression was not detected. (B) Plants were grown for 6 d at a 30 ° backward tilt on media containing 0, 50, and 500 μM cadaverine. Root tips were marked after 3 d of growth, and the root growth over the following 3 d was measured for each treatment. Average root growth over the final 3 d on control medium was 1.2cm for the wild type, 1.4cm foroct1-1, 1.3cm for rescue line 1, and 1.4cm for rescue line 2; these lengths were set to 1. For each cadaverine concentration, the letters indicate significant differences in relative root length (P<0.01, pairwise Student’st-tests).n=37–68, and error bars indicate ±SE. (C) Plants were grown for 6 d at a 30 ° backward tilt on media containing various concentrations of polyamines as indicated. Average root length on control medium was 1.3cm for the wild type and 1.4cm for oct1-1; these lengths were set to 1.n=33–44, and error bars indicate ±SE. No significant root length differences were observed for any treatment other than cadaverine (P<0.05, Student’st-test). The WS wild type andoct1-1had similar root lengths on media containing the polyamines putrescine, spermidine, and spermine (Fig. 5C), which shows that this sensitivity is specific to cadaverine. Polyamines have been shown to shorten root growth through the generation of H2O2by diamine and polyamine oxidases, which promotes premature cell differentiation and programmed cell death (Tisiet al., 2011). However, because the cadaverine-hypersensitive response ofoct1-1was specific to cadaverine (Fig. 5C), OCT1 probably functions in a different aspect of polyamine-mediated root growth regulation. The expression level ofOCT1, not its accession origin, correlates with cadaverine sensitivity To determine if differences in theOCT1sequence between Cvi and Leror onlyOCT1expression levels correlated with the cadaverine response,OCT1was cloned from Cvi and Ler, and these constructs were introduced intooct1-1mutants. These transgenic lines were then tested on media containing 0 μM and 50 μM cadaverine, and their relative root lengths were measured. A range of cadaverine resistance levels that did not correlate with the accession source of the transgene was found (Fig. 6A). HigherOCT1expression correlates with cadaverine resistance. OCT1Cviand OCT1Lerindicateoct1-1[OCT1pro:OCT1Cvi] andoct1-1[OCT1pro:OCT1Ler], respectively. (A) Relative root lengths of plants on media containing 0 μM and 50 μM cadaverine. Plants were grown for 6 d at a 30 ° backward tilt. Average root length on control medium was set to 1. Absolute average root length on control medium was 2.2cm for Cvi, 1.9cm for Ler, 2.0cm for WS, 2.0cm foroct1-1, and 1.9, 2.0, 1.7, and 2.1cm for the transgenic lines as shown from left to right. Error bars indicate ±SE, andn=17–24. (B) RootOCT1expression determined by qRT-PCR is shown relative to the reference geneAt1G58050.OCT1expression in Lerwas set to 1. Error bars indicate ±SE among the biological replicates. The abbreviation n.d. indicates that expression was not detected. Because the insertion location can affect transgene expression, it was predicted that theOCT1expression levels would correlate with cadaverine sensitivity. To test this,OCT1expression was measured in four of these lines by qRT-PCR. As expected, a range ofOCT1expression levels was found in the transgenic lines regardless of whether theOCT1untranslated and coding regions came from Cvi or Ler. In general, lines with increased resistance to cadaverine had higherOCT1expression (Fig. 6). Genes other thanOCT1probably also contribute to the cadaverine response OCT1 encodes an organic cation transporter. In animals, OCT proteins take up a wide variety of endogenous compounds and xenobiotics, and, therefore, they affect substrate absorption, distribution, and excretion in many tissues. Most are polyspecific, and transport can occur in either direction (for a review, seeRothet al., 2012).ArabidopsisOCT1 is one of six OCT-like proteins inArabidopsis(Lelandais-Brièreet al., 2007). It was previously reported to localize to the plasma membrane, and promoter–β-glucuronidase (GUS) fusions showed activity in the vasculature of many organs including roots (Lelandais-Brièreet al., 2007;Küfner and Koch, 2008). Because the other six OCT-like proteins localize to the tonoplast rather than the plasma membrane, it is likely that OCT1 has a different function. The present work expands on these studies and suggests a role for OCT1 in affecting root growth responses to cadaverine. Future experiments will be aimed at clarifying the mechanism by which this occurs. One possibility is that OCT1 transports cadaverine away from elongating root cells and through the vasculature, causing it to accumulate in aerial tissues. Alternatively, cadaverine may alter the transport of another molecule through the membranes. Polyamines block many kinds of channels in multiple organisms. For example, spermine and spermidine directly block fast vacuolar cation channels in barley (Bruggemannet al., 1998), and all natural polyamines including cadaverine can regulate cation channel activity through cytoplasmic pathways (Liuet al., 2000;Shabalaet al., 2007). It has been demonstrated that exogenous cadaverine affectsArabidopsisroot morphology and that there is natural variation in this response due in part to varying expression levels ofOCT1. This work has potential implications for better understanding how polyamines contribute to development and mediate stress responses.
