The commercialization of space travel will soon lead to many more people living and working in unique built environments similar to the International Space Station, which is a specialized closed environment that contains its own indoor microbiome. Unintended microbial growth can occur in these environments as in buildings on Earth from elevated moisture, such as from a temporary ventilation system failure. This growth can drive negative health outcomes and degrade building materials. We need a predictive approach for modeling microbial growth in these critical indoor spaces. Here, we demonstrate that even short exposures to varying elevated relative humidity can facilitate rapid microbial growth and microbial community composition changes in dust from spacecraft. We modeled fungal growth in dust from the International Space Station using the time-of-wetness framework with activation and deactivation limited growth occurring at 85% and 100% relative humidity, respectively. Fungal concentrations ranged from an average of 4.4 × 106spore equivalents per milligram of dust in original dust with no exposure to relative humidity to up to 2.1 × 1010when exposed to 100% relative humidity for 2 weeks. As relative humidity and time-elevated increased, fungal diversity was significantly reduced for both alpha (Q< 0.05) and beta (R2= 0.307,P= 0.001) diversity metrics. Bacteria were unable to be modeled using the time-of-wetness framework. However, bacterial communities did change based on constant relative humidity incubations for both beta (R2= 0.22,P= 0.001) and alpha diversity decreasing with increasing moisture starting at 85% relative humidity (Q< 0.05). In the next decade, more people than ever will be working and living in space. This will be fueled in part by the National Aeronautics and Space Agency (NASA) Commercial Low-Earth Orbit Destination initiative that will support private companies such as Starlab Space, LLC, and Blue Origin to build and operate the next generation of space stations [1]. In addition, NASA’sArtemismissions will establish a lunar orbiting space station named Gateway, as well as a surface habitat, which will be the proving ground for technologies needed to live on Mars [2]. One of the best analogs we have available to these future systems is the International Space Station (ISS). The ISS is a unique built environment that is an almost completely closed indoor system continuously inhabited for over 20 years in low-Earth orbit. The ISS contains its own unique microbiome with over 12,000 species identified onboard [3], similar to indoor environments on Earth [4]. These microbes originate from the astronauts, their food, onboard experiments, and other sources [5,6]. Similar to Earth, many microbes reside in the dust [7]. On Earth, indoor dust acts as a sink [8] for microbes and a potential exposure source [9] for occupants in the indoor environment. Dust is also generated onboard the ISS from the daily activities of the crew. The crew must use a vacuum to remove dust from the high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter coverings, which are a part of the air ventilation system, on a weekly basis [10]. The exposure risk for microbes in dust is not well understood in microgravity environments, but it differs from Earth due to the altered particle size distributions in the air and the absence of gravitational settling influences how they deposit in the lungs when inhaled [11–13]. Exposure to fungal growth indoors is associated with negative health outcomes such as asthma and allergies [14,15]. Understanding indoor microbial exposure risks is especially critical in the extreme conditions experienced during spaceflight that compromise the human immune system, potentially exacerbating any negative health effects [16]. Additionally, the unique stressors of a spaceflight environment can cause changes in microbial communities such as increased virulence [17] and antimicrobial resistance [5]. Negative health impacts due to microbial exposure have impacted ISS crew members during flight with symptoms such as rhinitis, skin infections, urinary tract infections, and skin rashes [18]. In addition to astronaut health, preventing microbial growth during spaceflight is important to maintain the structural integrity of the spacecraft as some microbes are able to degrade mission-critical spacecraft materials such as plastics [19], sealants [20], and fibers [21] which can cause premature failure of spacecraft components. Microbial activity onboard has been known to cause issues in essential systems such as biofouling in water lines due to issues in the original design that has since been rectified [22]. In addition, capture of bacterial- and fungal-related airborne particles is a major function of the ISS air filtration system [23]. Increased levels of relative humidity facilitate rapid microbial growth, especially for fungi. Elevated equilibrium relative humidity (ERH) in the air is sufficient to provide enough water availability to microbes to support growth in the dust [8,24,25], which can be predicted even under varying relative humidity conditions using the time-of-wetness framework [26]. These elevated ERH conditions significantly alter community composition and change microbial function in terrestrial house dust [24,25,27]. On the ISS, the current NASA operational guidelines for relative humidity is to maintain it between 25 and 75% [28], but pockets of elevated moisture conditions are possible during the daily operations onboard. Examples include fungal growth on plant experiments onboard due to a ventilation failure that caused high ERH [29], fungal growth on fabric panels where a wet towel was placed [30] on various pieces of equipment used onboard [31], and microbial growth on free-floating condensate on the Russian stationMirin an unused section of the station [32]. However, we do not yet understand if we are able to predict fungal growth in dust from the ISS as can be done on Earth. Dust samples were obtained from four vacuum bags that came from weekly housekeeping activities to clean the protective screen covers for the HEPA filters which are part of the ISS air ventilation system. Samples were returned to Earth, where they were incubated at varying constant ERH conditions (50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 85%, 90%, and 100%) for 2 weeks. In addition, the time-of-wetness framework was used to model microbial growth at elevated (85% ERH) and saturated (100% ERH) conditions. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was used for the quantification of bacteria and fungi for all samples. Illumina MiSeq sequencing was used to determine how microbial communities in the ISS dust changed for each ERH and time-of-wetness condition. In addition, a subset of these samples was observed via scanning electron microscopy to visualize microbial growth directly on the ISS dust samples. All incubation was completed in a sterilized 3.8 L glass chamber and placed in a VWR incubator (Model TFFU20F2QWA Radnor, PA USA) set to 25 °C. Sodium chloride (NaCl) and magnesium chloride (MgCl2) solutions were used to simulate 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 85%, and 90% ERH conditions. Deionized (DI) water alone was used to create 100% ERH conditions. Salt solutions were measured for water activity (aw) using an Aqualab™ Dew Point Water Activity Meter (Decagon 125 Devices Pullman, WA, USA) and adjusted as needed. All incubation chambers contained approximately 50 mL of salt solution or DI for the desired ERH condition and an Onset® HOBO® Data logger (Onset Computer Corporation, Bourne, MA, USA) to monitor ERH and temperature. Dust samples were not sieved and measured out into approximately 25 mg portions that were placed on sterile aluminum foil on a plastic dish. Two-week incubations consisted of triplicate samples for each ISS bag and ERH condition (three samples from each bag per incubation chamber) similar to previous studies [24]. Time-of-wetness incubations followed a procedure previously outlined [25]. Time-of-wetness refers to the time fraction per day when relative humidity conditions are above the 80% threshold [26]. This framework was applied to microbial growth in ISS dust by calculating the relative growth rates at days 5, 10, 14, and 21 at elevated (85% ERH) and saturated (100% ERH) conditions which cycled between 50% ERH for 6, 12, 18, and 24 h during separate incubations. To obtain the relative growth rate (R/k), we first calculated the growth rates (k) for constant (24 h/day) elevated and saturated conditions. Next, the effective growth rates (R) were calculated for each condition (elevated and saturated) at 6-, 12-, and 18-h time points. The relative growth rate was calculated for each bag at each time of wetness first, then these values were averaged to obtain the averaged maximum relative growth rate for each time point and ERH condition. Samples were extracted and quantified on days 5, 10, 14, and 21 after incubation (one 25-mg dust sample per day per bag). All incubation chambers were covered with parafilm to retain ERH conditions and allow CO2to escape. DNA was extracted from all dust samples using a DNeasy Powerlyzer Power Soil Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) with a modified bead mixture (1 g garnet, 0.3 g 100 µm glass beads, and 0.1 g 500 µm beads) to allow for more efficient lysis of cells in the dust substrate [33]. Each DNA extraction run included a blank and was confirmed to contain no microbial DNA. A total of 50 µL of DNA extract was collected for each sample and stored at − 20℃ until use. qPCR was used to determine fungal and bacterial concentrations for all samples with an Applied Biosystems™ QuantStudio™ 6 Flex System (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) using QuantStudio Real-Time PCR Software version 1.3. All samples were diluted to a 50X solution in Tris–EDTA (TE) buffer solution, and triplicate qPCR measurements were made for each sample. For every plate run on qPCR, two wells of template controls were included, and all wells consisted of a 25-µL reaction volume, which included 2 µL of sample. All sequencing for dust samples was performed on an Illumina MiSeq™ at RTL Genomics (Lubbock, TX, USA). All samples were sequenced for fungi, and a smaller subset was sequenced for bacteria. For fungal sequencing, ITS1F (CTTGGTCATTTAGAGGAAGTAA) and ITS2aR (GCTGCGTTCTTCATCGATGC) ribosomal DNA primers were used [38], while the bacteria used 515F (5′-GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTA) and 806R (5′-GGACTACHVHHHTWTCTAAT) primers [39] with 2 × 300 bp sequencing reads. The Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology 2 (QIIME2), version 2021.8, bioinformatics pipeline was used to analyze raw FASTQ sequencing data [40]. For fungi, primers and spacers were trimmed using the Cutadapt [41] plug-in and paired-ends joined using the VSEARCH join-pairs method [42]. Sequences were then trimmed to a Phred score of 30 with three low-quality base windows using the Quality-filter plugin [43]. Fungal sequences were clustered using the vsearch open reference method with UNITE database reference sequences (version 9.0) [44]. Bacterial sequences were run through the Dada2 pipeline [45] and clustered by phylogeny [46]. Beta diversity metrics for fungi were analyzed using Bray–Curtis dissimilarity while bacteria utilized unweighted and weighted UniFrac statistics with a principle coordinate analysis (PCoA) and Adonis function in QIIME2 [47]. Richness and Shannon alpha diversity metrics were calculated for all incubations and significance determined using the Kruskal–Wallis test statistic from QIIME2. The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) version 2.9.0 [48], the User-friendly Nordic Internal Transcribed spacer Ectomycorrhiza (UNITE) 2019 database [49], and Fungal High-throughput Taxonomic tool for use with Next-Generation Sequencing (FHitINGS) [50] version 1.4 was used to identify fungal taxonomy. A note that an updated 2022 version of the UNITE database now exists, and we compared relative abundance data to our analyses of the 2019 database to which no significant differences for our samples were observed. Bacterial taxa were classified in QIIME2 using the feature-classifier plugin [51] which utilized the Greengenes database version 13_8 [52]. All sequencing data has been submitted to NASA’s GeneLab database (GLDS-623) [53]. Microscopy and total organic carbon A subset of dust samples from ISS bag 1 were observed using scanning electron microscopy. Approximately 1.25 mg of dust was placed on black double-sided carbon tape and attached to a SEM sample holder. These samples were then incubated in triplicates for several ERH conditions (50%, 85%, and 100%) for 2 weeks at 25 °C. After incubation, samples were coated with 25 nm of gold and placed in a Apreo™ LoVac Scanning Electron Microscope (Thermo Scientific™ Waltham, MA, USA) for visual observation. Microscopy preparation and analysis were completed at the Center for Electron Microscopy and Analysis (Ohio State University Columbus, OH, USA). In addition, we measured the total soluble organic carbon in the original dust and dust after incubation after 2 weeks at 85% and 100% ERH. A total of four samples were measured at each condition which included one from each bag. Each dust sample was placed into 35 mL of DI in a 50-mL falcon tube. The tubes were placed on a shaker table at 180 rpm for 30 min. After shaking, 30 mL of the solution was extracted and run through a 0.45-µm filter which was then used for analyses. Soluble organic carbon was measured on a Shimadzu TOC-V CSN (VELP Scientific, Inc. Deer Park, NY, USA). Increased relative humidity conditions lead to increased microbial growth Fungal growth concentrations of original dust and after constant equilibrium relative humidity incubations at 50, 60, 70, 80, 85, 90, and 100% ERH at 25℃. Each fungal concentration represents the average value of four vacuum bags which included physical triplicates for each bag and triplicate qPCR concentrations for each sample for a total of 36 measurements per condition. Error bars represent the standard error of fungal quantities for each vacuum bag.*indicate statistically significant growth (P< 0.05) compared to the original dust using Satterthwaite two-samplettest Original dust samples (no incubation or ERH exposure) and dust incubated at 50% ERH for 2 weeks showed no visible signs of microbial growth, in scanning electron microscopy images (Fig.2A,B). At elevated relative humidity conditions of 85% and 100% ERH, we observed indications of active fungal growth on the dust substrate (Fig.2C,D). This included elongated hyphae with conidia production prevalent on almost all dust surfaces, which indicates that fungal reproduction is occurring. In general, more of all of these structures were observed at 100% compared to 85% ERH, similar to other studies with Earth dust and carpet samples [24]. Our previous microscopy analyses in residential carpets also concluded that almost no fungal growth occurred even at high ERH conditions if house dust was not present, indicating the nutrients in dust are essential for active growth [24]. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of ISS dust from the original dust (A) and incubations at 50% ERH (B) show fibrous dust materials, but no fungal growth. Fungal growth including spores, elongated hyphae, and different fungal propagules was observed in ISS dust incubated at 85% ERH (C) and 100% ERH (D) for 2 weeks at 25℃ Total soluble organic carbon was measured in ISS dust samples that included the original dust as well as dust incubated at 85% and 100% ERH for 2 weeks at 25℃ (Fig.3). For each condition, a total of four samples were measured that included one sample per ISS bag collected. In the original dust, total soluble organic carbon ranged from 12.55 to 36.79 mg/L with no significant changes after a 2-week incubation at 85% ERH (10.2–29.05 mg/L,P= 0.52). In contrast, there was a significant reduction in soluble organic carbon after 2-week incubations at 100% ERH (1.76–8.08 mg/L,P= 0.048). This is a soluble organic carbon utilization rate of approximately 1.2 and 0.3 mg soluble carbon per day for 100% and 85% ERH conditions, respectively. From the original ISS dust samples, we measured an average of 22 mg soluble organic carbon per milligram of dust. In comparison, house dust from Earth-based residential homes contains 35 mg of total soluble organic carbon per mg of dust [8]. This indicates that dust from both the ISS and homes on Earth contains significantly more carbon than is required for fungal growth (~ 0.0072 mg soluble carbon/mg dust). Therefore, moisture continues to be the limiting factor for growth. Total soluble organic carbon (TOC) measured in ISS dust in the original dust as well as in dust incubated (25°C) for 2 weeks at 85% and 100% relative humidity conditions. Significant reductions in TOC were observed for 100% conditions but not 85% compared to original dust samples indicating potential fungal use of TOC in ISS dust. Each condition contained four samples (one from each ISS bag in this study), and error bars are the standard deviation of these four bags. * represents a statistically significant (P< 0.05) reduction in total soluble organic carbon compared to original dust samples using Satterthwaite two-samplettest Fungal growth predictions vary based on maximum ERH Fungal time-of-wetness modeling for elevated (85% ERH) and saturated (100% ERH) conditions. Elevated conditions (orange) show an activation-limited growth model, while saturated conditions (green) show a deactivation-limited growth model. Error bars shown represent the standard error between all four ISS bags sampled Microbial diversity changes as ERH conditions are altered We analyzed the fungal and bacterial communities in the samples via DNA amplicon sequencing (Table S10). There was a total of 11,180,519 quality fungal reads and 2,502,228 quality bacterial reads present in all sequenced samples. A total of 107 fungal species and 127 bacterial species were present in at least 10% of samples. The most common fungal genera wereAspergillus(100% of samples),Penicilium(95%), andRhodotorula(94%). The most common fungal species in all samples includedAspergillus sydowii(100%),Aspergillus unguis(100%), andPenicillium chrysogenum(90%). For bacteria,Bacillales(99%),Actinomycetales(99%), andClostridiales(96%) were the most common order and the most common bacterial species wereCorynebacterium kroppenstedtii(81%),Staphylococcus pettenkoferi(78%), andLactobacillus helveticus(74%). Principal coordinate analyses (PCoAs) of beta diversity fungal species present in ISS dust after 2-week incubations at varying ERH conditions (A) and time-of-wetness conditions (B). Both scenarios show as ERH increases (green to red) the fungal species composition is altered Fungal alpha diversity plots for constant ERH, 2-week incubations (A,B), and time of wetness incubations (C,D). For constant incubations, thex-axis represents the original dust and ERH conditions after 2 weeks of incubation (A,B). Time-of-wetness incubations show the time elevated on thex-axis as well as the ERH conditions tested (50% = red, 85% = green, and 100% = blue). Note that 50% of ERH conditions for time-of-wetness samples were only performed at a time elevated of one (24 h per day) Mean relative (A) and absolute (B) abundance data for the fungal genus of time-of-wetness samples. Abundances represent elevated (85%) and saturated (100%) relative humidity conditions at 6-, 12-, 18-, and 24-h time-of-wetness samples as well as unmodified (50%) at 24 h. The mean abundances here represent the average for day 5, 10, 14, and 21 dust samples for each relative humidity and time-of-wetness condition for the four total ISS vacuum bags tested in this study (a total of 12 samples for each ERH/time-of-wetness condition) To date, all microbial studies that have been performed related to spaceflight samples have focused on characterizing what is there including water, surface, dust, and air samples [55–57], but not what happens when moisture becomes elevated and unintended growth occurs. To our knowledge, this is the first study to expose ISS dust to varying moisture conditions to show that increasing ERH alters microbial growth and community composition even for a short period of time. As mentioned above, NASA sets standards for ERH conditions onboard the ISS that ideally stay between 25 and 75% ERH [28]. However, due to the airflow present in the ISS ventilation system, pockets of isolated moisture can occur in certain spots around the station especially during certain activities. For example, astronauts are required to exercise for 2.5 h daily to mitigate the many negative health impacts associated with long-duration spaceflight [58] which creates excess moisture in the form of sweat. Personal hygiene is also a major source of potential elevated moisture exposure while showering, brushing teeth, or washing hands. Additionally, this moisture may originate from the crew dining area during meals or from unintended water release from several plant production systems onboard [59,60]. In microgravity fluids such as water act differently compared to on Earth, such as capillary forces being more dominant on the ISS (microgravity) where Earth is governed by gravitational forces. Due to these many potential sources of daily elevated moisture conditions, it is critical to understand how fungal and bacterial communities in spacecraft dust will react when receiving ideal growth conditions, namely water availability, and how this can affect crew health, spacecraft integrity, and planetary protection plans.
