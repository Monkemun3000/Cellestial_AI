Subject Areas:Immunology, Space Sciences Murine immune profiles from simulated deep spaceflight conditions were analyzed Immune profiling revealed unique immune diversity with each experimental condition Plasma microRNA sequence analysis revealed involvement in immune system dysregulation Astronaut data showed elevated inflammation during low-Earth orbit missions Recent studies indicate astronauts in low-Earth orbit (LEO), such as on the International Space Station (ISS), experience immune dysfunction, for instance, redox imbalance, elevated inflammation, elevated granulocytes, inhibited lymphocyte proliferation, and reduced lymphocyte functions (Crucian et al., 2015;Douda et al., 2015;Leliefeld et al., 2016;Martinez et al., 2015;Mehta et al., 2017;Pecaut et al., 2017). However, less is known about the likely biological (immune system) consequences of deep space exploration. Solar particle event (SPE) and galactic cosmic ray (GCR) irradiation are charged particle ionizing types of radiation that will impact humans and spacecraft during lunar and deep spaceflight missions (Sridharan et al., 2020). High doses of these types of charged ionizing radiation types do not typically pose a threat to Earth, as we are shielded by the Earth's magnetosphere (Simonsen et al., 2020); however, astronauts on future missions to the lunar surface and Mars will have limited shielding from these damaging irradiation. Although doses experienced in deep space do not parallel those of LEO manned missions, health risks associated with LEO doses are still considerable. For instance, current missions in LEO, such as on the ISS, experience a low total absorbed dose of irradiation, estimated to be exposed to approximately 0.10–0.52 mGy/day, depending on the mission, as quantified by NASA GeneLab's environmental data for spaceflight experiments (Miller, 2020). SPE irradiation originates from protons being emitted during solar flares and coronal mass ejections (Narici et al., 2018;Sanzari et al., 2015), and although the majority of the ions are protons at different energies during these events, it can also include other ions such as helium and high- (H) atomic number (Z) and energy (E) ions (Hu, 2017). Limited number of human reports following SPE irradiation exposure are associated with astronauts on LEO spacewalks and lunar missions from the Apollo era (Romero-Weaver et al., 2013;Sanzari et al., 2013). The physiological effects of SPE irradiation exposure include fatigue, acute radiation sickness, long-term skin damage, elevated cytokine storms, and decreased blood and hemopoietic cell numbers (Romero-Weaver et al., 2013;Sanzari et al., 2013). GCR irradiation is emitted from the sun, stars, and energetic objects such as supernova (Nelson, 2016) and consists of high-energy protons, helium nuclei, and high-energy high-charge (HZE) ions with intrinsic masses (for example, iron, silicon, oxygen, and carbon) (Nelson, 2016). As the predicted dose for ISS missions, in the absence of SPE irradiation events, is 0.10–0.52 mGy/day (Miller, 2020), astronauts in LEO could therefore be exposed up to a roughly estimated 0.1 Gy/year of irradiation. Moreover, during SPE events, astronauts could experience an extremely high dose of protons (Hu, 2017) possibly up to 1 Gy or more (Wu et al., 2009), which would pose significant health risks. NASA estimates that the amount of GCR irradiation exposure during deep space missions may be 0.3–0.6 mGy/day or more over a 3-year-long mission to Mars (0.245–0.360 Gy) (Nelson, 2016). Linear energy transfer (LET) is defined as the amount of energy that is deposited or transferred in a material from an ion (Chancellor et al., 2018). High-LET irradiation can cause more damaging ionizing tracks and pose a higher relative biological effectiveness (RBE) risk compared to low-LET irradiation (Niemantsverdriet et al., 2012). However, this does not rule out the composite effects of low-LET continuous dose/dose rate involved during spaceflight (Cekanaviciute et al., 2018;Saha et al., 2014), the effects of low LET inhibition of angiogenesis (Grabham et al., 2013), or the range of cellular damage by low-LET particles (Nelson, 2016). RBE is the relative amount of biological damage a dose of irradiation will have on tissue (Chancellor et al., 2018). Thus, identifying the immune responses following distinct ionizing irradiation types, along with described dosing schemes, RBEs, and protracted exposures, are essential for future exploration missions to the lunar surface and Mars. Due to limitations of performing deep space missions, there have been multiple ground-based research studies examining the effects of ionizing irradiation on immunity. For instance, large disparities in immune population subtypes, in particular lymphocytes (Fernandez-Gonzalo et al., 2017;Gridley and Pecaut, 2011;Gridley et al., 2002;Romero-Weaver et al., 2013;Sanzari et al., 2013) and induction of inflammation (Baselet et al., 2019;Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019;Li et al., 2014;Teresa Pinto et al., 2016), have been reported. However, more information is required on the deep space-relevant spectra of irradiation effects on immunity. With recent advancements in simulated GCR and SPE dosing schemes at NASA's Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) within Brookhaven National Laboratory, the biological effects of realistic deep space exposures can now be successfully measured in ground-based studies (Simonsen et al., 2020). Therefore, our study sought to investigate the immediate-early immune effects following acute simulated GCR and SPE irradiation, singly or in combination with simulated microgravity (hindlimb unloading, HU) in mice. We hypothesized that unique immune signatures and microRNA (miRNA) profiles would be produced by distinct experimental conditions of simulated GCR, SPE, and gamma irradiation, singly or in combination with HU. Although this study focuses on immune dysregulation during deep spaceflight, the knowledge gained from these studies can be applied to related issues on Earth such as, cancer radiotherapy, muscle degeneration, and immune-related diseases.

Elevated Inflammation in Astronauts on ISS Missions in LEO Characterization of biomarkers of inflammation during spaceflight is critical for understanding human adaptation to spaceflight. Although ionizing irradiation exposures in LEO are not at the same as doses experienced in deep space, health risks associated with these doses are still considerable, and career limiting. To characterize inflammation experienced on orbit, we re-purposed retrospective data from ISS crewmembers participating in three experiments: Nutritional Status Assessment (2006–2012), Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect Against Changes in Bone Metabolism During Space Flight and Recovery (Pro K) (2010–2015), and Biochemical Profile (2013–2018). Subsets of these data have been previously published (Crucian et al., 2014;Smith et al., 2015). Elevated Markers of Inflammation in Astronauts on 4- to 6-Month ISS Missions Blood samples were collected at launch minus (L-) 45 days, on Flight Day (FD)15, FD30, FD60, FD120, and FD180; post-flight samples were collected in the first 24 h after landing and again 30 days later . Inflammatory markers were analyzed in plasma for IGF-1, IL-1β, IL-1α, and IL-1RA. Repeated measures analysis of variance was conducted to test for differences during and after flight compared with preflight, and comparisons among time points were made using a Bonferroni t test. Multiple comparisons were accounted for. Data represent means ± SEM (∗∗∗p < 0.001, n = 59 crewmembers; 47 males, 12 females). Subsets of these data have been previously published (Crucian et al., 2014;Smith et al., 2015). Utilizing the recently developed simplified version of the NASA consensus formula of five different ions to simulate GCR and SPE irradiation at NSRL, our study sought to investigate the immediate-early immune effects following acute simulated deep space exposures of ionizing irradiation, singly or in combination with simulated microgravity in mice. We also sought to describe the contributing role of circulating miRNAs on the immune profile, as miRNAs have been identified as regulators of immunity (Baker et al., 2019;Danger et al., 2014;Mehta and Baltimore, 2016;Montagner et al., 2013;O'Brien et al., 2018;O'Connell et al., 2010;Tsitsiou and Lindsay, 2009). Known effects of ionizing irradiation can cause immunogenic responses (Baselet et al., 2019;Li et al., 2014;Teresa Pinto et al., 2016). Indeed, high-LET irradiation causes more damaging tracks and elevates apoptosis, compared to low-LET irradiation (Niemantsverdriet et al., 2012). Yet, comprehensive immune studies on the effects of acute high- and low-LET irradiation are limited (Gridley and Pecaut, 2006). Therefore, characterizing immune profiles and circulating miRNAs following distinct ionizing irradiation types are essential for successful missions to the lunar surface and Mars. Innate immune populations were also evaluated. For one, SPE irradiation alone resulted in significant elevation of eosinophils (Figure 2D) and NK/NKT cell (Figure 3D) percentages, compared to NL-Sham controls. Interestingly, ionizing irradiation can cause cardiovascular complications (Puukila et al., 2017), while elevated NK cells (Ong et al., 2017) and eosinophils (Séguéla et al., 2015) can contribute to these pathologies. Gamma irradiation alone resulted in a significant elevation in monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, and NK/NKT cell percentages, compared with NL-Sham controls (Figures 2B–2D andFigure 3D), suggesting distinct immune profiles are generated between different ionizing irradiation types. Indeed, gamma irradiation had considerable effects on innate immune cell recruitment into blood circulation, compared with GCR and SPE irradiation, indicating different mechanisms of immunogenicity following irradiation damage, which may be a factor of the high dose of gamma irradiation. Indeed, overall cell numbers were reduced within all radiation exposures, compared to NL-Sham controls, indicating the damaging effects of ionizing irradiation on the immune system (Figures 1F, 1G, andS1). However, for the purpose of establishing the RBE in this study, gamma was used at a higher dose to make comparisons between charged particles (GCR, SPE) and photons (gamma). In addition, there are qualitative differences between the biological effects of each, such that gamma irradiation serves as a useful high-ionization control. Interestingly, all four innate populations studied are inflammation-producing cells upon activation and were suppressed when gamma irradiation was combined with HU, indicating the potential for inhibited inflammation. Similar impairment was observed in SPE irradiation in combination with HU groups in terms of reduced eosinophil (Figure 2D) and NK/NKT cell percentages (Figure 3D). As such, a reduced number of select innate immune cells 24 h following distinct irradiation treatments in combination with simulated microgravity, may be a result of impaired innate immune cell recruitment. In addition, miRNA immune GO term analyses indicated a general reduction in myeloid cell differentiation and FcR-mediated signaling in all exposure groups, suggesting distinct biological pathways involved in phagocytosis (Koenderman, 2019) are suppressed during simulated deep space exposures (Figure 7A). Collectively, impairment in both leukocyte recruitment and phagocytic function can result in inefficient innate responses against challenges, i.e., microbial or viral. In line with this, astronauts on board the ISS experience immune dysregulation and heightened infections (Cervantes and Hong, 2016;Crucian et al., 2015;Mehta et al., 2017;Nash, 2000), which may be a result of poor immunogenic innate immune responses and recruitment. However, further studies with these distinct deep space-relevant exposures, circulating miRNAs, and cell types are required. We further assessed lymphocyte surface receptor expression of IL-7R. As described above, IL-7R is expressed on naive T cells, but not activated T cells, and then is re-expressed on memory T cells (Mazzucchelli and Durum, 2007). Indeed, IL-7R MFI was reduced in GCR irradiation combined with HU, compared to NL-Sham controls, suggesting T cell activation (Figure 5C). In line with this,Il7Rknockout mice have significantly reduced developmental T and B cells, and are similar phenotypically as SCID mice, which are immunocompromised (Peschon et al., 1994). This may somewhat explain overall reduced lymphocyte populations following simulated spaceflight exposures, along with reduced thymic and splenic weights, as well. Interestingly, miR-199a and miR-142–3p targetIl7R(Luo and Fu, 2018), reducing its expression levels; however, in our report, mechanisms of this requires further investigation. Conversely, elevated IL-7R has been linked to multiple inflammatory diseases (Anderson et al., 2011;Belarif et al., 2018;Willis et al., 2012). For example, blocking IL-7R inhibited JAK/STAT, ERK, and PI3K signaling of IFN-γ from memory cytotoxic T cells, limiting chronic inflammation (Belarif et al., 2018). In line with this, miRNA Hallmark terms displayed general reduction of PI3K/AKT signaling and inflammatory response pathways across all simulated deep space exposures, indicating miRNA involvement in suppression of these pathways (Figure 7B). Alternatively, HU-Sham groups had elevated IL-7R MFI, which suggests elevated inflammation. Indeed, miRNA Hallmark terms displayed elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) across all exposure groups, and HU-Sham controls displayed heightened ROS expression levels (Figure 7B). Heightened ROS can cause inflammation both in spaceflight and on Earth (Crucian et al., 2018;Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019;Nguyen et al., 2017), which may be an associated mechanism involved during heightened inflammation in the HU-Sham groups. Therefore, IL-7R, along with neutrophil counts (Figure 2C), NLR (Figure 5E),Il-6expression (Figure 6C), and ROS Hallmark terms regulated by miRNAs (Figure 7B) are all elevated in HU-Sham mice, further supporting inflammatory outcomes following prolonged microgravity. In line with this, ISS LEO crew member data displayed inflammation via elevated IL-1β and IL-1α compared with pre-flight controls (Figure 8,Table S1). Importantly, these molecules were induced early (day 15) during spaceflight, whereby the effects of ionizing irradiation exposures would have been minimal (Figure 8,Table S1), confirming inflammation is induced in LEO astronauts, similar to our ground HU model. Deep spaceflight exposures present immunologically complicated outcomes. Synergistic inflammatory or immunogenic responses were variable in some, but not all, measurements, and in some cases were non-productive. Furthermore, circulating miRNAs (cell-to-cell transfer via exosomes) (Montagner et al., 2013;Schwarzenbach and Gahan, 2019) contribute to unique immune profiles, therefore miRNAs may be important for immune-targeted therapies. Although not studied in this report, added complexities involving combined types of ionizing irradiation, as well as protracted versus acute irradiation exposures that would also be experienced during deep spaceflight, are necessary to consider in future studies. Furthermore, only a small snippet into the immune response was assessed in this study; therefore, longitudinal responses and functional consequences are also required in future studies. Nonetheless, we found distinct immune profiles and miRNA signatures are produced by each irradiation exposure group, singly or in combination with HU in mice. Therefore, selective countermeasures targeting distinct immune responses in crew members may be required during long-duration exploratory missions to the lunar surface and Mars. In this study, we report the immune and miRNA differentials of mice following ground-based simulations of deep spaceflight, along with analyses of crew member inflammation in LEO. As this study utilized ground-based simulations in mice, deep spaceflight comparisons would be required to confirm similar profiles. Additionally, interpretation of whole-blood transcriptomics to specific cell types is limited in this study; however, these data provide insight into the overall cytokine profile induced by each condition that is independent of cell frequency. Furthermore, the contribution of miRNAs to the generated immune populations is described; however, an understanding into mechanism and/or functional outcomes would fully elucidate their role to overall immunity. In addition, the time point of collections was at an immediate response, yet the long-term response would also be of benefit, in particular, for long-duration missions. Finally, the comparisons between the immune differentials in mice and humans is a limitation; however, this study can give some insight into the significant immune population changes (i.e., T cytotoxic lymphocytes) that can be studied in humans during deep spaceflight mission in the near future.
