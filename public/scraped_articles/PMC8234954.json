This article is an open access article distributed under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Ionizing radiation present in extraterrestrial environment is an important factor that affects plants grown in spaceflight. Pearson correlation-based gene regulatory network inferencing from transcriptional responses of the plantArabidopsis thalianaL. grown in real and simulated spaceflight conditions acquired by GeneLab, followed by topological and spectral analysis of the networks is performed. Gene regulatory subnetworks are extracted for DNA damage response processes. Analysis of radiation-induced ATR/ATM protein–protein interactions inArabidopsisreveals interaction profile similarities under low radiation doses suggesting novel mechanisms of DNA damage response involving non-radiation-induced genes regulating other stress responses in spaceflight. The Jaccard similarity index shows that the genes AT2G31320, AT4G21070, AT2G46610, and AT3G27060 perform similar functions under low doses of radiation. The incremental association Markov blanket method reveals non-radiation-induced genes linking DNA damage response to root growth and plant development. Eighteen radiation-induced genes and sixteen non-radiation-induced gene players have been identified from the ATR/ATM protein interaction complexes involved in heat, salt, water, osmotic stress responses, and plant organogenesis. Network analysis and logistic regression ranking detected AT3G27060, AT1G07500, AT5G66140, and AT3G21280 as key gene players involved in DNA repair processes. High atomic weight, high energy, and gamma photon radiation result in higher intensity of DNA damage response in the plant resulting in elevated values for several network measures such as spectral gap and girth. Nineteen flavonoid and carotenoid pigment activations involved in pigment biosynthesis processes are identified in low radiation dose total light spaceflight environment but are not found to have significant regulations under very high radiation dose environment. Space is an environment that may have harmful effects on living organisms due to its hostile characteristics such as low oxygen, microgravity, lower pressure, and radiation. Radiation is the emission of energy as electromagnetic waves or as moving subatomic particles, especially high-energy particles. Radiation is of two types: non-ionizing and Ionizing Radiation (IR). The radiation experienced in low Earth orbit is primarily low Linear Energy Transfer (LET) present in the International Space Station (ISS). Organisms in space are exposed to radiation, which affects the health of humans and the anatomy and growth of plants and animals [1]. Space missions have to deal with IR in current spacecraft and future long-term deep-space missions [2]. Plants are affected by radiation resulting in damage to cellular components and damage to Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) [3]. Exposure to radiation causes DNA lesions in plant cells such as single-stranded breaks, Double Strand Breaks (DSB), mismatches, and modified bases. This leads to DNA Damage Response (DDR) that includes signal transduction, triggering either DNA repair, cell survival, or cell death [4]. The plantArabidopsis thaliana(Arabidopsis) is a member of the mustard family widely used as a model organism in plant biology for studies of the cellular and molecular biology of flowering plants. It has a rapid life cycle of about six weeks from germination to mature plants. It can be easily cultivated in restricted space, has a small genome, a large number of mutant lines, extensive genetic maps, and genomic resources. Hence, it has been chosen as a model organism for spaceflight studies by research communities [5,6]. Similar to observations made on terrestrial plant stressors, spaceflight missions have made extensive observations and collected transcriptional gene regulatory datasets ofArabidopsis[7]. Plants have evolved genes that participate in DNA repair pathways that help the plant to survive the effects of radiation. Exposure to IR inArabidopsishas shown a decrease in DNA methylation with no effect on morphology or root growth or seed germination [8]. Ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR) and Ataxia-Telangiectasia Mutate (ATM) areArabidopsishomologs of the human ATR and ATM genes, which are activated by DNA single and double-stranded breaks in eukaryotes [9]. ATM-dependent transcriptional changes inArabidopsisdue to IR and its influence on root growth are discussed in [10]. Two mutants ofArabidopsisdefective in the ATR and ATM protein kinases have shown hypersensitivity to radiation resulting in the upregulation of hundreds of genes, while both ATR and ATM mutants responded with transcriptional changes to DNA damage due to radiation [11]. The effect of acute radiation onArabidopsisgrowth and its impact on protein-coding genes is presented in [12]. Apart from DDR, plants adopt pigment biosynthesis processes to protect them against Ultraviolet (UV) radiation. These pigments are flavonoids, betalains, and carotenoids. Flavonoids provide a range of color from pale-yellow to blue and belong to the class of phenylpropanoids [13]. Carotenoids contain up to 15 conjugated double bonds [14]. It has been shown that light induces expression of carotenoid genes during leaf, flower development, and fruit ripening inArabidopsis[15]. Carotenoids protect the plant against excessive light and add color to the flowers, fruits, and seeds [16]. 163 ATR/ATM genes inArabidopsishave been shown experimentally as responding to ionizing radiation in [11]. We call these ATR/ATM genes radiation-induced genes and other downstream genes of stress signaling non-radiation-induced genes [17]. There is no putative radiation subnetwork analysis for detecting radiation and non-radiation induced genes that are involved in biological processes related to radiation response in the plant. In this paper, we are analyzing the effects of low LET radiation onArabidopsisfound in low Earth orbit experienced by current spaceflight missions STS-129 and SpaceX. As long term spaceflight missions beyond the shielding effects of Earth’s atmosphere and magnetic field are contemplated, we also analyze the effects of two different types of IR onArabidopsis: gamma photons, which have low rates of linear energy transfer (LET), and relativistic Fe nuclei (here termed HZE), a high LET form of IR [18]. The regulation of the Carotenoid Biosynthesis Process (CBP) at the transcriptional level is important for the production of plant hormones, photosynthesis, and dispensing of seeds. In this paper, we investigate CBP regulation in the spaceflight environment, as well. As modules are more informative for the regulatory mechanism of a biological process [19], we perform module-based analysis and have identified radiation and non-radiation induced gene/protein interactions in DNA repair processes, as well as flavonoids and carotenoids that respond to light environment in spaceflight. We call these modules subnetworks. Thehypothesisof this research is: if subnetworks of radiation-induced biological processes are extracted, then hub genes and target (authority) genes including non-radiation induced genes can be identified, because network analysis detects and ranks hub genes and authority genes. Furthermore, topological and algebraic spectral network analysis enables the comparison of the subnetworks for different doses of radiation, revealing similarities and differences in the regulation of these processes. GLDS-7: the dataset contains microarray gene expression data from the tissues (roots, leaves, and hypocotyls) of the plantArabidopsis Wassilewskija(WS) andColumbia(Col-0) ecotypes grown in spaceflight and ground control [21]. Ground control experiments were conducted using identical ABRS hardware and an environmental chamber programmed to International Space Station (ISS) environmental conditions. The data contains 20,000 genes with five expression values per component. GLDS-120 dataset contains the transcriptomics data of theArabidopsisWS and Col-0 ecotypes, and the genePhytochrome D(phyD) mutant of ecotype Col-0. The different stressors imposed on the plants are light and dark in spaceflight, and light and dark on the ground. Gene expression data are available for pairs of combinations of genotypes and ecotypes [22,23]. The GLDS-7 and GLS-120 datasets were collected under a low dose of radiation, with an average absorbance of 1.25 milliGray (mGY) and an average absorbance of 1.655 mGY for low-LET (SAA), and an average cumulative absorbed dose of 1.86 mGY. GLDS-37 dataset contains the transcriptomic data of four different ecotypes ofArabidopsisin spaceflight microgravity and on the ground: Col-0, LER-2, WS-2, and Cvi-0. The seeds of the mentioned ecotypes are germinated in orbit and grown for eight days [24]. Ground control data is collected under the same environmental stressors. RNAseq is performed to analyze the transcriptomic changes of the ecotypes. GLDS-38 dataset contains proteomics and transcriptomics data of theArabidopsisseedlings. The seeds were flown in the International Space Station (ISS) and allowed to germinate and grow for three days in microgravity [25].ArabidopsisWild Type Col-0 seeds were plated onto twenty-two 60 mm Petri plates, loaded into PDFUs, and inserted 4 Biological Research in Canisters (BRICs). The GLDS 37 dataset was collected under a low radiation dose with a cumulative absorbed dose of 1.06 mGY. The GLDS-38 data was collected under a low radiation dose with a cumulative absorbed dose of 0.38 mGY. The above four datasets correspond to radiation exposure in low Earth orbit spaceflights. GLDS-46 dataset was collected under HZE (1 Giga electron Volt (GeV) Fe26+high mass, high charge, and high energy relativistic particles) and photons (γR) which have low rates of Linear Energy Transfer (LET) onArabidopsisseedlings. Both types of radiation showed DSB damage response. This dataset was collected under a very high dose of 100 Gy at a dose rate of 1.8 Gy/min. A 100 Gy radiation dose inArabidopsiswould generate the same number of DSBs as a 4Gy dose in humans. We are interested in this dataset because of foreseen long-term manned missions beyond the Earth’s atmosphere and magnetic field to the moon and Mars [18]. 2.2. Gene Regulatory Network Inferencing Using Pearson Correlation We define a graph-based representation for the gene expressions. Formally, a graph is a pair of sets G:= (V,E) where |V| is the set of vertices (molecules, genes, proteins, nodes, points) and |E| is the set of edges, which is an ordered pair of V. The graph (V, E, o, t) is called directed, if directed edges are allowed, i.e., not all edges have reverse edges as members of E. In a directed graph G = (V,E,o,t), the edges e = (u,v), the origin of e is denoted by o and the terminal v is denoted by t(v). The Pearson’s correlation coefficient between two variables (genes, nodes) is defined as the covariance of the two variables (x and y) divided by the product of their standard deviations. Gene expression values ranging from three to eight for each gene are used to compute Pearson correlation. The expression values are linearly related, hence Pearson correlation is used [26]. We have applied Pearson correlation network analysis to identify key gene players for cell wall biosynthesis, and root growth inArabidopsisin spaceflight using the gene expression values from GLDS-7 and GLDS-120 datasets [27]. The Pearson correlation coefficient is used as the measure of correlation (between −1 to 1) and gene pairs are considered co-expressed if theirp-value is less than or equal to the corrected thresholdp-value. Thet-test is used to establish if the correlation coefficient is significantly different from zero, and, hence there is evidence of an association between the two variables. The genes are treated as nodes and the relation between them is an edge. Therefore, the genes with the highest degree are related to a higher number of target or authority genes. Those genes that have the highest degree or intramodule (within graph) connectivity are treated as hub genes to construct the gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Vertices (u,v) are the edges (arcs), respectively [28]. A graph is weighted if each edge e is assigned a real-valued weight w. In our approach, the weights of the edges between two nodes (genes) are the correlation values. 2.3. Causal Relations Discovery Using Incremental Association Markov Blanket (IAMB) Method The method used for causal relation inferencing here is the Markov Blankets (MB) method and Bayesian Network (BN) learning [31,32,33,34]. Joint conditional probabilities are represented by a graph in a Bayesian network, the nodes (genes) are connected by the Markov property which states that a node is conditionally independent of its nondescendants, given its parents. Applying the faithfulness condition, the IAMB of any node (gene) in a BN is the set of parents, children, and spouses (the other parents of their common children) of the gene [32]. We determine the direct causes of a gene’s upregulation, the effects on a gene or a protein due to the upregulation of the gene, as well as the upregulation of the causes of the activation of the gene. In our case, each gene is a variable with a series of expression values. The Markov blanket of a gene X is the smallest set MB(X) containing all genes carrying information about X that cannot be obtained from any other gene. The MB(X) of a node (gene) X includes its parents, children, and spouses which are the strongly relevant genes to gene X; that is, of genes that support and are associated with the target gene (X). Association measures and conditional independent tests are applied to identify the strongly relevant genes [35,36]. Hence, MB(T) is a causal structure learning algorithm useful for the discovery of regulatory interactions among genes from gene expression data. 2.4. Computation of Network Measures The network measures include spectral gap, girth or diameter, density, connected components, and Jaccard similarity [28,37,38]. These are used to compare the subnetworks for each of the processes. Spectral gap: For a graph G, the Laplacian eigenvalues can be ordered as 1 = |λ1| ≥ |λ2|≥ · · · ≥|λn| (G may be directed or undirected, weighted or unweighted, simple or not). The Spectral gap is defined as: δλ= |λ1| − |λ2|. By normalizing the Laplacian matrix of G, the eigenvalues are λ1≥ λ2≥ · · · ≥ λn > 0, and the Laplacian spectral gap will be: δλ= 1 − |λ2|. The spectral gap is also known as a random walk, in terms of this concept λ2is the most important eigenvalue. Note that if the spectral gap is 0, which means λ2= 1 (Γ is not (strongly) connected or if Γ is bipartite), this means a typical random walk will not converge to a unique distribution or dominant eigenvector. As long as the spectral gap is greater than 0, which means |λ2| < 1, then the random walk converges to a unique dominant eigenvector, and the spectral gap measures the rate of convergence, the larger the spectral gap (the smaller|λ2|), the better the network flow (large h(G), diffusion, mixing, random walk, expansion, sparsity, and other highly desirable properties of the network G). Girth of a graph is the smallest positive integerrsuch that Trace(Ar) > 0. Let d = d(G) be the smallest integer (if it exists) so that for every pair of vertices (u,v) there is a walk of length at most d from u to v. Then d(G) is called thediameteror maximum eccentricity of the graph G. Density of a graph is the ratio between the number of edges and the number of possible edges. Density is a measure of the compactness of a module (subnetwork) and measures the connectivity strength of pairs of genes in the module [19]. Connected component in a directed graph is a subgraph in which any two vertices are connected by paths, and which is connected to no additional vertices in the super graph. Jaccard similarity index is used to quantify the neighborhood similarity between two vertices (genes), it is also called topological similarity [39]. The Jaccard index calculates the proportion of v-type genes between two u-type genes, relative to the total number of v-type genes connected to either u-type genes [40]. An index of 1 indicates the exact similarity between u and v, while 0 indicates no similarity between the two sets. The above measures are computed for the subnetworks. If the Jaccard similarity is 0.5, it indicates that half of the genes in one subnetwork are also found in the other subnetwork. Furthermore, hub genes of subnetworks are compared using the degree distribution and subgraph centrality measures. Degree distribution is the number of neighbors connected to a node; in other words, it is the number of edges incident on a node. The degree distribution can give information about the structure of a network. The networks can be directed or undirected. In the undirected case, the degree of nodeiis the number of connections it has, and it can be represented as an adjacency matrix, with the sum over all nodes. For directed graphs, there are two types of degree distributions: in-degree, which is the number of connections entering the node, and out-degree, which is the number of outgoing connections. The degree distribution for a directed graph is the fraction of vertices of degree kinand kout. In this case, the degree distribution is computed for the hub genes in the four low radiation dose subnetworks. Subgraph Centrality of a node is a weighted sum of closed walks of different lengths in the network starting and ending at a node. Centrality measures are used widely in biological networks to infer protein-protein interactions and identify essential proteins [41,42,43]. 2.5.

Logistic Regression Ranking of Hub Genes The subgraph centrality, closeness centrality, degree distribution, page rank, and eigenvalue centrality network measures are used by the logistic regression method to rank the top correlated genes from the Pearson GRNs. Apart from the hub genes for the subnetworks, the other top-ranked radiation-induced genes from the low radiation dose subnetworks are AT3G21280 (UBP7), AT1G07500 (SMR5), and AT5G66140 (PAD2). Logistic regression of the top correlated genes in the HZE and γR subnetworks resulted in all of the high ranked genes being radiation-induced ATR/ATM genes. No non-radiation-induced genes are among the top 50 ranked genes for the very high radiation dose subnetworks. 3.9.

ATR/ATM Gene Interactions Key ATR/ATM radiation-induced genes identified from the DDR process subnetworks. Key non-radiation-induced genes interacting with ATR/ATM radiation induced genes. The ATR/ATM radiation-induced genes respond to DNA damage and/or ionizing radiation in concert with non-radiation-induced genes that respond to other environmental stressors such as ROS, salt, light, heat, and water changes in spaceflight. The MB causal relational subnetworks show the ATR/ATM genes related with genes that regulate root development, and plant growth, indicating that increased radiation tolerance by genetic activations may have a side effect on the plant growth. This fact has to be considered while genetically engineering plants for DNA repair response which may have undesired side-effects such as reduced yield. Further experiments are necessary to study the effect of long-term exposure of plants to space radiation and the best mechanisms to overcome the harmful effects of radiation. The overexpression of several genes and their side effects may be averted by suitable enclosures that can shield the plant from spaceflight radiation. We have applied advanced network analysis and machine learning approaches to detect key genes involved in DDR and their links with genes involved in spaceflight stress responses inArabidopsis. Our analysis shows that the DDR processes are intermixed with the regulation of critical functions necessary for the plant to adapt to the spaceflight environment. There is a significant difference in the regulation of these processes in a low radiation dose environment where ATR/ATM radiation-induced genes interact with many downstream genes, whereas in the very high HZE and γR radiation dose environment, the DDR processes are regulated chiefly by ATR/ATM genes.
