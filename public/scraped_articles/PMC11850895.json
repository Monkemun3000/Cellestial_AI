  "content": "Glutathione triggers leaf-to-leaf, calcium-based plant defense signaling Received 2024 Jun 19; Accepted 2025 Feb 14; Collection date 2025. Animals rely on nervous systems to cope with environmental variability, whereas plants are characterized by lack of nervous system but still have evolved systemic communication systems through signaling molecules that trigger long-distance defense signaling events when encountered with environmental challenges. Here, our genetic screening of the previously constructed hairpin RNA-basedArabidopsislibrary identifies a glutathione (GSH)-deficient mutant that has high accumulation of glutamate (Glu), a previously defined wound signal essential for activating plant defense, but disharmoniously exhibits attenuation of defense signaling events. We further uncover GSH as a critical signaling molecule that relies on GLUTAMATE RECEPTOR-LIKE 3.3 (GLR3.3) to trigger long-distance calcium-based defense signaling events in plants. Our findings offer new insights into highly sophisticated systemic defense systems evolved by plants to defend against herbivory and pathogen invasion. Subject terms:Herbivory, Biotic, Wounding Li et al. identified GSH as a signaling molecule that triggers wound-induced systemic [Ca2 +]cyttransmission, activates JA biosynthesis, and regulates plant defense responses, highlighting the complex mechanisms of plant systemic defense signaling. Animals rely on well-developed nervous systems to dexterously take prompt movements and rapidly facilitate long-range information exchange in front of the changing environment. In mammalian nervous systems, many different types of chemical substances, including amino acids (e.g., glutamate), monoamines (e.g., dopamine, norepinephrine), acetylcholine, peptides (e.g., substance P), serve as neurotransmitters to bind their corresponding receptors, then activate ion channels, and consequently produce ion flux1, thereby inducing membrane potential changes that lead to signal propagation for neurotransmission1–4. Plants are characterized by lack of a nervous system but still have the ability to systematically communicate the environmental signals from the site of perception to the distal tissues5. In response to herbivorous insect attack or wounding at local leaves, wound signaling molecules are released at the damaged plant cells, and may bind corresponding receptors to trigger propagation of slow wave potentials (SWPs)6–9, initiate transmission of cytoplasmic calcium ([Ca2+]cyt)10–15, and consequently activate biosynthesis of defensive phytohormone jasmonic acid (JA), thereby mediating expression of defense-responsive genes for systemic defense responses in plants7,8,11,12,16–18. Many different types of chemical substances were revealed as neurotransmitters that induce long-distance ionic responses to effectively mediate neurotransmission in mammals4. However, in plant kingdom, only an amino acid and a protein, namely the glutamate (Glu) and the recently discovered “Ricca’s factor” β-THIOGLUCOSIDE GLUCOHYDROLASE (TGG) are so far defined as wound signals that depend on glutamate receptor-like (GLR) protein, the homologous protein of mammalian ionotropic Glu receptors (iGluRs), to activate systemic plant defense response6,7,11. In this study, our genetic screening of the previously constructed hairpin RNA-basedArabidopsislibrary19identified a glutathione (GSH)-deficient mutant that highly accumulated Glu, the previously defined molecule crucial for activation of plant defense, but disharmoniously exhibited attenuation of defense signaling events. We further uncovered GSH as a critical signaling molecule that relies on GLR3.3 to trigger long-distance propagation of calcium-based defense signaling events.

Taken together, the above-mentioned data suggest that GSH might serve as an important wound signal that triggers wound-induced systemic [Ca2+]cyttransmission, activates JA biosynthesis, and regulates plant defense responses.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file. The successful transmission of neural signals from one cell to another in animals relies on the mutual conversion of chemical signals (neurotransmitters) and electrical signals, where ion fluxes are induced by neurotransmitters and the release of neurotransmitters is dependent on electrical signals1,2,42. In contrast, little is known about how signaling substances are transmitted in plants to activate long-distance signaling. Previous studies suggest that the dispersal of elicitors such as Glu may rely on bulk flow and diffusion14. Given that GSH has a molecular weight similar to that of amino acids, a plausible scenario is that when plants experience mechanical damage or insect attack, a large volume of GSH from the intracellular region may surge into the apoplastic region, inducing calcium influx by activation of the GLR3.3 ion channel. With the action of diffusion and bulk flow of GSH within the vascular bundles, calcium signals can be rapidly transmitted between leaves. In addition to the diffusion and bulk flow theory, other theories have also been proposed, such as the osmoelectric siphon model, which is based on membrane depolarization leading to cell water shedding into the apoplast followed by membrane repolarization and water uptake43. More recently, osmotic pressure has been suggested to induce the systemic apoplastic release of signaling molecules like Glu15. Future studies aimed at uncovering the potential mechanisms underlying GSH-triggered systemic Ca2+signal transmission would be fascinating. Plant materials and growth condition hairpin RNA-52 (hr-52)was obtained from the rolling circle amplification-mediated hairpin RNA (RMHR)-basedArabidopsislibrary in our previous study19,20.pad2-1was ordered from the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre (NASC). Seeds ofGCaMP3were from Simon Gilroy (Department of Botany, University of Wisconsin). TheGCaMP3/pad2-1was generated by genetic crosses using standard procedures.GCaMP3/glr3.3andGCaMP3/glr3.6mutants were generated by CRISPR/Cas9 in WT plants overexpressingGCaMP3. To generate the transgenic plant expressing35S::PAD2-6myc/pad2-1(PAD2/pad2-1), the coding sequence ofPAD2(AT4G23100) was cloned into the binary vectorpCAMBIA1300, and then transformed intopad2-1. Arabidopsisseeds were sterilized with 20% bleach, sown on agar plates containing Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium. After incubation in the dark at 4 °C for 2 days, plates were cultivated in a growth chamber at 22 °C with a 16 h/8 h light/dark (long day, LD) photoperiod. After 7 days, seedlings were then transplanted into soil and grown under the same condition. For insect feeding and pathogen inoculation assays, plants were grown in soil for 4–5 weeks at 22 °C with a 10 h/14 h light/dark (short day, SD) photoperiod. For real-time calcium imaging assay, plates were incubated at 4 °C for 2 days in the dark and then transferred to 22 °C with a SD photoperiod for 6–7 days. Seedlings were then transferred onto new plates and grown for additional 14–16 days prior to use. Real-time [Ca2+]cytimaging in the entire plant TransgenicArabidopsisplants stably expressingGCaMP3were imaged with a motorized epifluorescence (SZX10, Olympus) stereomicroscope equipped with a 1 × objective lens and aC13440digital camera (ORCA-Flash4.0 V3, Hamamatsu Photonics). The GFP-based Ca2+indicatorGCaMP3was excited using mercury lamp (X-Cite 120 Q, Excelitas). The green fluorescent signal was acquired every 2 s with theC13440camera using Standard imaging software (Olympus). Using ImageJ software, GCaMP3 signals were analyzed overtime at regions of interest (ROI). The equation ΔF/F0= (F-F0)/F0was used to calculate the fractional fluorescence changes. F0denotes the average baseline fluorescence determined by the average of F over the frames of the recording before treatment. The entire leaf area was selected as ROI for Ca2+signal analysis. Application of amino acids, tripeptides and chemical agents GSH, Glu-Pro-Ala, L-Glu, and sorbitol were dissolved in growth medium [1/2 × MS salts, 1% (w/v) sucrose and 0.05% (w/v) MES], which was then adjusted to pH 5.1. 5 μL of the solution was applied to the cut edge of leaf 1 after 30 min recovery period after pre-cutting for assessment of small molecules-induced Ca2+signal transmission. In contrast, a longer recovery period of 5 h post pre-cutting was required for the assessment of small molecules-activated gene expression levels. GSH at concentrations of 0.001 mM, 0.01 mM, 0.1 mM, 1 mM, 5 mM, 10 mM, 25 mM, 50 mM, and 100 mM, which are within or exceeding its physiological concentrations, were selected for analyzing GSH-triggered systemic calcium-based defense signaling in vitro. GGsTOP (HY-108467, MCE) was dissolved in DMSO and diluted with water. LaCl3was dissolved into 0.05% (v/v) Silwet L-77 in water to make a 50 mM solution and then 10 μL was applied to a piece of Kiwmwipes placed on a petiole for at least 30 min prior to adding GSH. CRISPR/Cas9 vector construction and plant transformation DNA extraction and mutation detection 1–5 mg frozen leaf tissues were used for DNA extraction through SDS method. The extracted genomic DNA was then used as a template to amplify the desired fragments in each of the target genes using primers flanking the target sites. PCR products were directly sequenced using Sanger method to identify mutation. Superimposed sequence chromatograms produced by biallelic and heterozygous mutations were decoded by DSDecode (http://dsdecode.scgene.com/) and manual analyses. Total RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, and qRT-PCR TransZol RNA kit (ET101-01, TransGen Biotech) was used to extract total RNA fromArabidopsisplants according to manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA was synthesized from the total RNA in a 20 μL reaction by cDNA Synthesis SuperMix kit (AT311-03, TransGen Biotech). qRT-PCR was performed in QuantStudio 3 realtime PCR system (Applied Biosystems, USA) using ChamQ SYBR qPCR Master Mix (Low ROX Premixed) (Q331-02, Vazyme). The 2-ΔΔCtanalysis method was used to calculate the relative expression levels of each sample. JA and JA-Ile quantification in leaf tissues Measurement of endogenous Glu and GSH inArabidopsis Leaf tissues were collected and directly ground into powder in liquid nitrogen. Then, 100 mg of powder was weighed accurately and transferred into a 2 mL centrifuge tube. 10 µL of stable isotope internal standard (5 µg/mL13C2-15N-GSH, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) was added to each sample before extraction. Then, 1.5 mL of extraction buffer (80% methanol with 0.1% formic acid, v/v) was added, with vortexing for sample resuspension. After a 15 min centrifugation at 14000 ×g, the supernatants were diluted 10 times, and 100 µL was transferred to sample vials for further detection. Target compounds were detected with a 6500 plus QTrap mass spectrometer (AB SCIEX, USA) coupled with a ACQUITY UPLC H-Class system, equipped with a heated electrospray ionization (HESI) probe. Extracts were separated by a synergi Hydro-RP column (2.0 × 100 mm, 2.5 μm, phenomenex). A binary solvent system was used, in which mobile phase A consisted of 2 mM Triisobutylamine adjusted with 5 mM acetic acid in 100% water, and mobile phase B of 100% methanol. An 8 min gradient with flow rate of 500 μL/min was used as follows: 0–1.0 min at 2% B; 1.0-6 min, 5–40% B; 6–7 min, 98% B; 7.1-8 min, 2% B. Column chamber and sample tray were held at 35 °C and 10 °C, respectively. Data were acquired in multiple reaction monitor (MRM) mode with mass transitions (precursor ions/product) as followed: 308.1 > 179.1 for GSH, 147.9 > 83.9 for Glu and 311.0 > 181.9 for13C2-15N-GSH. The nebulizer gas (Gas1), heater gas (Gas2), and curtain gas were set at 55, 55, and 35 psi, respectively. The ion spray voltage was 4500 V in positive mode. The optimal probe temperature was determined to be 500 °C. Calibration curves of Glu and GSH were made with standards, and the concentration of GSH was calculated by internal-standard method with13C2-15N-GSH as internal standard, while the concentration of Glu was calculated by external-standard method. The SCIEX OS software (version 1.6, AB SCIEX, MA, USA) was applied for metabolite identification and concentration calculation. Insect feeding assay withSpodoptera exigua S. exigualarvae (2ndinstar) were purchased from Jiyuan Baiyun Industry Co., Ltd (China). For feeding assays, 2ndinstarS. exigualarvae were first underwent 24 h of starvation treatment in growth chamber and were then gently placed on 5 week-old plants. TwoS. exigualarvae were placed on a plant. Larval weights were measured 7 days after feeding. RepresentativeS. exigualarvae recovered from corresponding plants were killed by 75% ethanol solution and photographed by stereomicroscope (SZX10, Olympus) equipped with a 0.75 × objective lens and a digital camera (SC180, Olympus). Botrytis cinereainfection assay Conidiospores were collected fromB. cinerea(B0510) plates and diluted to ~1 × 106conidiospores/mL in PDB medium (Potato Dextrose Broth, BD). For drop-inoculation assay, 5 μLB. cinereaspores was dropped on the center of each detached leaf. Subsequently the detached leaves were placed in dark with high humidity for 2–3 days. Phenotypes were imaged with a digital camera and the lesion sizes were measured using Digimizer software (v3.1.2.0, Belgium, Germany). For spray-inoculation assay, 4 week-old soil-grown seedlings were sprayed evenly withB. cinereaconidiospores and kept in high humidity for 2–3 days. The disease severity was classified into four grades: healthy (H, green), light symptoms (L, pale green), severe symptoms (S, orange-yellow), or completely dead (D, red). PDB buffer served as mock in these infection assays. As described in previous studies45–47, the assessment ofB. cinereabiomass was determined by real-time PCR quantification of the fungalCUTINASEsignal (Z69264) in relation toArabidopsis ACTIN2. RNA sequencing and data analysis RNA integrity was checked using the RNA Nano 6000 Assay Kit of the Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA). Sequencing libraries were generated using NEBNext® UltraTM RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina® (NEB, USA) following manufacturer’s recommendations and index codes were added to attribute sequences to each sample. The clustering of the index-coded samples was performed on a cBot Cluster Generation System using TruSeq PE Cluster Kit v3-cBot-HS (Illumia) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After cluster generation, the library preparations were sequenced on an Illumina Novaseq platform and 150 bp paired-end reads were generated. Low-quality reads were removed from the raw reads using Cutadapt48and Trimmomatic49software to get clean reads. Clean reads were mapped to the corresponding reference genome using HISAT2 software50. Gene expression levels and read count of each gene were calculated using StringTie software51. The R package DEseq2 (v1.16.1) was used to identify the differentially expressed genes based on the following criteria:padj< 0.05 and |log2FoldChange| > 152. Venn diagramming, GO enrichment analysis was performed using TBtools (v2.007)53. Structure prediction and molecular docking All data were statistically analyzed using GraphPad Prism 8.0, SPSS, and R software and presented by Adobe Illustrator. Means and deviations were reported in the Figures and the corresponding figure legends.
