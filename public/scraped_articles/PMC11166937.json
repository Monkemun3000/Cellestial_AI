Subject terms:Adaptive immunity, Innate immunity, Gene regulation in immune cells, Space physics The phenotype and function of immune cells could change during spaceflight. Here the authors use simulated microgravity, coupled to validation with spaceflight data, to assess whether there are distinct gene expression changes in resting and TLR 7/8 stimulated PBMCs and found conserved changes in IFN signalling, the cytoskeleton, IL-6 and sirtuin signalling. Astronauts in low earth orbit (LEO), such as on the international space station (ISS), experience immune dysfunction associated with the microgravity environment. Multiple studies have described immune dysregulation in short or long-term simulated1–4or actual microgravity5–9. For the most part, such studies have described impaired T-cell responses, coupled with some form of heightened innate immunity7,10, though some innate immune cells, like natural killer (NK) cells, also show impaired function11. Consistent with altered adaptive immunity, potentially due to impaired cytotoxic and Th1 T cell function, and reduced NK cell function, astronauts develop increased reactivation of latent viruses, including herpes viruses (EBV, CMV, VZV)3,7,12–15. In one study, viral shedding after 9–14 days of spaceflight was linked to changes in serum cytokines, including a preferential large increase in IL-4 compared to interferon (IFN)γ, indicating a possible shift away from Th1 immunity towards Th2 immunity16. Consistently, some astronauts report heightened hypersensitivity reactions, such as increased allergic and Th2-like responses in space7. Multiple studies using higher throughput approaches have started to add insight into pathways impacted by spaceflight. In the Twins study17, a one-year ISS mission altered innate, adaptive, and NK cell-mediated immunity across bulk RNA sequencing analysis. In T cells, increases in DNA methylation were seen in the promoters ofnotch3for CD4+T cells, linked to T cell differentiation, and inscl1a5/asct2, linked to activation, for CD8+T cells. A total of 50 of 62 assayed cytokines were also altered by spaceflight or landing17. During a recent multi-omic analysis, including bulk RNA and DNA methylation sequencing, of astronauts and mice in space, mouse organs such as the liver and kidney demonstrated reduced IFN signatures, coupled to altered methylation patterns of these gene sets, while muscles had increased IFNγ, IL-1, and TNF10. Serum inflammatory markers from 59 astronauts in this study (and in a similar companion study) showed increased VEGF-1, IGF-1, and IL-1 during spaceflight, which resolved upon returning to Earth4,10. This same study also identified mitochondrial dysfunction as a major response of different non-hematolymphoid tissues to spaceflight10. More recently, another study using a NASA-developed Rotating Wall Vessel, which was employed in our current work, utilized a 41-parameter mass cytometry approach to show that short-term (18–22 hours) simulated microgravity can dampen NK cell, CD4+, and CD8+T cell responses to Concanavalin A/anti-CD28 stimulation, but potentiates STAT5 signaling to boost Tregs18. Despite these important advances, the core fundamental mechanisms, genes, and pathways that are directly altered by microgravity to adversely impact immunity, including at single-cell resolution, are largely unknown. Interestingly, mechanical forces are emerging as critical orchestrators of immune cell function, whereby mechanotransduction tunes immune cell responsiveness to danger signals19. Some of these effects occur through environmental modulation of mechanosensing pathways that alter ion currents in cells, metabolism, or directly act on the cytoskeleton19. Thus, a spaceflight environment, which alters forces such as gravity, associated hydrostatic pressure, and shear force20,21onto immune cells likely directly contributes to immune system dysfunction. Here, using a common ground-based analog, the NASA developed low shear modeled microgravity Rotating Wall Vessel (RWV)2,18,22, we examine in depth how short-term (25 hours) exposure to simulated microgravity impacts the human peripheral blood mononuclear immune system in detail at single-cell resolution. Combining this data with validation experiments from mice and crewmembers in LEO, as well as machine learning algorithms, we identify numerous core genes and pathways in immune cells that are altered by simulated microgravity or spaceflight, and identify numerous potential compounds that directly map onto immune cell transcriptional signatures in simulated microgravity. Simulated microgravity alters the transcriptional landscape of individual immune cells To begin understanding how simulated microgravity impacts immune cell function, we loaded PBMC samples from two young healthy CMV+ donors, one male, and one female, into either RWV simulated microgravity (uG) or normal gravity (1G) static controls for 16 hours of conditioning. The 16-hour-conditioning time point was chosen based on prior work that used approximately the same time and tracked transcriptional or proteomic changes on immune cells to simulated microgravity1,18. PBMCs were either left unstimulated or stimulated for an additional 9 hours with R848, a standard TLR7/8 agonist. We chose TLR7/8 as a putative target since it mimics viral infection, and is expressed on most human immune cells, including T cells23. Using this methodology, we next developed a single-cell atlas of 55,648 human PBMCs exposed to these conditions. Fig. 1.

After stimulating PBMCs with a TLR7/8 agonist in 1G and simulated microgravity, we characterized 23 clusters of immune cells by UMAP (Fig.3A). In contrast to the unstimulated conditions, stimulation with a TLR7/8 agonist induced a robust preferential expansion of CD4+central memory (TCM) cells (Fig.3B). The microgravity itself impacted differential response to stimulation. Consistent with previous reports, simulated microgravity dampened expansion/responses of NK cells, and CD8+TEM cells to a lesser extent in the donors examined18, as well as MAIT cell numbers, a cell type with previously unknown responses to microgravity. Simulated microgravity drove a preferential increase in CD14+monocytes over 1G controls, indicating that this cell type is especially sensitive to the combination of simulated microgravity and TLR7/8 activation.

We next sought to validate overlapping genes against mice and people flown in LEO. While multiple stressors exist in LEO, the proximity to Earth and the presence of the Earth’s magnetic field negates some effects of galactic cosmic rays, especially at the altitude of the ISS. Thus, microgravity plays an important role in driving phenotypic changes in LEO. To accomplish this goal, we first mined data from NASA’s GeneLab database for its largest study looking at a major immune organ, the spleen, in mice flown on the ISS. The GLDS-420 study provides data from the spleens of ten mice housed on the ISS for 33 days compared to ten ground controls. Though this cohort represents longer exposure to microgravity than our single-cell data’s more acute exposure, any overlapping genes could represent persistent microgravity-sensitive immune cell genes across longer duration exposure. From the GLDS-420 dataset, we identified 1448 significant DEGs (Fig.5D), of which 50/375 (13.3%) overlapped in the same direction as our single-cell core list (Fig.5E). Interestingly, many of the overlapping genes were represented as part of altered core pathways from the single-cell data. For instance, we saw shared induced overlapping genes in acute immune responses or complement (such asc3), autophagy (atg7), heat-shock responses (hsp90ab1,hsp90aa1,hspa1a,hspa1), and the cytoskeleton (dynll1). Overlapping reduced genes included interferon response (stat1), and again, cold shock genes (cirbp,rbm3), amongst others. Overall, we saw a significant enrichment in our core single-cell DEGs across mouse spleens flown in space by Fisher’s Exact Test for gene overlap (Fig.5E). Pathway analysis with IPA was next performed to identify major canonical pathways altered across all four complete datasets (single-cell unstimulated, single-cell stimulated with TLR7/8 agonist, Bulk RNA-seq validation unstimulated, and GLDS-420), including overlapping pathways shared across all datasets. These pathways are displayed in a heat map for comparison (see below), and will be described at that point. Fig. 6.

Two-tailed paired parametricttest was used, *p≤ 0.05. Data are plotted as mean ± SEM and source data are provided with this paper. We next sought to investigate our core signature of reduced IFN signaling elicited in microgravity across immune cells (Fig.6F, Supplemental Fig.19A, B). Specifically, we assessed whether reduced interferon signaling was due to reduced local production of interferons. Supernatants from 25 hours unstimulated or 9 hours R848 simulated (25 hours total culture) PBMCs were assessed by ELISA for total IFNα (detecting 12 IFNα subtypes), and IFNγ. Simulated microgravity significantly reduced both IFNα and IFNγ secretion with TLR7/8 stimulation. At baseline, the levels of these cytokines were low, and variable, and thus not significantly different between 1G and simulated microgravity. These findings point to reduced production of IFNs in simulated microgravity, at least under TLR stimulation, as measured by ELISA, potentially as one contributing mechanism to reduced interferon signaling observed at the transcriptional level.

Two-tailed paired parametricttest was used, *p≤ 0.05. Data are plotted as mean ± SEM and source data are provided with the paper. Despite the marked transcriptional reversal in simulated microgravity observed with one compound, quercetin failed to reverse reductions in interferon signaling, a major hallmark of microgravity on immune system dysfunction from our data. Other studies have also linked microgravity and spaceflight to mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS production10,34,35. In this regard, quercetin also showed a robust capacity to reduce ROS levels after 25 hours of simulated microgravity (Fig.7G), though ROS was only marginally increased as a trend by simulated microgravity itself after 25 hours, likely due to the expression of endogenous antioxidant systems at this timepoint34. Consistently, we also observed increased oxidative stress responses, such as NRF2-mediated or sirtuin signaling in many of our transcriptomic datasets by IPA analysis (Fig.7E). Immune dysfunction during spaceflight is an important health risk, and manifests primarily as increased vulnerability to opportunistic infections, including latent viral reactivation3. Latent viruses can reactivate on both short- and long-term spaceflights, and commonly involve herpes viruses (HSV1, EBV, CMV, VZV)12–15. Astronauts also experience heightened skin sensitivity reactions3,13,36, and this mechanism was thought to be related to a possible Type 2 immune bias in space7,16,36. Recent work in simulated microgravity has also shown reduced JAK/STAT signaling in CD8+T cells, coupled to increased pSTAT5 signaling in Tregs. Despite these important advances, major mechanisms explaining these phenotypes of immune dysfunction, in simulated microgravity have remained unclear. We have identified numerous core pathways and genes altered across human immune cells in simulated microgravity, with validation against datasets of humans in LEO, as well as spleens from mice flow on the ISS. Overall, we noted changes consistent with basal innate immune cell inflammatory changes in simulated microgravity, coupled with distinct pathways of dysfunction in multiple immune cells. Specifically, the most consistently reproduced pathways impacted by simulated microgravity across immune cells in both single-cell and validation cohorts included changes to pathways and signaling linked to acute phase response signaling, Coronavirus pathogenesis, IL-6 signaling, the cytoskeleton, interferon response, pyroptosis, heat-shock, nuclear receptors, and sirtuin biology. The link between the cytoskeleton and other pathways here may be especially relevant in immune dysfunction. Cytoskeleton dynamics are controlled by a number of factors, but small GTPases, including Ras homology (Rho) GTPases, are major orchestrators with critical impact on immune cell function, migration, gene expression, trafficking, phagocytosis, proliferation, and antigen recognition31. Of note, Rho GTPases have been implicated in response to simulated microgravity in other cell types, but this connection is understudied in immune cells37. Across most datasets, we saw changes to Rho GTPase signaling, including individually in RAC, RHOA, or CDC42 signaling, or combined in a global “regulation of actin-based motility by Rho” pathway in IPA. While we did notice some variability between our initial unstimulated vs stimulated single-cell data in these pathways, these pathways tended to show reduced RHOA signaling without stimulation, coupled with increased RAC signaling, analogous to what we observed from the I4 crew members upon landing. The JAXA6 dataset also demonstratedcdc42to be the most significantly induced cell-free transcript in astronauts after 30 days in space. Pathways strongly linked to cytoskeletal remodeling, such as leukocyte extravasation, were also typically induced in most of our datasets. We also observed changes in some active Rho GTPases by G-LISA, as well as in F-actin granularity, variance, 3D surface area, sphericity, actin protrusion length, and dynamic change to TLR stimulation by super-resolution microscopy, providing further evidence for changes in actin, including possibly immune cytoskeleton alteration or dysfunction, in simulated microgravity. Importantly, changes to the actin cytoskeleton are now being linked to the ability of an immune cell to mount an interferon response. Indeed, danger-sensing molecules like TLRs utilize Rho GTPases to facilitate IFN responses38,39, or antiviral sensors can directly modulate actin rearrangement40. One example is the PKR antiviral response, which was consistently downregulated by simulated microgravity in our datasets. In this system, PKR binds gelsolin to enforce basal innate immune defense, though upon viral sensing, PKR dissociates from gelsolin, leading to the severing of actin, and activation of RIG-I-like receptor (RLR)s signaling and interferon response41. Other antiviral sensors like RIG-I directly bind F-actin in resting cells, and then relocalize to the mitochondria via actin rearrangements on viral infection, to induce type 1 IFN42,43. In single-cell data, reduced interferon signaling without stimulation was seen mainly in monocytes, linking it to innate immunity, though with TLR7/8 stimulation, reduced interferon signaling was seen across many cells, including most T cell subsets, and NK cells, displaying the broad importance of this pathway across most immune cells to microgravity. In simulated microgravity, we saw reduced IFNα production by ELISA with stimulation, so we cannot rule out the possibility that the reduced IFN signaling seen in simulated microgravity starts with reduced capacity for IFN production in some conditions, in addition to potential defects in downstream signaling itself. While we have focused on type 1 IFN signaling, some reduced interferon responses are also linked to reduced signaling from the IFN gamma receptor (IFNGR). Consistently, we also noted reduced IFNγ production in simulated microgravity upon TLR7/8 stimulation. Whether the cytoskeleton is needed for IFNGR clustering and signaling remains to be seen44. Consistent with reduced interferon signaling in simulated microgravity, we noticed a reduction in some IFN-inducible GTPase superfamily genes, namely guanylate binding proteins (GBPs) across our datasets. Various GBPs (e.g.,gbp5) were reduced as well in the Twins study. Interestingly, GBPs, which are heavily induced by IFNγ signaling, have been shown to be critical in maintaining responses tomycobacterium tuberculosis45,46, and we see reactivation of similar bacteria (in addition to some retroviruses) in simulated microgravity after as little as 25 hours of exposure. GBPs and associated IFN responses also help direct inflammasome activation and pyroptosis (an inflammatory form of cell death) linked to antimicrobial defense that was consistently down in monocytes and B cells in simulated microgravity, and in nearly all immune cells in response to TLR7/8 stimulation in simulated microgravity46,47. Interestingly, pyroptosis and inflammasome activation can also be directly controlled by Rho GTPases and the cytoskeleton48,49. Another pathway found consistently down across datasets included LXR signaling. Interestingly, LXR signaling also can promote antimicrobial defense mechanisms. Macrophage LXR has been shown to reduce bacterial infection by reducing intracellular NAD+in a CD38 manner, with mechanistic impacts on the cytoskeleton50. Whether NAD+levels fall in microgravity remains to be seen, though we did see an interesting increase in sirtuin signaling across datasets, including in the I4 mission. Sirtuins may be functioning to counter acute oxidative stress in microgravity34,51. We also saw reduced oxidative phosphorylation transcriptional signatures across all unstimulated immune cells in simulated microgravity. Altered metabolite levels (and possibly ROS) from impaired oxidative phosphorylation might also contribute to HIF1α stabilization52as observed in some of our simulated microgravity and spaceflight datasets. Reduced oxidative phosphorylation can be associated with increased glycolysis in immune cells53, fueling “M1-like” pro-inflammatory changes in macrophages, potentiating NF-κb signaling, acute responses and IL-6 or IL-1 release, cytokines frequently induced in microgravity. Consistently, we did notice a preferential enrichment of predicted “macrophage classical activation” signatures across our gene sets in the Twins study. Interestingly, we noted frequent increases in heat-shock genes, coupled to increased associated BAG signaling pathways across antigen-presenting cells (monocytes, B cells, and DCs), as well as in double negative T cells. Heat-shock expression may be reflective of altered proteostasis in simulated microgravity10, and may be required for adaptation to mechanical unloading in some cells34, though this may also be linked to higher temperatures. Across all gene sets, we noticed a reduction in the cold shock gene,rbm3, which was reduced in nearly all immune cells in our single-cell data. Increased heat-shock coupled with reduced cold shock genes raises the possibility of higher intracellular temperatures directly induced by microgravity, but whether microgravity, or associated increase in cytokines or binding partners such as IL-1ra, directly induce the observed “space fever” in astronauts requires further insight54. Interestingly, we did notice a number of significant IL-1 ligands in innate cell to T cell interactions in our microgravity Interactome, highlighting the possible importance of this cytokine family and downstream interacting molecules. Pertaining the aforementioned skin lesions in astronauts, it has been postulated that persistent skin hypersensitivity reactions in some crew members may be linked to allergic responses7,16. While analysis of our datasets cannot rule out this possibility, we did not observe increased Th2 signatures across our simulated microgravity systems, or with our specific gene sets validated across the I4 mission. We also saw inconsistent changes to IL-23 and IL-17 signaling across our datasets, though these cytokines are known contributors to skin disease55. While the root causes of such lesions cannot be inferred from our data analysis, it likely involves changes in the crosstalk with the skin microbiome, in addition to intrinsic immune cell abnormalities. Interestingly, we did see reduced aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) signaling in most of our datasets, especially in CD14 monocytes and conventional type 2 dendritic cells, raising the idea of reduced AHR signaling in space to contribute to skin lesions56,57. However, we saw AHR signaling was enriched in the Twins study gene set result and so more experimentation is needed to tease out a possible role for the AHR in astronaut skin lesions. Our data support a hypothetical model where microgravity alters forces sensed by immune cells, leading to changes in the actin cytoskeleton, and nuclear receptor signaling, coupled to changes in core pathways in space such as mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. Recent work in other cells, such as endothelial cells, has identified cytoskeletal abnormalities as a key feature of simulated microgravity that drives autophagy and a reduction in mitochondrial mass after 72 hours of exposure35. Our datasets would support some of these findings. Combined, these pathways would contribute to reduced oxidative phosphorylation and associated basal inflammatory processes, as well as reduced viral sensing pathways, associated reduced interferon responses and altered pyroptosis capability. Reduced interferon responses and signaling, impact both innate cells like monocytes and NK cells, as well as adaptive cells like T cells. Such changes could cumulate in viral or mycobacterial reactivation in microgravity. These processes would also be complemented by the psychological and physiological stresses of spaceflight, which also may independently associate with viral reactivation12,14,58. Thus, an important future direction of research is to address whether altered cytoskeleton, or associated reductions in interferon related gene products, including GBPs, are actively driving the reactivation of mycobacteria and latent viruses that we see in simulated microgravity. Another related important avenue of future research is to better understand how changes to force action on immune cells link to the mitochondria dysfunction hallmark of spaceflight and metabolic alterations, and to map such changes to immune cell metabolism as has been done to other mechanical forces19,59. Moreover, the immune system in spaceflight is also under the influence of changing pressure gradients, such as increased pressures in parts of the upper body60, coupled to lower central venous pressure and potentially altered shear force61–63. These changes may also contribute to altered immune function, including the increased IL-1 and IL-6, two cytokines sensitive to external force cues, seen in spaceflight, with potential for intersecting signaling nodes across mechanotransduction and other pathways such as mitochondrial dysfunction within immune cells19. More work is needed to understand how these additional changes in force impact innate and adaptive immunity during spaceflight and how they interact with the effects of microgravity. Studies were conducted under the supervision and in accordance with ethical guidelines of the Buck Institute for Research on Aging. In particular, protocols for the purchasing of human blood products from Stanford University are described in the next section below. Human blood sample and cell culture De-identified peripheral blood buffy coat samples were obtained from the Stanford University Blood Center under official signed contract agreements with the Buck Institute for Research on Aging, following the Stanford Blood Center’s Certification of Human Subjects Approval for minimal risk research-related activities (IRB eProtocol# 13942). A total of 27 healthy human buffy coats between the ages of 20 and 46 were purchased from the Stanford University Blood Center. PBMCs were isolated using a Ficoll gradient method. PBMCs were counted and resuspended in complete media at 1 × 106cells/ml (RPMI 1640, 10% Fetal Bovine Serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 0.1 mM non-essential Amino acid,1 mM sodium pyruvate, 50 μM 2-mercaptoethanol,10 mM HEPES). To generate simulated microgravity, the cell suspension was loaded into 10 ml disposable high aspect ratio vessels (Synthecon, Houston, TX) and rotated at 15 rpm for 25 hours. For the 1G control, the cell suspension was plated in standard 6-well culture plates, as standard static culture plates or culture flasks have been shown to be comparable to static high aspect ratio vessels by others in major immunological assays2. 1G and simulated microgravity cultures were simultaneously placed in the same 37 C, 5% CO2 incubator. To stimulate PBMCs, samples were mixed with 1 μM R848 (TLR7/8 agonist, Invivogen, San Diego, CA) after 16 hours, for 9 hours of stimulation. At the end of each experiment, the cell suspension was quickly collected, spun down at 500 ×g, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and used for downstream analysis. For super-resolution imaging cells were fixed before centrifuging. 1 × 104PBMCs from each condition were counted and loaded on the 10X Genomics Chromium Controller and the libraries were prepared using Chromium Next GEM Single-Cell 5’ Reagent Kit v2 according to the manufacturer’s protocol (10X Genomics, Pleasanton, CA). The quality of libraries was assessed using Agilent TapeStation 4200 (Santa Clara, CA), and test-sequenced on Illumina NextSeq 550 (San Diego, CA). The full sequencing was performed on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 by SeqMatic (Fremont, CA). Processing of single-cell RNA-seq data Data processing was performed using 10x Genomics Cell Ranger v6.1.2 and MTD26pipelines. The “cellranger count” was used to perform transcriptome alignment, filtering, and UMI counting from the FASTQ (raw data) files. Alignment was done against the human genome GRCh38-2020-A. Cell numbers after processing were: 1G unstimulated 13,304 cells, uG unstimulated 21,709 cells, 1G stimulated 16,397 cells, and uG stimulated 14,913 cells. The MTD pipeline was used to generate the single-cell microbiome count matrix from the FASTQ files. Downstream analyses were performed in R (version 4.2.0), primarily using the Seurat R package (version 4.1.1)65,66and custom analysis scripts. First, we executed a quality control step that removed the cells containing >10% mitochondrial RNA and ≤250 genes/features. The doublet cells were identified and removed from the downstream analysis by using the DoubletFinder R package (version 2.0.3)67with parameters PCs = 1:30, pN = 0.25, and nExp = 7.5%. To avoid the influence of hemoglobin transcripts on the analysis, we filtered out the putative red blood cells (defined by the method below) before the following process. A total of 55,648 cells remained for subsequent analysis. Raw RNA counts were first normalized and stabilized with the SCTransform v2 function (SCT), then followed by the CCA integration workflow for joint analysis of single-cell datasets. In doing so, the top 3000 highly variable genes/features among the datasets were used to run SCT; and then 3000 highly variable genes/features and the 30 top principal components (PCs) with k.anchor = 5 were used to find “anchors” for integration. The clustering step was executed by using the 30 top PCs summarizing the RNA expression of each cell with a resolution parameter of 0.8. Following differential expression, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, Qiagen) was used to discover changes in enriched pathways in each comparison. DEGs withpvalues < 0.05 and |Log2FC|> 0.1 were incorporated into the IPA canonical pathway analysis. To study the inferred trajectory of PBMC differentiation, cell trajectory analysis was performed by using the Monocle 3 R package (version 1.2.9)71,72. We first subsetted Seurat data to uG and 1G groups then run the functions as.cell_data_set(), cluster_cells(), and learn_graph(). Then, we ran order_cells() with the selection of cell types representing early development stages (CD4 naive, B naive, plasmablast, and HSPC) as the roots of the trajectory. Calculating cell scores of inflammatory aging and cellular senescence The inflammatory aging (iAge)24index was calculated by the sum of the cell scores that count by multiplying normalized and transformed gene expression with the corresponding coefficient of the gene in the iAge gene set. Cellular senescence was scored using Seurat AddModuleScore function65,73on the SenMayo gene set25. Viral and microbial abundance analysis APCs to T cell intercellular communication To study the difference in intercellular communication from APCs to T cells between uG and 1G, we used nichenetr R packages (version 1.1.0)27to analyze cells in the dataset belonging to APCs (B cells, DCs, or monocytes) and T cell types. The “Differential NicheNet” workflow was implemented. The expressed genes in sender cells—APCs were selected if they were expressed in at least 10% of that APC cell population. The gene set of interest in receiver cells—T cells was defined by adjustedpvalue ≤ 0.05 and Log2FC ≥ 0.25 in the DEGs. Top 30 ligands that were further used to predict activated target genes and construct an activated ligand-receptor network. Default settings were used for all other parameters. Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Cat# 74134, Qiagen) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA quantity check, preparation of RNA library, and mRNA sequencing were conducted by Novogene Co., LTD (CA, US). About 20 million paired-end 150 bp reads per sample were generated from Illumina NovaSeq 6000 Sequencing System. FASTQ raw reads were analyzed using the MTD pipeline26. Differential gene expression analysis between groups was done by DESeq2 R package (version 1.36.0)75with control for the subject effect. Genes with adjustedpvalue < 0.05 were considered as differentially expressed. DEGs withpvalues < 0.05 and |Log2FC|>0.5 were used for the IPA canonical pathway analysis. Different from single-cell (SC), to calculate the iAge index for bulk RNA-seq, normalized and transformed gene expression was multiplied with the gene’s coefficient in the iAge gene set, then summed for each sample. Cellular senescence was scored using the ssGSEA76method on the SenMayo gene set. Cell Type Frequency Changes within PBMCs were predicted by CIBERSORTx Docker image–Fractions Mode version 1.0. Our single-cell RNA-seq data from PBMCs was used to build the Signature Matrix File as the reference to predict the cell proportion in the bulk RNA-seq data. Mouse spleen bulk RNA-seq analysis Mouse spleen Bulk RNA-seq raw data was acquired from NASA GeneLab Data Repository with the accession ID:GLDS-420. Ten mice in space flight and ten mice in ground control (GC) were used in the experiment. The detailed study description and experiment protocols are on the data repositoryhttps://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-420. MTD pipeline was used to process the FASTQ raw data, generate the count matrix, and then analyze differentially expressed genes between Flight and Ground groups. FDA-approved drugs (n= 1692) are selected from the DrugBank database and food compounds (n= 7962) are selected from the FoodDB database as previously described32. LINCS compounds (n= 5414) are obtained from the LINCS L1000 project. ‘Compound’ is used as a general term for ‘drug’, ‘food compound’ and ‘LINCS compound’ throughout the document. Compound-protein interactions are extracted from the STITCH database v5.079by matching the InChI keys of drugs/food/LINCS compounds. STITCH collects information from multiple sources and individual scores from each source are combined into an overall confidence score. After processing, three datasets are obtained: (i) drug-gene interaction dataset containing 1890 drugs and 16,654 genes with 542,577 interactions (ii) food compound-gene interaction dataset containing 7654 compounds and 116,375 genes and 818,737 interactions (iii) LINCS compound-gene interaction dataset containing 5414 compounds and 16,794 genes and 692,152 interactions. Statistical significance for the overlap between compound genes and the DEGs from the uG vs 1G of the unstimulated PBMCs single-cell RNA-seq is calculated using Fisher’s Exact Test. The universal gene set contains all genes that interact with at least one compound. The compound with a lowpvalue interacts with a higher proportion of the DEGs than that expected by chance. Statistically significant compounds were then obtained after the Bonferroni adjustment ofpvalues. The pipeline for this compound analysis is implemented in the R script GCEA. Cell staining and imaging (super-resolution microscopy) Live PBMCs were stained with 60 nM MitoTracker Red-CMX-Ros (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA) either in 6-well plates or in the microgravity chambers for the last 2 hr of the microgravity simulation. At the end of the microgravity simulation cells were immediately fixed by 1:1 mixing the cell suspensions with 2× concentrated fixative (10% Sucrose (w/v) 120 mM KCl, 1% (w/v) glutaraldehyde, 8% (w/v) PFA pH 7.4) and incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature followed by 15 minutes on ice. Fixed cells were washed and stored in PBS until further staining for up to a week at 4 °C. 1 million fixed cells were resuspended in 1 mL of permeabilization solution (0.1% TritonX-100 in PBS) for 5 minutes. After twice washing in PBS, pellets were resuspended in 0.5 mL 1% BSA PBS containing Phalloidin-iFluor-488 (cat# ab176753, Abcam plc., Cambridge, UK) at the manufacturer’s recommended dilution, and were incubated for 90 minutes with gentle agitation. After washing in PBS, cells were stained with Hoechst 33342 (1 µg/mL in PBS) for 10 minutes. The fixed-stained cells were immobilized at 3 × 105cells per well density in glass-bottom 96-well microplates (Greiner Bio-One, Monroe, NC), which were pre-coated with polyethyleneimine (1:15,000 (w/v)) for 16 hours in a 37 °C incubator, and washed twice with PBS. Microplates with the cell suspensions were centrifuged in a swing plate rotor centrifuge (Eppendorf 5810 R) at 400 ×gand for 10 min and then fixed on the surface by adding an equal volume of 8% (w/v) PFA for 5 min. Finally, the fixative was replaced with 100 µL of antifade reagent (Vector Prolong Gold (ThermoFisher)). Samples were imaged immediately after this procedure. Immobilized fixed-stained PBMCs were imaged on a Zeiss LSM980 Airyscan2 laser scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, White Plains, NY). Single PBMCs were manually selected for recording based on low-resolution preview scans showing only nuclei. All singlet cells were selected in a small neighborhood to avoid biases. In each microscopy session, 24-40 cells were selected for recording in one well for each condition. This was performed in an interleaved manner, capturing 6-8 cells at a time, and then moving to the next well and then repeating this multiple times using the Experiment Designer module for automation. Super-resolution volumes of (358 × 358 × 70 pixels, 0.035 × 0.035 × 0.13 µm/voxel resolution) were recorded in the above-determined positions using Definite Focus autofocusing. A Plan-Apochromat 63 × 1.40 Oil lens, Airyscan2 SR (super-resolution) mode with optimal sampling and frame switching between 3 fluorescence channels to minimize spectral cross-bleed were used. MitoTracker Red, iFluor488, and Hoechs33342 were excited with 561, 488, and 405 nm solid-state lasers, respectively, using the optimal emission filter for each channel. 3D Airyscan2 processing was performed with standard filtering settings. With PBMCs from four donors, in six staining and microscopy sessions total of 930 valid volumes have been recorded, and are available at 10.5281/zenodo.8415196. Mitochondria:cell volume fraction was measured using a modification of the “Mitochondria:cell volume fractionator (basic)” pipeline in Image Analyst MKII85, using the hole-filled actin image as cell marker and MitoTracker Red as mitochondrial marker, and all image planes to measure areas of mitochondrial and cell profiles. Cell and nucleus volumes and surface areas were measured using Imaris 9.9 (Oxford Instruments, Concord, MA) using the Cell and Batch modules. Cdc42, Rac1, and RhoA G-LISA activation assay PBMCs from different conditions were collected and 7 × 106cells were lysed and snap-frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. Cell lysate protein concentrations were measured using Precision Red Advanced Protein Assay Reagent (cat# ADV02, Cytoskeleton Inc., Denver, CO) and equalized. The GTP-bound Cdc42, Rac1, and RhoA levels were performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol (cat# BK127-S, BK128-S, and BK124-S respectively, Cytoskeleton Inc.) and measured with a spectrophotometer at 490 nm. The abundance of ROS was measured via 2’,7’-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA). Collected cells (100,000 cells per well) from each condition were incubated with 10 μM DCFDA Staining Buffer in dark at 37 °C for 30 minutes as per the manufacturer’s suggestions (cat# 601520; Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI). The fluorescence was measured with a Pherastar FSx (BMG Labtech Inc., Cary, NC) microplate reader with the excitation wavelength at 495 nm, and emission at 530 nm. Cell culture media (supernatant) from all experimental conditions were separately collected and snap-frozen. Samples were sent to the Stanford Human Immune Monitoring Center and MILLIPLEX 48 Plex Premixed Magnetic Bead Panel (MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA) was performed per the manufacturers’ instructions. Cell culture media (supernatant) from microgravity and 1G ± R848 were separately collected at each experiment and snap-frozen. The samples were then thawed and used to detect the levels of IFNγ (cat# 430104; Biolegend Inc., San Diego, CA), IFNα all subtypes (cat# 41135; Pestka Biomedical Laboratories, Inc., Piscataway, NJ) per the manufacturers’ instructions. Cell culture media (supernatant) from microgravity and 1G were separately collected at each experiment and snap-frozen. The samples were then thawed and used to detect the levels of IL-8 (cat# 431504; Biolegend Inc., San Diego, CA), IL-6 (cat# 430504; Biolegend Inc., San Diego, CA), IL-1β (cat# 437004; Biolegend Inc., San Diego, CA) per the manufacturers’ instructions. Quercetin (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) stock solution was prepared with DMSO at 1000×. In the cell culture experiments utilizing quercetin, the concentration of quercetin was decided based on existing literature86–89. After incubation with quercetin, cells were counted with a Cellometer Auto 2000 Cell Viability Counter (Nexcelom, San Diego, CA), which utilizes Acridine Orange and Propidium iodide dual-staining systems to accurately distinguish live vs dead cells. After 25 hours of 50 μM quercetin treatment, the cell viability across PBMCs in both 1G and simulated microgravity conditions were at least 93%. There were no statistical differences in viability observed between the groups with and without quercetin treatment.
