Draft genome sequences ofEnterobacterialesstrains isolated from the International Space Station. Microbiol Resour Announc 9:e00817-20.https://doi.org/10.1128/MRA.00817-20. Received 2020 Jul 15; Accepted 2020 Aug 13; Collection date 2020 Sep. The whole-genome sequences of 26 strains isolated from the International Space Station were generated, and the strains were identified as being members of the orderEnterobacteriales.Characterization of these whole-genome sequences might enable the identification of potential pathogenic bacteria that have been adapting to the space environment. The whole-genome sequences of 26 strains isolated from the International Space Station were generated, and the strains were identified as being members of the orderEnterobacteriales.Characterization of these whole-genome sequences might enable the identification of potential pathogenic bacteria that have been adapting to the space environment. Members of the orderEnterobacterialeshave been found to exhibit human pathogenicity and therefore pose a health risk for people on Earth and for astronauts aboard the International Space Station (ISS) (1,2). The latter is of concern for long-duration missions, as astronauts have been shown to be immunocompromised (3). Importantly, these bacteria are able to adapt to extreme conditions such as microgravity and radiation and thus persist, necessitating the development of appropriate countermeasures to control them. Members of the orderEnterobacterialesthat were found on ISS surfaces werePantoea brenneri,Pantoea agglomerans,Kalamiella piersonii, andEnterobacter bugandensis(4–6). On Earth,P. agglomeransandP. brenneriwere reported to have been isolated from human infections (4).K. piersoniiis a member of a novel genus in the familyErwiniaceaethat has exhibited resistance to multiple clinical drugs, such as penicillin and vancomycin, allowing it to be an emerging pathogen (5).E. bugandensiswas documented from blood as a causative agent of septicemia in various geological locations (7). Analyses of draft genome assemblies for these species might pave the way to identify the genetic processes responsible for potential pathogenicity, as previously reported for some of these strains (5,6). The strains used for whole-genome sequencing (WGS) were isolated from four different locations in the ISS across three flights and are detailed inTable 1(8). The ISS surface samples collected and brought back to Earth were aseptically handled, suitable aliquots of the sample concentrate (100 μl) were plated onto Reasoner’s 2A (R2A) medium and incubated at 25°C for 7 days, and a single well-isolated colony was archived at −80°C until DNA extraction. DNA was extracted from cultures grown in R2A medium using the ZymoBIOMICS DNA MagBead kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Metadata and genome statistics forEnterobacter,Kalamiella, andPantoeastrains isolated from various ISS environmental surfaces during the Microbial Tracking 1 flight project The 16S rRNA gene sequences were retrieved from the whole-genome sequence of the queried genome and analyzed with BLAST against type strains for all 16S rRNA sequences in the NCBI database. The bacterial species identity was determined when the queried sequence showed >97.5% similarity to the 16S rRNA gene sequence of the type strain (E. bugandensisDSM 29888T,K. piersoniiDSM 108198T,P. agglomeransDSM 3493T, orP. brenneriDSM 24232T). The whole-genome sequence of the nearest neighbor was further selected for ANI evaluation. The ANI value for all strain comparisons was 99%. Hyphenated designations indicate the flight number followed by the location; for example, F1-2 indicates flight 1 and location 2.

WHC, waste and hygiene compartment; PMM, permanent multipurpose module; FC, field control (a sampling wipe was exposed to the air for 120 s at the center of node 2); N1-O4, node 1 overhead 4. Contigs that were less than 200 nucleotides long were not analyzed. WGS of 26 bacterial isolates from the ISS was performed using the Illumina Nextera Flex protocol for library preparation, as used in similar studies (6). The NovaSeq 6000 system with an S4 flow cell (paired-end 2 × 150-bp reads) was used to execute paired-end sequencing. FastQC (v0.11.7) was used to validate the quality of the raw sequencing data (9). Adapter trimming and quality filtering were carried out using the software fastp (v0.20.0) to perform quality control (10). The cleaned sequences were assembled using SPAdes (v3.11.1) (11). TheN50values, numbers of contigs, and total genome lengths were generated using QUAST (v5.0.2) and used to assess the quality of the final assembly (12). The average nucleotide identity (ANI) values were calculated by comparing all strains to their respective type strains, and their taxonomic affiliations and genome statistics are given inTable 1(13). The NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline (PGAP) (v.4.11 and v.4.12) was used for genome annotation. Default parameters were used for all software.
