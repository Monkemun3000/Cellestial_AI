Author contributions: T.C.B. and B.G. designed research and wrote the paper. Our report (1) describing the discovery of extensive horizontal gene transfer in a tardigrade genome has raised questions from other groups who were sequencing theHypsibius dujardinigenome in parallel or who have done new experiments and analyses since our report (2–5). Bemm et al. (2) now report filtering our data for likely contaminants, resulting in a new, prefiltered genome assembly. Arakawa (3) has sequenced genomes of starved, washed, individual animals that had been treated with antibiotics for 48 h, and used this genomic sequence and RNA-Seq data to identify likely bona fide tardigrade contigs. Two other reports have contributed data and analysis: Delmont and Eren (4) used a newly published analysis and visualization platform, Anvi'o (6), to identify likely contaminants in our genome assembly, and Koutsovoulos et al. (5) applied useful taxon-annotated GC coverage plots (Blobplots) (7) to our data and reported an independent genome assembly. Using the HGT index, we find that 3.8–7.1% of genes in these independentH. dujardiniassemblies appear foreign (Fig. 1A). Examination of genes with prokaryotic but not eukaryotic alignments resulted in the identification of 164–384 genes (Fig. 1B). Class C genes in variousH. dujardiniassemblies range from 2.5% to 4.6% (Fig. 1C). For each of these metrics, the proportion and/or number of foreign genes found inH. dujardiniis substantially elevated compared with typical animals (Fig. 1) (8–11). In favor of these foreign genes not being contaminants is the fact that, in these independent assemblies, most genes identified as foreign reside on scaffolds together with tardigrade genes. Furthermore, foreign vs. tardigrade genes from these assemblies are represented at similar proportions in the other assemblies. On the whole, these independent assemblies show robust coverage of scaffolds from genomic and RNAseq reads of four independent sequencing efforts [including cleaned, antibiotic-treated individuals (3)] (Fig. 2). If these genes of foreign origin are considered to be contaminants and their scaffolds are removed, the completeness and size of each assembly is severely affected. Foreign genes are contained in scaffolds confirmed by multiple datasets. 14 next-generation sequencing read datasets, originating from 4 independent sequencing projects, were mapped against (A) Bemm et al.’s (2) and (B) Koutsovoulos et al.’s (5) assembly and visualized using Anvi’o (6). Tracks showing coverage of Moleculo long-read (LR), Pacbio, and short-insert library reads [University of North Carolina (UNC) 300, 500, and 800] from our original study (1) are colored blue. Tracks showing coverage by genomic reads from ref.5are colored purple. Tracks showing coverage by genomic and pooled RNAseq reads generated by Dr. Kazuharu Arakawa are colored green. The track showing coverage by pooled RNAseq reads generated by Dr. Itai Yanai is colored yellow. Black tick marks in the outer rings indicate scaffolds that contain foreign sequences identified using the method indicated in parentheses. Highlighted in red are scaffolds that are covered by genomic reads originating from only one group’s sequencing effort. Highlighted in orange are scaffolds covered by two of three groups’ genomic reads. Together, these data suggest thatH. dujardiniis likely to have an elevated level of foreign genes, most likely acquired by HGT rather than being artifacts of remaining contaminants. The level of HGT that we infer remains higher than in most animals that have been tested (Fig. 1), although not as high a level as we had originally concluded (1). It has been suggested that many foreign genes in theH. dujardinigenome might not be functional or might be contaminants because RNAseq reads do not map to some of these genes (3,5). However, it is well documented in the literature that many HGT genes are expressed at low levels or, in some cases, are not expressed at all. For example, it is known that essentially the entireWolbachiagenome has been transferred into the genome ofDrosophila ananassae,yet only ∼2% (28/1,206) of these horizontally acquired genes are transcribed at detectable levels (12). Follow-up investigations confirmed extensive HGT into the nuclear genome of thisDrosophilaspecies but failed to detect biologically relevant expression of any foreign genes (13,14). Thus, although identification of an expressed foreign gene could be viewed as evidence in favor of HGT, lack of expression alone is not a criterion for disproving HGT. We speculated that HGT might be important for tardigrade biology, but we restricted our analysis to HGT rather than functional HGT (1). The RNAseq datasets (3,5) will aid in assessing potential functions of these genes. The authors declare no conflict of interest.",
