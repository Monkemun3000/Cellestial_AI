  "content": "Evaluating the effect of spaceflight on the host–pathogen interaction between human intestinal epithelial cells andSalmonellaTyphimurium Received 2020 Aug 27; Accepted 2021 Feb 3; Collection date 2021. Humans will travel to space more frequently and for longer duration as the rapidly growing spaceflight industry enables more routine access for both professional astronauts and the public. Spaceflight can adversely affect multiple aspects of human physiology, including immune and gastrointestinal function1–4. While pre-flight screening and quarantine procedures have reduced infection incidence, astronauts and cargo can still harbor opportunistic and obligate pathogens, includingSalmonellaspp., which have been recovered from both crew refuse and International Space Station (ISS) surfaces5–8. We previously discovered that spaceflight and spaceflight analog culture increased the virulence and stress resistance of the foodborne pathogen,Salmonella entericaserovar Typhimurium (Salmonella)9–12. These environments have also been shown to increase the virulence and/or alter pathogenesis-related phenotypes of other microorganisms13–16. Collectively, these findings indicate an increased risk for infection during space travel and underscore the need for a more in-depth understanding of the similarities and differences between spaceflight and ground-based infection mechanisms. Studies performed in spaceflight and spaceflight analog environments have revealed unexpected physiological responses in both mammalian and microbial cells14,15. This is not surprising given that physical forces in the cellular microenvironment (including those associated with microgravity) profoundly alter both host and pathogen phenotypes through mechanotransduction17. An integrated network involving the cytoskeleton, cell surface receptors, and the extracellular matrix (ECM) mediates the dynamic three-dimensional (3D) interactions between host cells and their external environment to regulate cellular responses17–19. Since spaceflight alters the organization and/or expression of these classes of proteins14,20,21, it is logical to predict that this environment could impact infection processes for invasive pathogens likeSalmonellathat hijack the host and actively exploit these structural networks to enable their invasion and dissemination22,23. From the pathogen perspective, we previously discovered that spaceflight analog culture ofSalmonellain the Rotating Wall Vessel bioreactor led to increased virulence in mice24, enhanced stress resistance9–11,24, global transcriptional and proteomic reprogramming11,12,24and enhanced the colonization of a human 3D intestinal co-culture model (JB, SY, RRD, RJF, CMO, JS, CAN; manuscript in preparation). Space Shuttle experiments aboard STS-115 and STS-123 independently confirmed RWV trends by demonstrating that spaceflight increased the virulence and globally altered the transcriptomic and proteomic responses ofSalmonellarelative to identical ground controls9,10. Supplementation of select ions in the media was able to counteract this spaceflight-associated increased virulence10. It is important to note thatSalmonellavirulence studies were performed when the bacteria were cultured in spaceflight, brought back to Earth and immediately used in animal infections (i.e., the host was not exposed to spaceflight). Transcriptional profiling revealed a central role for the RNA-binding protein Hfq in the response ofSalmonellato both spaceflight and spaceflight analog culture in the RWV9,10and subsequent studies indicated altered expression ofhfqor the Hfq regulon in other microbes25–28. In this study, we investigated how spaceflight culture alters the response of human intestinal epithelial cells (HT-29) to infection bySalmonellawhen both the host and pathogen were exposed to spaceflight. The experiment was flown as part of the Space Tissue Loss (STL) payload and operationally designated as STL-IMMUNE, since epithelial cells are excellent sentinels of innate immunity by providing the first physical and chemical barriers to infection and coordinating additional innate and mucosal defenses and subsequent adaptive responses29,30. Since in-flight technical limitations precluded the use of gentamicin protection assays to quantify bacterial invasion into the epithelium, we focused our analysis on transcriptomic (dual RNA-seq of host and pathogen) and proteomic profiling (Isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification/iTRAQ). These global analyses can yield valuable insight into the status of healthy and infected cells. Figure1shows the experimental design and timeline for STL-IMMUNE and schematic of hollow fiber bioreactors used for 3D cell culture. HT-29 cells were seeded into the extracapillary space (ECS) of hollow fiber bioreactors which contained collagen I-coated capillary fibers for intestinal cell attachment. Oxygenated and CO2-containing media was continually perfused through the intracapillary space (ICS) of the fibers (underneath the basal side of the cells, which also prevented exposure of cells to high fluid shear forces). During spaceflight,Salmonellawas introduced to the apical side of HT-29 cultures through ECS ports and allowed to incubate for 6 h before fixative was perfused through the ICS. Fig. 1. STL-IMMUNE experimental design and impact of spaceflight on uninfected HT-29 transcriptional profiles. Fig. 2. Transcriptional responses of HT-29 cells elicited in response to infection withS. Typhimurium during flight or ground culture. Mammalian cell lines, bacterial strains, and flight hardware The human colonic epithelial cell line, HT-29 (ATCC, HTB-38), was cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2in GTSF-2 media (Hyclone) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (ThermoFisher Scientific), 2.25 g sodium bicarbonate (Fisher Scientific) and 5 mL insulin transferrin selenite (Sigma-Aldrich) per liter. Media used to expand cells as monolayers contained Penicillin–Streptomycin (10 units/mL and 10 µg/mL, respectively; Sigma-Aldrich) and fungizone (0.5 µg/mL). Flight culture media contained only streptomycin (Sm) and fungizone. Infection studies were performed with wild-typeS. Typhimurium χ3339, a mouse-passaged derivative of SL1344 which is naturally Sm-resistant24. Bacteria were cultured in Lennox Broth (LB) containing 0.3 M NaCl prior to loading in the hardware, as described below. HT-29 cells were cultured in 2.2 mL hollow fiber bioreactors (Spectrum Labs) that were housed in the Cell Culture Module (CCM; Tissue Genesis). The CCM hardware enabled automated media perfusion, addition of bacteria to perform infections and sample fixation. Flight comparisons were made to identical ground controls housed in the same hardware at NASA Kennedy Space Center (KSC). The flight hardware and experimental layout are shown in Fig.1. Ten days before launch,S. Typhimurium strain χ3339 was streaked from a glycerol stock onto LB agar plates containing 100 µg/mL Sm and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Bacterial colonies were then used to inoculate overnight cultures grown for 15–16 h. with aeration in LB media containing 0.3 M NaCl and 100 µg/mL Sm at 37 °C. Cultures were pelleted at 7000 r.p.m. and resuspended in Dulbecco’s Phosphate Buffered Saline (DPBS; Invitrogen). Bacteria were quantified by plating for viable CFU per mL and diluted to 1 × 107CFU/mL in DPBS to maintain the bacteria as viable but not actively growing. On L-7, flight bacteria bags were filled with 2 mL of the cultures and maintained at room temperature until attachment to the flow paths 2 days prior to launch (L-2). Preparation of hollow fiber bioreactors, media bags and fixatives Sterile bioreactors were wetted with 70% ethanol (10 mL) and then rinsed in triplicate with 10 mL DPBS. A 1 mg/mL collagen I solution (bovine, Corning) in DPBS was then introduced through the ECS ports to coat the hollow fibers. After 1 h, bioreactors were rinsed in triplicate with DPBS through the ECS ports to remove unbound collagen. Bioreactors were rinsed in triplicate with 10 mL of warm flight medium and placed at 37 °C until ready for loading with HT-29 cells. Flight and ground control bags contained either 60 mL of flight culture media or 40 mL RNAlater II fixative (Ambion) for transcriptomic and proteomic analyses. Preparation and loading of HT-29 cells into flight hardware HT-29 cells were expanded as monolayers in T-75 flasks. Four days prior to launch, confluent monolayers were washed in warm Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution without calcium and magnesium (ThermoFisher Scientific), dissociated using 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA (Corning), and counted using trypan blue exclusion to determine cell viability. Approximately 1 × 106HT-29 cells were loaded into twelve 2.2 mL hollow fiber bioreactors (Spectrum) through the ECS ports (Fig.1). Six bioreactors were designated for flight (three infected and three time-matched uninfected controls) and six for identical ground controls. Bioreactors were placed at 37 °C and rotated every 15 min until attachment to the CCM rails together with the flight media bags. CCM rails are organizational subunits within the CCM that facilitate gas and media delivery. Rails were placed into a 37 °C incubator and monitored for contamination. Media was circulated within the ICS of the fibers during the experiment at a flow rate of 6 mL/min. The day prior to launch, the fully loaded rails containing the HT-29 cells, media, fixatives and bacteria (maintained in stasis in DPBS) were integrated into the CCM, which was then sealed, powered and the temperature set to 37 °C. The CCM was turned over to the KSC integration team at L-18 h. STL-IMMUNE launched aboard Space Shuttle Discovery (STS-131) on April 5, 2010 at 6:21 a.m. At approximately L + 3 h, astronauts activated the on-orbit programming of the CCM. On mission elapsed day 11, the CCM was programmed to automatically inject 1 mL (~1 × 107bacteria) into a subset of the hollow fiber bioreactors to enable infection at the apical surface of host cells. Six hours after the bacteria were injected, RNAlater II was injected into the designated bioreactors and the rails were turned off to maintain sample temperature at 29–30 °C until landing. STL-IMMUNE landed at KSC at 9:08 a.m. on April 20, 2010. All bioreactors and bags were removed from the rails and stored at 4 °C. Each reactor was carefully opened, cells and hollow fibers were maintained in RNAlater II at −80 °C until further processing. Inspection of the remaining volumes in the bacterial bags post flight indicated that all infected flight cultures received the intended 1 mL bacterial injection. Infected ground cultures received 0.8 and 0.4 mL injections for two replicates used for both the RNA-seq/iTRAQ analysis, and the third replicate received a 1.2 mL injection (this sample used for iTRAQ analysis only). For processing, RNAlater II-fixed samples were thawed at 4 °C. Samples were concentrated using a Vivaspin 20 (0.2 µm) concentrator. Cells were allowed to settle at 4 °C, the supernatant was removed and then processed for iTRAQ and/or RNA-seq analysis. Isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) analysis RNA was extracted from flight and ground cultures using remaining samples following the proteomics processing. From the remaining samples, RNA-seq analyses were performed using duplicate flight and ground bioreactors for all conditions (n= 2 biological replicates) except for the infected flight samples, which only had sufficient sample remaining to evaluate duplicate technical aliquots from a single bioreactor (i.e.,n= 1 biological;n= 2 technical replicates). RNAlater II-fixed samples were lysed with 700 µl Qiazol (Qiagen), vortexed extensively and passed several times through a 25G needle. After a 5-min static incubation at room temperature with intermittent vortexing, samples were added to MaXtract High-Density tubes (Qiagen) together with 100 µl RNase-free water (Qiagen) and 200 µl chloroform (Sigma-Aldrich). Samples were then processed using the miRNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, including on-column DNase-treatment. RNA was quantified using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer and the integrity validated using an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 to confirm an RNA integrity number (RIN) of 7 or greater for all samples. All RIN were between 7 and 8 except for one of the uninfected ground control samples which had a RIN of 6.4. RNA was fragmented with heat and magnesium to roughly 300 bp using the KAPA HyperPrep RNA-seq kit (Roche). The KAPA Hyper RNA-seq kit and Illumina-compatible adapters (IDT) were used for the remaining library construction. Adapter ligated molecules were cleaned using Kapa pure beads (Kapa Biosciences) and amplified with Kapa HIFI enzyme. Each library was then analyzed for fragment size on an Agilent Tapestation and quantified by qPCR (KAPA Library Quantification Kit) on Quantstudio 5 (ThermoFisher Scientific). Libraries were then multiplexed and sequenced on 2 × 150 flow cells on the NovaSeq platform (Illumina) at University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus Genomics and Microarray Core. RNA-seq reads for each sample were quality checked using FastQC v0.10.1 and aligned to Human GRCh38.p7 primary assembly and S. Typhimurium LT2 genome using STAR v2.5.1b. A series of quality control metrics were generated on the STAR outputs. Cufflinks v2.2.1 was used to report FPKM values (Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads) and read counts. Transcripts per million was calculated by an in-house R script. Differential expression analysis was performed with EdgeR package from Bioconductor v3.2 in R 3.2.3. Multidimensional scaling plots were drawn by plotMDS, in which distances correspond to leading log-fold-changes between samples. For each pairwise comparison, genes with FDR <0.05 were considered significant and log2-fold changes of expression between conditions (logFC) were reported. GO biological process and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis DAVID 6.8 was used to perform the enrichment analysis of RNA-seq data. Data were corrected using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure, had threshold count of 2 and EASE score of 0.05.
